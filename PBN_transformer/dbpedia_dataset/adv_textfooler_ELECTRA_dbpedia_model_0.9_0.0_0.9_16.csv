"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS general hospital [[located]] in [[Dudley]], [[West]] [[Midlands]], [[England]], [[run]] by The [[Dudley]] [[Group]] NHS [[Foundation]] [[Trust]]. The [[hospital]] is [[situated]] south-west of the [[town]] [[centre]] on the A4101 [[road]], which [[connects]] to the Kingswinford [[area]] of the [[borough]]. [[It]] was first planned in the 1960s as a [[general]] [[hospital]] for Dudley and the [[surrounding]] area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in [[May]] that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the [[closure]] of Dudley [[Guest]] Hospital. In 1992, [[plans]] were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as [[well]] as [[parts]] of the Corbett Hospital.

The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf Challenge, [[previously]] [[known]] as the [[Million]] [[Dollar]] [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] men's [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] [[played]] at the [[Gary]] [[Player]] [[Country]] [[Club]] in [[Sun]] [[City]], [[North]] [[West]] [[province]], [[South]] [[Africa]]. Originally it was not an [[official]] [[money]] [[event]] for any of the [[major]] [[tours]], but it [[became]] an [[official]] tournament for the [[Sunshine]] [[Tour]] and European [[Tour]] in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial [[tournaments]] in [[professional]] [[golf]], it [[takes]] [[place]] between the [[conclusion]] of the PGA [[Tour]] in [[early]] [[November]], and [[Christmas]]. [[It]] [[usually]] attracts many of the world's [[highest]] ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine [[Tour]] [[order]] of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings [[following]] the [[U]].[[S]]. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament [[champion]]; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. The 2016 event will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available [[players]] from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The remainder of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years [[winner]] of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations.

"3043 San Diego, provisional [[designation]] 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], Pennsylvania, [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The [[brewery]] is [[well]] [[known]] for its \""[[huge]] [[taste]]\"" beers.

Hops Infusion is one of the [[bitterest]] [[examples]] of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of [[aging]] [[beer]] in [[wooden]] [[barrels]] previously used for aging [[bourbon]].

These [[four]] [[styles]] (imperial [[stout]], barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional [[oak]] and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge [[beers]], though persons [[accustomed]] to more [[mainstream]] [[beer]] may [[find]] them an acquired taste.

The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team. During the 2000–2001 season the team hosted the ECHL All-Star game at Alltel Arena. Head coach Jeff Ward. Assistant coach Brad Gratton. In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central [[Canadiens]] [[Alliance]] team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down. In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–2004 season but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely. In July 2009, Alltel Arena officially became Verizon Arena after Verizon Wireless, Inc. purchased Alltel Corp.",0

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest point of land in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated 693 m (2,274 ft) above sea level.

The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers.
