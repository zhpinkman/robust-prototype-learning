"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"William Harold [[Lee]] (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, [[1971]]) was an American [[20th]] century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a [[prot√©g√©]] of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture.

"[[Archibald]] ([[died]] 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish [[prelate]] best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of [[Moray]] in the years before [[1253]]. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of [[Moray]]. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as [[Dean]] of [[Moray]]. However, the Pope had [[earlier]] or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, [[Nicholas]] de [[Hedon]], based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the [[Papal]] see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was [[absolved]] on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of [[Lyon]]. A provincial council at Perth in [[1273]], however, exempted the Bishop of [[Moray]] as well as the Bishop of [[Dunkeld]]. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in [[1290]]. At some point during his episcopate, [[Uilleam]], Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of [[Archibald's]] cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in [[Cadboll]] and elsewhere in Ross. The [[bishop]] was also involved in a dispute with [[Uilleam]], Mormaer of Mar, which in [[1268]] resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop [[Archibald]] [[built]] an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his [[episcopate]].

"Perfect Records was a [[United]] [[States-based]] record [[label]] [[founded]] in 1922 by Path√© Records to produce [[cheap]] 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown [[shellac]] as opposed to the more common black [[shellac]] of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"".

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the [[short-lived]] Women's Professional [[Basketball]] [[League]]. [[Based]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their [[name]] was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92‚Äì87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league.

In the Midwestern Division for the 1979‚Äì80 season, the Does finished with a record of 11 wins and 24 losses. Their coach for the 1979‚Äì80 season was Larry Costello, who had been the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks for eight seasons, starting in April 1968, and had coached the team to four division titles and an NBA championship in the 1970‚Äì71 season. Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","The Milwaukee Does were a team in the [[—ïhort-lived]] Women's Professional [[Basketba‚Öºl]] [[Legue]].

The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In [[103]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in [[1995]] by Dan and [[Sue]] Weirback. The [[brewery]] is [[well]] known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007.

"[[90377]] [[Sedna]] is a [[large]] minor [[planet]] in the [[outer]] reaches of the Solar System that was, as of [[2015]], at a distance of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune.

Its surface is one of the reddest among [[Solar]] System objects. It is most [[likely]] a dwarf planet. For most of its orbit, it is even [[farther]] from the Sun than at present, with its [[aphelion]] estimated at 937 AU (31 times Neptune's distance), making it one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System other than long-period [[comets]]. Sedna has an exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 years to complete and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76 AU. These [[facts]] have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently [[places]] Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of [[objects]] sent into highly elongated [[orbits]] by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner Oort cloud.

Drummer Mickey Hart and [[non—Äerforming]] lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968‚Äì1970), [[Ketih]] [[Gochaux]] (keyboards; 1971‚Äì1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972‚Äì1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979‚Äì1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990‚Äì1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts. And some members of the band started touring as [[D]] [[ead]] & Company in 2015.

"The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), also referred to as Explorer 66, was a [[satellite]] dedicated to cosmology. Its goals were to investigate the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe and provide measurements that would help shape our understanding of the cosmos.

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann M√ºller. Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, M√ºller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[elctions]] were [[he‚Öºd]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a [[waltz]] by Johann Strauss II [[composed]] in [[1875]] based on themes from his [[operetta]], Cagliostro in Wien which [[premiered]] on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an [[der]] [[Wien]].

It was announced on 22 July [[2010]] that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010.

"Miles \""Milco\"" Copeland is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from the Australian Channel Seven [[soap]] opera Home and Away, played by Josh Quong Tart. He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007. Ryley Mickle and Jackson Edwards played Miles in flashback sequences, showing him at ages three and eight years old respectively. During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets.

The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five ‚Äì four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre Fran√ßois Steyn ‚Äì and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. This gave South Africa a 15‚Äì6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try and also not conceded a try in the final. Each team did have one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second.

It concluded in historic circumstances, when it was dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr as a result of the 1975 constitutional crisis and was succeeded by the Fraser Government. The Whitlam Government remains the only federal government in Australian history to be dismissed by an either a monarch or viceregal representative. The Whitlam Government, while highly controversial during its short tenure, is credited with the implementation of major reforms. Formal relations with China were established, the conscription laws were repealed, all remaining Australian forces were withdrawn from the Vietnam War, and tertiary education fees were abolished.

"Canby Area [[Transit]], or simply CAT, is the public transit bus service provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

It has a hub at the downtown Canby Transit Center. CAT was established as a department of the City of Canby on January 1, 2002 upon Canby's withdrawal from the TriMet service area, and had an official dedication on August 20, 2002. Canby paid TriMet to continue service in the interim, and replaced TriMet's commuter runs in 2004, which received little ridership at the end. CAT also expanded service within the city of Canby, to Woodburn and to Wilsonville, the latter in partnership with Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit. Canby replaced TriMet's payroll tax with its own within the city, but at a somewhat lower rate, and also receives state and federal grants. Due to the loss of state tax credits and recession-caused tax revenue decreases, CAT had to eliminate Saturday service, fixed-route service within Canby and trips to Wilsonville, as well as started charging a $1 fare. In exchange, they started to allow the general public to use dial-a-ride service within Canby that was previously limited to eligible disabled riders, and SMART continued to operate its trips from Wilsonville.","Canby Area [[Transt]], or simply CAT, is the public transit bus service provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

"Eddie [[Stubbs]] ([[born]] [[November]] [[25]], 1961) is a radio disc [[jockey]] broadcasting old-style country music on WSM, a radio station with a nighttime clear channel signal broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, [[United]] States. He is also one of two regular announcers for the long-running Grand Ole Opry carried on WSM on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights. He is on the air on weekday evenings from 7 pm to midnight, Central Time, on WSM. WSM's powerful nighttime clear channel signal allows WSM to be heard in a large part of the US and Canada. As a result, Stubbs has many regular listeners in all parts of the US and Canada in areas far away from Nashville. A fifth-generation resident of Montgomery County, Maryland, he graduated from Gaithersburg (Maryland) High School and became a fiddle player with a traditional bluegrass band, The Johnson Mountain Boys. After a decade, the band split up and Stubbs has only played sporadically since. Stubbs' first [[radio]] [[job]] was a weekly bluegrass show for WYII in Williamsport, Maryland, in [[1983]] where he earned $20 per program. In [[1984]], he was hired by WAMU in Washington, D.C. and worked [[alongside]] the veteran [[country]] deejay [[Gary]] Henderson. He received his own show in [[1990]] but [[continued]] to do odd-jobs such as house-painting to supplement his [[income]]. \""No one gets [[rich]] in radio,\"" he observed. The Eddie Stubbs Show on WAMU was discontinued in April 2007. He developed a friendship with the country singer Kitty Wells and her husband, the guitar player and singer Johnnie Wright, and played with them during D.C. area appearances. They eventually convinced Stubbs to move to Nashville in 1995 and join them full-time. But within seventeen days of arriving in the country music [[capital]], he was hired by The Grand Ole Opry as a regular announcer. \""Five people up for the job, and the new kid in town gets the gig? If that's not God, I don't know what is,\"" [[said]] Stubbs. A self-taught music scholar, he brings an exhaustive knowledge to his radio shows, working without notes during his show which regularly beats FM country stations in Nashville in the Arbitron ratings. In 2002, Stubbs was named the Country Music Association's Large Market Air Personality of the Year. The alternative weekly, Nashville Scene, named him Best Country Deejay, and he has also been listed in Nashville Life magazine's 100 Coolest People.","Eddie [[Subbs]] ([[bor’∏]] [[Novemb–µr]] [[·íø5]], 1961) is a radio disc [[œ≥ockey]] broadcasting old-style country music on WSM, a radio station with a nighttime clear channel signal broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, [[Uniùöùed]] States.

Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood.

"Mortification is an Australian Christian extreme metal [[band]] which was [[formed]] in 1987 as a heavy metal group, Lightforce, by mainstay Steve Rowe on bass guitar and vocals. By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of Moorabbin, they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released over twenty albums and several videos on major record labels such as Nuclear Blast. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups. During the early 1990s Mortification played death metal, thrash, and grindcore, and \""belonged to the elite of the death metal movement,\"" especially with their 1992 album Scrolls of the Megilloth. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with groove metal, hardcore punk and power metal. They achieved commercial success with Blood World in 1994 and received critically acclaim for 1996's EnVision EvAngelene. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, \""the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene\"", and have been described as \""a legend in the death metal scene.\"" In late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukaemia and took 18 months to recover.

"The Irish Independence [[Party]] ([[IIP]]) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, [[founded]] in October 1977 by Frank [[McManus]] (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between [[1970]] and [[1974]]) and Fergus McAteer ([[son]] of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between [[1953]] and [[1969]]). [[The]] party was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the [[two]] movements joined [[IIP]]. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and [[Labour]] Party (SDLP) councillor, [[John]] Turnley, [[later]] the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in [[Carnlough]], County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. [[The]] party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK [[general]] election. Its best result came in the [[Mid]] Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the [[main]] effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. [[The]] [[IIP]] won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of [[1981]] as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne.

[[The]] IIP [[boycotted]] the Assembly [[elections]] in October [[1982]], leaving the field clear for Sinn F√©in, who began standing candidates in elections in the [[early]] 1980s. As a result, the [[IIP]] lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn F√©in stood, in Omagh in [[1983]], the IIP were only [[able]] to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn [[F√©in]] candidate took 60%.

"Luke Bernard James McAllister is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from the British soap opera [[Emmerdale]], played by Noah Huntley. In his first year at Emmerdale he was simply a nice but naive character, but come 1994, his life in the Dales would take a turn for the worse. On 9 August 1994, the Dingle family arrived in Emmerdale, and on that very night during a rave, Ben Dingle started a fight with Luke, during which Ben inexplicably died. The rest of the Dingles believed that Ben had been murdered and proceeded to make Luke's life a living hell. It eventually emerged, however, that Ben was suffering from a heart defect. The Dingles refused to believe this however, theorising that the McAllisters had managed to hide evidence, considering that one of the doctors who examined Ben's body was Luke's father. A family feud between the Dingles and the McAllisters had officially begun. In early 1995, Luke fell, ironically, for Ben's sister Tina after meeting her at a dance. She revealed she was pregnant, much to the dismay of both families. They agreed on marriage on 20 July 1995, and just as it seemed that Luke was finally going to have a happy ending, Tina revealed to him and the wedding guests that she did not love him at all, there was no baby, and this was all in aid of revenge for Ben.

"Ah [[Pook]] Is [[Here]] was a [[collaboration]] between author William S. [[Burroughs]] and artist Malcolm Mc [[Neill]]. It began in 1970, when Burroughs was living in London and Mc [[Neill]] was in his final year of art school. It first appeared under the title The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic [[strip]] in the English Cyclops. When that magazine ceased publication, [[Burroughs]] and Mc Neill decided to develop the concept as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 pages to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in [[San]] Francisco agreed to publish the proposed work in [[1971]] as a \""Word/Image novel\"" which was to comprise [[120]] pages, some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. However, the small advance proffered by the publisher made any more than a few months of working full-time on the project impossible, and when Straight Arrow closed in 1974 the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, Mc [[Neill]] moved to New [[York]] in 1975 to rejoin Burroughs and continue the work. They were unable to find another publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was subsequently published in [[1979]] (by John Calder and Viking Penguin) in text [[form]] only under the original title of Ah Pook Is Here. After 30 years the original visual works were resurrected and restored by Mc Neill for a West [[Coast]] showing at Track 16 Gallery in [[Santa]] Monica, CA, April [[4th]] to May [[2nd]], 2009 and a December 2008 showing in New York at [[Saloman]] Arts Gallery.

"The Vancouver Dragons were a [[professional]] basketball [[team]] in the Continental [[Basketball]] Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts [[center]] [[project]] to the city [[council]] of [[Bellevue]], [[Washington]], an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on [[three]] [[acres]] of city-owned [[land]] [[downtown]]. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a [[CBA]] expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams. This would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; Vancouver's other professional teams were the World Basketball League's Vancouver Nighthawks, the second being the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and the International Basketball League's Vancouver Titans. The Vancouver Dragons deferred participation in the 2007-08 season citing arena issues.

"For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region. The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District.

"Zack Loveday is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from the British soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Duayne Boachie. The character made his first on-screen appearance on 24 February 2015. The show's producer Bryan Kirkwood had created the Loveday family to reintroduce the \""domestic family warmth\"" it had lost. Billed as a \""close-knit family\"", writers also created a series of secrets they character group would be hiding upon their introduction. The audition process for the role of Zack was long and Boachie had various auditions, call backs and screen tests with other actors. Jacqueline Boatswain and Karl Collins were cast as Zack's parents Simone and Louis Loveday respectively. Zack is characterised as a cheeky and charming person who wants to find love. He is sporty and a keen football player. One of the first storylines for the character was the revelation Zack's sister, Lisa, was abducted fourteen years prior to their arrival. Kiza Deen was brought into the show to play the character, but writers introduced a surprise twist in the story where she is revealed to be an impostor named Sonia Albright. Zack is first to discover her deception and they begin a relationship. Simone and Louis learn the truth later on and they forbid their romance. The show later introduced Zack's actual long-lost sister with Rachel Adedeji in the role. A character completely different to Sonia, Lisa is fixated on revenge against Sonia and ensuring Zack stays away from her. This causes a feud between Zack and Lisa.

"Deepgrooves was an Auckland, New Zealand-based independent record [[label]] [[formed]] in 1991 by Bill Latimer, Mark Tierney and Kane Massey. [[Tierney]] left the label eighteen months after the initial release and Latimer followed two months later. Massey continued with the label for approximately ten years working as producer or executive producer on over 20 albums. Deepgrooves is widely seen as being one of the labels at the forefront of the birth of New Zealand's modern music industry in the early 1990s. Distributed by Festival Records (NZ) Ltd., Deepgrooves was responsible for a series of influential jazz and urban releases including early recordings and production work from [[Zane]] Lowe, Phillip [[Fuemana]], [[Justyn]] Pilbrow, Simon Holloway, Mike Hodgson, Anthony [[Ioasa]], [[Joost]] Langeveld and Andrew Morton (aka The [[Submariner]]). [[Throughout]] the 1990s, the label and its artists were nominated for numerous New Zealand Music Awards  including, but not limited to, Most Promising Group and Most Promising Female. It secured wins for Jazz Album of the Year twice. The label also registered numerous Top 10 and Top 40 chart placings over the decade, with its biggest commercial success being the 1994 NZ number one hit, \""Hip Hop Holiday\"" by the group 3 The Hard Way, the first New Zealand hip hop single to reach number one. In 1994, Massey established the label's in-house recording studio and film production company, Kaiun Digital, with Chris Sinclair and Dean Mackenzie.

"Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[center]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered. Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, founder of Still Mind Zendo, has been a Zen teacher since 2000 prior to which she was in private practice as a spiritual director for 15 years, also working as a community organizer and peace activist.
