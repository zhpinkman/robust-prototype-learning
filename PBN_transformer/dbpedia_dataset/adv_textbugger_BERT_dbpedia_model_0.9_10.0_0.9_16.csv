"[[These]] are the results of the women's [[individual]] all-around [[competition]], one of six events for female [[competitors]] in [[artistic]] [[gymnastics]] at the [[2000]] Summer Olympics in [[Sydney]]. [[The]] qualification and [[final]] [[rounds]] [[took]] place on September 17 and 21 at the Sydney SuperDome. The [[all-around]] competition in the discipline of [[women's]] artistic gymnastics (WAG) was marred by three separate scandals.

The apparatus was adjusted during the third rotation and those gymnasts who had vaulted on the incorrectly set equipment were invited to re-do the event at the end of the competition.

"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel [[Winterburn]] made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

At the 2008 Worlds, they placed in last place. The 2008-09 season was slightly better. Martin and his brother played on the Czech team at the 2008 European Mixed Curling Championship, where they won a silver medal, after losing to Germany in the final. At the 2008 European Curling Championships, they improved to a 7th-place finish, and at the 2009 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, they improved to an 11th place showing. Martin had played 2nd on the team at the Euros and third at Worlds. In 2009-10, with Martin at third, the team finished 8th at the 2009 European Curling Championships failing to make it to the World Championships that season. The team improved the following season however, finishing 7th place at the 2010 European Curling Championships, qualifying them once again for the World Championships. At the 2011 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, the team earned their best finish at the worlds to date, placing in 8th. The next season, they had a great run at the 2011 European Curling Championships, making the playoffs for the first time. The team wound wind up placing fourth, after losing the bronze medal match to Denrmark's Rasmus Stjerne. They could not replicate their success however at the 2012 World Men's Curling Championship, where they once again finished last. 2012-13 would be the best season for the Czech team. The team would finish the round robin portion of the 2012 European Curling Championships in 2nd with a 7-2 record. However, the team lost to Norway's Thomas Ulsrud in the semi-final, before rebounding to beat the Danes in the bronze medal match. This would be a first for the country in curling, as it is the first time that the Czech Republic got a medal in international play.",0

"Augustus George Hazard (April 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was [[born]] in Kingston, Rhode Island on April 28, 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was supplying the Union Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a day.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has [[many]] character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies.

"Balaji Baji Rao (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), also known as Nana Saheb, was a Peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire in India. During his tenure, the Chhatrapati ([[Maratha]] king) was reduced to a mere figurehead.

By the end of [[Balaji]] Rao's tenure, the Peshwa was reduced to more of a financier than a general. Unlike his father, Balaji Rao was not a great military leader, and failed to gauge the seriousness of Durrani invasions in northern India.

"Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (Arabic: محمد أحمد ابن عبد الله; August 12, 1844 – June 22, 1885) was a religious leader of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who, on June 29, 1881, proclaimed himself the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith. His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Sudanese population towards the oppressive policies of the Turco-Egyptian rulers, and capitalized on the messianic beliefs popular among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. More broadly, the Mahdiyya, as Muhammad Ahmad's movement was called, was influenced by earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, as well as Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism that developed in reaction to the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century. From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan (known as the Turkiyah). During this period, many of the theological and political doctrines of the [[Mahdiyya]] were established and promulgated among the growing ranks of the Mahdi's supporters, the Ansars. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum, his chief deputy, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad took over the administration of the nascent Mahdist state.","Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (Arabic: محمد أحمد ابن عبد الله; August 12, 1844 – June 22, 1885) was a religious leader of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who, on June 29, 1881, proclaimed himself the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith.

More broadly, the Mahdiyya, as Muhammad Ahmad's movement was called, was influenced by earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, as well as Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism that developed in reaction to the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century. From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan (known as the Turkiyah). During this period, many of the theological and political doctrines of the [[Mahdiуya]] were established and promulgated among the growing ranks of the Mahdi's supporters, the Ansars. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum, his chief deputy, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad took over the administration of the nascent Mahdist state.",0

"The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual [[men's]] professional golf tournament played at the [[Gary]] Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the [[major]] tours, but it became an official tournament for the [[Sunshine]] Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like [[many]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters.

"Aznar (or Asnar) Sánchez (Basque: Aznar Antso, French: Aznard Sanche, Gascon: Aznar Sans) (died 836) was the Duke of Gascony from [[820]]. He was the supposed son of Sancho I of Gascony, though he has been identified with Aznar Galíndez I, Count of Aragon. In 820, Lupo III Centule rose in rebellion against Carolingian authority and Berengar of Toulouse and Guerin of Provence marched against him, defeated him, and installed Aznar, a count of local provenance, in his place. However, both Aragon and Navarre remained outside Carolingian control and western Gascony continued in revolt. In 824, according to the Vita Hludowici, the counts Aznar and Aeblus (Eblus atque Asenarius committees) led an army against rebellious Pamplona. According to the Annales regni Francorum of Einhard, they (Aeblus et Asinarius comites) brought a great deal of wealth with them. They were defeated in a \""second Roncesvalles\"" and Pamplona gained its independence while the two counts were captured. Aznar, however, being a relative (consanguineus) of his captors, according to Astronomus, was released. Aznar fell out with Berengar's successor in the March of Gothia, Bernard of Septimania.

In 836, Aznar was killed (a horrible death) putting down a revolt in Gascony, which had been in tumult since his absence of 824, and was replaced by his brother Sancho, despite the objections of King Pepin.","Aznar (or Asnar) Sánchez (Basque: Aznar Antso, French: Aznard Sanche, Gascon: Aznar Sans) (died 836) was the Duke of Gascony from [[Ȣ20]].

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in [[1290]]. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland. He died on 9 December 1298.","Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope.

"The 1991 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship was the 46th edition of the U.S. Women's Open, held July 11–14 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. Meg Mallon shot a final round 67 (−4) to finish at 283 (−1), two strokes ahead of runner-up Pat Bradley. Mallon trailed Bradley by three strokes with ten holes to play. It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's Open and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest.

The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier.

As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.",5

"Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a [[prior]] of the Carthusian Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. He was [[born]] near Chambéry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm [[continued]] in his [[office]] almost [[constantly]] for [[twenty-four]] [[years]], barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and [[helped]] defend the [[sitting]] [[Pope]] [[Alexander]] [[III]] against the [[antipope]] [[Victor]] IV.

In a [[documentary]] short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of [[bassist]] Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"São Paulo LGBT Pride Parade (Portuguese: [[Parada]] do Orgulho LGBT de São Paulo) is an annual gay pride parade that happens in Avenida Paulista, in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, since 1997. In the year of 2006, it was considered the biggest pride parade of the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$ 1 million reais in the parade. The event is the second largest of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best of the world.

Black is widely regarded as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the 20th century.

During his political [[career]], [[Black]] was regarded as a staunch supporter of liberal policies and civil liberties.

"The [[Lackawanna]] Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad line that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania.

"The Taradale Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray [[River]] Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, [[Wiltshire]], under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[line]]. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. The bridge is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.","The Taradale Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia.

Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[ⅼine]]. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. The bridge is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.",2

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] [[FRCS]] ([[September]] 28, [[1868]] – June 23, [[1963]]), [[served]] as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], from [[1932]] to [[1937]]. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, [[Bruce]] was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the Royal [[College]] of Surgeons. He [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in [[Toronto]] which he [[founded]] in [[1911]], and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during [[World]] War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general [[reorganization]] were immediately feasible from the military and economic [[points-of-view]], and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical [[profession]]. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his conservative [[patron]], [[Hughes]], was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce [[published]] [[Politics]] and the [[Canadian]] Army Medical [[Corps]], [[criticizing]] the [[government]] for its actions but [[avoiding]] any specific denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the [[war]], as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was [[able]] to advance some useful [[reforms]] in surgical management, [[including]] [[greater]] reliance on nurse-anesthetists and [[operating]] room technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don [[Valley]] and [[built]] a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant [[Governor]] of [[Ontario]] by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often [[verbally]] clashed with new Ontario Premier [[Mitch]] Hepburn who attempted to curtail the [[extravagance]] of the vice-regal office in the face of the [[Great]] Depression. The [[lieutenant-governor's]] [[official]] [[residence]], Chorley [[Park]], was [[closed]] by the [[Hepburn]] [[government]] at the end of [[Bruce's]] term on the [[pretext]] of cutting costs. [[While]] most [[lieutenant-governors]] are former politicians, Bruce [[took]] the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the [[King's]] [[representative]]. Following the [[sudden]] [[death]] of Conservative MP [[David]] Spence in the [[middle]] of the [[1940]] federal election [[campaign]], Bruce contested and won [[Spence's]] seat in the [[Canadian]] House of Commons in the [[1940]] federal [[election]]. Sitting as the [[Conservative]] [[Member]] of [[Parliament]] for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June [[23]], 1963.

"Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on 14 April in the Church of Greece. Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy [[born]] in [[Floka]] and [[raised]] in [[Ligouditsa]], both in the [[region]] of Arcadia, [[near]] the regional [[capital]] of [[Tripoli]]. [[As]] with most of Greece at the [[time]], the [[region]] was [[ruled]] by the [[Ottoman]] Empire. His [[mother]] died when he was very young, and his [[father]], [[Elias]], [[remarried]]. Due to [[ill-treatment]] by his [[stepmother]], [[Demetrius]] [[left]] [[home]] and went to seek work in [[Tripoli]], where he was apprenticed to a barber. He [[converted]] to [[Islam]] and took the name [[Mehmet]], but [[later]] repented and became an [[Orthodox]] monk on the island of [[Chios]]. [[Demetrius]] fell into a deep depression when the weight of his [[sin]] [[fully]] weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great [[penance]]: returning to Tripoli to [[confess]] publicly that he was recanting his [[conversion]] to Islam. [[His]] abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and [[publicly]] confessed his re-conversion to [[Christianity]] several times. [[This]] included him going to his former [[barber]] boss and asking him to slit his [[throat]] right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him [[detained]]. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for [[apostasy]] from Islam, convicted and [[sentenced]] to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish [[friend]], who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of [[Demetrius']] confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the [[judge's]] own [[desire]] to [[let]] him go.

[[Aѕ]] with most of Greece at the [[tie]], the [[ⲅegion]] was [[ruld]] by the [[Ottoｍan]] Empire. His [[motheⲅ]] died when he was very young, and his [[fatheⲅ]], [[Eliaѕ]], [[remarrieԁ]]. Due to [[ilⅼ-treatment]] by his [[stepmotheⲅ]], [[Demetriuѕ]] [[lef𝚝]] [[hoｍe]] and went to seek work in [[Tripoⅼi]], where he was apprenticed to a barber. He [[converteԁ]] to [[Islaｍ]] and took the name [[M]] [[ehmet]], but [[latr]] repented and became an [[Orthoԁox]] monk on the island of [[Chi]] [[os]]. [[Demetriuѕ]] fell into a deep depression when the weight of his [[ѕin]] [[fulⅼy]] weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great [[penanϲe]]: returning to Tripoli to [[confesѕ]] publicly that he was recanting his [[converѕion]] to Islam. [[Hs]] abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and [[publicⅼy]] confessed his re-conversion to [[Chrіstianity]] several times. [[Tis]] included him going to his former [[barbeⲅ]] boss and asking him to slit his [[thrat]] right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him [[detaіned]]. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for [[aostasy]] from Islam, convicted and [[sentenceԁ]] to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish [[frienԁ]], who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of [[Demetriuѕ']] confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the [[juԁge's]] own [[desiⲅe]] to [[le𝚝]] him go. Finally, [[Demetriuѕ]] was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully [[sag]] [[Chris𝚝ian]] hymns in his way), and [[publіcly]] executed by beheading; it [[too𝒌]] three strokes, and his severed [[heaԁ]] and [[bodу]], though ordered to be [[burոed]], were [[hiddеn]] and [[prserved]] by local [[Chrіstians]] as relics.",0

In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in [[1962]] [[joined]] Coventry [[City]] as assistant [[manager]]/coach under Jimmy Hill. In 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City. He took the job at the age of just 33, and held it for thirteen years. In that time he consolidated City's position in the Second Division, and eventually, in 1976, led them to promotion to the First Division – then English football's top flight. During his spell as manager the club also made the semi-finals of the 1971 League Cup and won the 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Dicks remained as manager throughout City's four-year stay in Division 1, but relegation and a poor start to the following season saw him leave in October 1980. Subsequently, City suffered three relegations in as many years.

"In Greek mythology, Lepreus (Λεπρεύς) was a son of Caucon (Glaucon) or Pyrgeus, and grandson of Poseidon; one account calls him son of Poseidon. His mother was Astydameia, daughter of Phorbas. Lepreus once advised Augeas to cast Heracles in bonds, so that Augeas wouldn't have to keep his promise to reward Heracles for cleansing of his stables. Since then, Heracles hated Lepreus; but when he came to Caucon's house after [[completing]] his [[twelve]] labors, Astydameia insisted that he reconcile with her son. Lepreus then challenged Heracles to several friendly competitions, namely throwing a discus, drawing water, and seeing which of the two was the fastest eater, each having to consume a bull at a time. Despite his absolute confidence, Lepreus lost all the competitions. After getting beaten in a drinking contest as well, he challenged Heracles to single combat and was killed during the match. Pausanias' account of the story only includes the eating contest, in which Lepreus turned out to be a match for Heracles, but the following single combat has the same result as the other accounts. Lepreus was said to have been buried in Phigalia, but the local inhabitants could not show his tomb.
