"Augustus [[George]] [[Hazard]] ([[April]] 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel [[Augustus]] [[Hazard]], was an [[American]] [[manufacturer]] of [[gunpowder]] and the [[namesake]] of Hazardville, [[Connecticut]].

[[His]] [[family]] [[moved]] to Connecticut when he was [[six]] [[years]] old. [[As]] a young [[man]], he [[worked]] as a [[merchant]] in [[Savannah]], Georgia. [[In]] 1827 he [[relocated]] to [[New]] [[York]] [[City]], where he was a [[commission]] [[agent]] [[engaged]] in the [[sale]] of [[gunpowder]] and other [[products]]. [[In]] 1837 he [[bought]] into a [[gunpowder]] [[production]] [[company]] that [[had]] been [[established]] [[two]] [[years]] [[earlier]] on the Scantic [[River]] in the [[town]] of [[Enfield]], [[Connecticut]].

[[During]] the [[early]] [[years]] of the [[Civil]] [[War]], [[Col]]. [[Hazard]] was under suspicion by the [[federal]] [[government]] as being [[sympathetic]] to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before [[South]] Carolina seceded from the [[Union]], it bought 80,000 [[lbs]]. of [[powder]] that was used to propel the first [[shots]] [[fired]] on [[Fort]] Sumter. [[In]] [[fact]], [[much]] of the powder in the [[Southern]] Arsenals at the [[outset]] of the [[war]] was manufactured by the [[Connecticut]] [[company]]. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs.

"90377 Sedna is a large minor [[planet]] in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune.

"The [[Word]] is an [[American]] instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar.

"The Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system. Those who adopted these new forms of public mobilization for democratic reform in Upper Canada were inspired by the more radical Owenite Socialists who led the British Chartist and Mechanics Institute movements.","The Reform [[move]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues.
