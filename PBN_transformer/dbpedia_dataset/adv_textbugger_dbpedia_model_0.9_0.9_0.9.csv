She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (ÁôΩËõáJP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D.

The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama („Éä„Éº„Éû), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (ÁôΩËõá„ÅÆ„Éä„Éº„Ç¨ SƒÅpento no NƒÅga) is a [[fitional]] [[charater]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"Northampton /n…îÀêÀàŒ∏√¶mpt…ôn/ is the county [[town]] of [[Northamptonshire]] in the East Midlands of England. It lies on the River Nene, about 67 miles (108 km) north-west of London and 50 miles (80 km) south-east of Birmingham. One of the largest towns in the UK, Northampton had a population of 212,100 in the 2011 census. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze [[Age]], Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the [[town]] rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of [[Northampton]], which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by King Richard I in [[1189]] and its first mayor was appointed by King John in [[1215]]. The town is also the site of [[two]] medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in [[1460]]. Northampton's royal connection [[languished]] in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The town also suffered the Great Fire of Northampton (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the [[18th]] century. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union Canal and the arrival of the railways in the [[19th]] century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and leather manufacture. After the World Wars, Northampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a New Town in 1968, accelerating development in the town. Northampton unsuccessfully applied for unitary status in 1996 and city status in 2000; the town continues to expand with many areas undergoing urban renewal. According to Centre for Cities data in 2015, Northampton had a population growth of 11.3% between the years 2004 and 2013, one of the ten highest in the UK.","Northampton /n…îÀêÀàŒ∏√¶mpt…ôn/ is the county [[twon]] of [[Northampton]] [[shire]] in the East Midlands of England.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes [[well-known]] musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi [[Allstars-]] Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[‚Öºine]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"The Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box girder [[bridge]] over [[Back]] Creek at [[Taradale]], [[Victoria]] on the [[Bendigo]] Railway in Victoria Australia.

Construction of the [[Bendigo]] [[line]] commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian [[Railways]] Department. [[The]] design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., [[Surveyor-General]] of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and [[O'Hara]] The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for ¬£3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 [[June]] 1858.

"Ethno Jazz, a [[form]] of Ethno Music, is sometimes equaled to World Music or is regarded as its successor, particularly before the 1990s. An independent meaning of \""Ethno Jazz\"" emerged around 1990 with globalisation and later the Internet as well as the commercial success of Ethno groups and musicians. From the American and European view, interpretations from developing countries, particularly the developing southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China, became important. Whereas global regions like India, Latin America and Africa had been reached already before 1990, they regained importance in the form of Ethno Music, and Ethno Jazz in particular. Notable examples are the emergence of jazz through the interaction between New Orleans and Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz in the 1940s and 1950s, Arab influence in Jazz in the 1950s and 1960s and Indian influence through The Beatles and Rock Jazz of the 1960s and 1970s. Ethno Jazz, particularly from the 1990s, meant Jazz was in accordance with the more American and European view, but realised with the typical musical differences of non-American and -European regions, particularly the expanding centres of Southeast Asia and China.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland.

"The Newcastle Jets [[2010]]‚Äì11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"[[Eddie]] [[Stubbs]] (born November 25, 1961) is a radio disc [[jockey]] broadcasting old-style country music on WSM, a radio station with a nighttime clear channel signal broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, United States. He is also one of two regular announcers for the long-running Grand Ole Opry carried on WSM on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights. He is on the air on weekday evenings from 7 pm to midnight, Central Time, on WSM. [[WSM's]] powerful nighttime clear channel signal allows WSM to be heard in a large part of the US and Canada. As a result, Stubbs has many regular listeners in all parts of the US and Canada in areas far away from Nashville.

"[[1750]] [[Eckert]], provisional designation [[1950]] [[NA1]], is a stony [[asteroid]], slow [[rotator]], and Mars-crosser from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by [[German]] astronomer Karl Reinmuth at [[Heidelberg]] Observatory on 15 July 1950. [[The]] [[asteroid]] is a member of the Hungaria family, a group that forms the [[innermost]] dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar [[System]]. It measures about 7 kilometers in diameter and orbits the Sun at a distance of [[1]].6‚Äì2.3 AU once every 2 years and 8 months ([[977]] days). Its orbit shows an [[eccentricity]] of 0.17 and is tilted by 19 degrees to the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Every 375 hours, it slowly rotates once around its axis. This is the sixth-longest rotation period of all known [[Mars-crossing]] asteroids. The S-type [[asteroid]] has an albedo of 0.20, [[based]] on [[observations]] by the Japanese [[Akari]] satellite.

"Bonnie-Briar County Club is an 18-hole [[golf]] [[course]] and country club located in the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. The course architect was A. W. Tillinghast, one of the most prolific architects in the history of golf, and designer of nearby Southern Westchester courses including Quaker Ridge Golf Club, Wykagyl Country Club and Winged Foot Golf Club. The course design made excellent use of Bonnie Briar's hilly and low wetland areas, surrounding a wooded interior. A.H. Tull, Geoffrey Cornish and Robert Trent also contributed to various aspects of the course layout, drainage, tees, greens and bunkers. After World War I, real estate activity in the Town of Mamaroneck surged and the number of families moving into the area brought about a need for country and beach clubs which were then few in number. The land had belonged to the Lyman Bill estate. Colonel E. Lyman Bill, a successful publisher and one of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, had owned a large piece of property along the Mamaroneck and New Rochelle border, on which he had a private club with tennis courts and a rudimentary golf course. The first and ninth fairways became the site of the first golf layout in the United States. The Colonel wanted to build a palatial residence on his estate, yet died before its completion. The Bonnie Briar Country Club was then organized in 1921 with the financial assistance of the Bill family. The first president was the Colonel's son, Edward Lyman Bill, who finished construction of the clubhouse. The course officially opened on July 15, 1923. Norman Rockwell was a member of Bonnie Briar when he lived in nearby New Rochelle. In 1961, Judy Garland lived in a house at 1 Cornell Street in Scarsdale, which is right around the corner from Bonnie Briar Country Club.","Bonnie-Briar County Club is an 18-hole [[golùöè]] [[co’Ωrse]] and country club located in the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York.

"[[Cape]] Horn (Dutch: , Spanish: Cabo de Hornos), named after the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands, is the [[southernmost]] [[headland]] of the Tierra del [[Fuego]] [[archipelago]] of southern Chile, and is located on the small Hornos Island. Although not the most southerly point of South America (which are the Diego Ram√≠rez Islands), Cape Horn marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans collide. For decades it was a major milestone on the [[clipper]] route, by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and Icebergs; these dangers have made it notorious as a [[sailors']] graveyard. The need for ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point). Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the VELUX 5 Oceans, and the Vend√©e Globe, sail around the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route. There have been a number of small boat roundings of the Horn but one in particular stands out: Howard Rice sailed and paddled a 15-foot (4.6 m) wood canvas folding canoe doubling the Horn. In 1987 The British Cape Horn Expedition, headed by Nigel H [[Seymour]], rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing kayaks' called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing positions between the [[two]] kayaks.","[[Cpe]] Horn (Dutch: , Spanish: Cabo de Hornos), named after the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands, is the [[souther’∏most]] [[healdand]] of the Tierra del [[Fueo]] [[archipelgo]] of southern Chile, and is located on the small Hornos Island. Although not the most southerly point of South America (which are the Diego Ram√≠rez Islands), Cape Horn marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans collide. For decades it was a major milestone on the [[clip]] [[per]] route, by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and Icebergs; these dangers have made it notorious as a [[sailors`]] graveyard. The need for ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point).

"The 29th Illinois General Assembly was [[elected]] in November 1874. The session began on January 6, 1875 and adjourned on April 15, 1875. No party had a majority in either chamber. The Republicans had a plurality in both chambers, with 24 members in the Senate and 69 in the House, but control of the chambers was held by a coalition of Democrats, third parties, and independents. The third parties represented in this session included the Opposition Party, the Independent Reform Party, and the Democratic Liberal Party, which took many of its members (including its leader, former governor John M. Palmer) and positions from the defunct Liberal Republican Party of 1872. All of these parties were organized for the first time in 1874 and disappeared shortly thereafter, their members subsequently becoming Democrats, Greenbackers, or independents. The three-sided tensions between Democrats, Republicans and reformers led to frequent turmoil during the session, including a violent brawl that erupted in the House when Republican Alfred M. Jones threw a book at Democrat Lewis Plater. Partly due to this climate, fewer laws were passed during this session than any session since the 1830s; amounting to only 118 pages. The expenses incurred by this General Assembly were also commensurately lower, at $221,810‚Äîless than half the amount incurred by the preceding 28th General Assembly.

The third and present edifice was built in 1869-1871 of native blue limestone and described as being \""plain but beautiful...in its simple style of architecture.\"" While described as simple, the building is a combination of architectural styles that is chiefly Italianate and Renaissance Revival architecture but incorporates elements associated with the Classical Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The [[curch]] was damaged in an 1893 fire, and restored with funds from parishioners, including Newton industrialist Henry W. Merriam (1828‚Äì1900). At this time, Merriam donated several stained glass windows, including one over the altar depicting Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. On 26 October 1979, the First Presbyterian Church of Newton was placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places. It is also included as part of the Newton Town Plot Historic District which was approved and entered on the National Register of Historic Places on 12 November 1992. The current pastor (2013‚Äìpresent) of the First Presbyterian Church of Newton is the Rev. David E. Young. Ordained in 1987, he is a graduate of The College of Wooster; University of Maryland, College Park; and Princeton Theological Seminary, and has served Presbyterian congregations in Stillwater, New Jersey; Fargo, North Dakota; Midland, Minnesota; and New Albany, Indiana, before accepting a pastoral call to Newton.",2
