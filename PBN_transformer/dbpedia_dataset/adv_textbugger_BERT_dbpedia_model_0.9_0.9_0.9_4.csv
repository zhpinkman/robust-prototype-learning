"[[Yesterday's]] [[Children]] were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck [[Maher]] (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic [[nuance]] into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

"[[Archibald]] (died [[1298]]) was a [[13th-century]] Scottish [[prelate]] best [[known]] for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 [[December]] 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in 1290. At some point during his [[episcopate]], [[Uilleam]], Mormaer of Ross, [[committed]] an [[outrage]] to the church or [[lands]] of Petty, a church [[belonging]] to a [[canon]] of [[Archibald's]] cathedral. In compensation, [[Uilleam]] [[granted]] the [[bishop]] some [[lands]] in [[Cadboll]] and elsewhere in Ross. [[The]] [[bishop]] was also involved in a [[dispute]] with [[Uilleam]], Mormaer of Mar, which in [[1268]] [[resulted]] in the latter's [[excommunication]].

As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.",0

Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] [[written]] and illustrated by [[Japanese]] [[author]] Taishi [[Za≈ç]] (also known for her sh≈çjo works under the [[name]] Mikiyo Tsuda) in [[2002]]. The [[story]] focuses on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has [[fewer]] foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in [[turn]] follows Tamura [[around]], wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no [[apparent]] reason and demanding an explanation.

"[[Herbert]] [[Alexander]] [[Bruce]] [[FRCS]] (September [[28]], [[1868]] ‚Äì June 23, 1963), [[served]] as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of [[Ontario]], Canada, from [[1932]] to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, [[Ontario]] near Port [[Perry]], Bruce was [[educated]] as a surgeon at the University of [[Toronto]] and in [[Paris]] and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned [[Wellesley]] Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the [[University]] of Toronto. In [[1916]], during World War I, he was appointed [[inspector-general]] of the [[Canadian]] Army Medical [[Corps]] by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of [[colonel]] in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active [[Militia]]). [[Bruce]] investigated medical [[practices]] in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which [[urged]] a complete [[reorganization]] of the medical corps. [[Few]] of his [[recommendations]] for general [[reorganization]] were immediately [[feasible]] from the military and economic points-of-view, and the [[manner]] of his appointment was [[protested]] by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was [[disowned]] by the government at the [[time]] and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his conservative patron, Hughes, was [[obliged]] to resign. In [[1919]], Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical [[consultant]] to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in [[surgical]] management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until [[1937]]. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the [[extravagance]] of the vice-regal office in the face of the [[Great]] Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of [[Bruce's]] term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his [[term]] as the King's [[representative]]. Following the [[sudden]] [[death]] of Conservative MP David [[Spence]] in the middle of the [[1940]] [[federal]] election campaign, Bruce contested and won [[Spence's]] seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"The SM Kirov Stadium was a [[multi-purpose]] [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The stadium was named after Sergey [[Kirov]]. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr [[Nikolsky]] and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, [[Zenit]] and Dynamo, drew [[1-1]]. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. [[Kirov]] stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the [[Goodwill]] Games, the stadium was used for several more years for [[football]] matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the [[main]] arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect [[Kisho]] Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in [[1950-1989]] and 1992. On 6 July 2006 [[Zenit]] decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of [[unavailability]] of [[pitch]] at the Petrovsky [[Stadium]], the current Zenit [[ground]]. [[Part]] of the seats were already [[uninstalled]] because of [[planned]] deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006.

"The National Football League [[playoffs]] for the 2010 season began on January 8, 2011.

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

"[[The]] Raving Loony Green [[Giant]] [[Party]] was a political [[party]] in the United Kingdom.

"No. 51 [[Squadron]] RAF [[Regiment]] is a field [[squadron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air Force. [[Its]] mission is protection of [[RAF]] bases from ground attack. [[The]] history of No. 51 [[Squadron]] goes back to [[1947]] when it was [[formed]] at RAF Celle near the L√ºneburg [[Heath]] in Germany by the [[redesignation]] of No. [[2713]] Squadron RAF Regiment. [[Its]] initial role was as a rifle squadron, protecting RAF facilities from [[ground]] [[attack]]. In 1955 it changed to the light [[anti-aircraft]] role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. In [[1964]] the [[squadron]] reformed, switching back to the rifle role, at the RAF [[Regiment]] Depot. The [[first]] assignments of the [[unit]] after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook internal security [[roles]]. After Rhodesia [[unilaterally]] declared independence in 1965 it was [[sent]] to [[Africa]] to protect [[Gloster]] [[Javelin]] aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. [[After]] returning to Catterick the [[unit's]] next [[deployment]] was back to Aden in the immediate period before the British withdrawal from there in 1967. Its [[service]] in [[Aden]] was mainly spent at the [[many]] isolated airfields dotting that colony. In [[1968]] the squadron shifted bases with a move to RAF Wittering. This move was undertaken to support the [[Hawker]] Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming operational. With the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, No. 51 Squadron deployed to the province, a process which it would repeat at regular intervals for the next 18 years. This period also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and Hong Kong. In 1982 the squadron moved back to Catterick from Wittering to re-role. It emerged operating the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked) family and in wartime it would have moved to Germany to defend airfields there. However its next war service was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. In aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the squadron deployed to Arabia and detachments saw service at [[Dharan]], Muharraq and Tabuk during the war. Following the Options for Change defence cuts the squadron was disbanded in 1993. The dawn of a new century saw a return to active service for the squadron. Once again operating in a field squadron role, it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before moving to RAF Lossiemouth. It was not long before [[war]] beckoned again and the squadron was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the invasion it has taken part in roulements back to the region. Most recently, [[20]] personnel from the [[Regiment]] deployed in support of [[Operation]] Shader.","No. 51 [[Squad‚≤Öon]] RAF [[Regime’∏t]] is a field [[sq’Ωadron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air Force.

"[[The]] [[Somonyng]] of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[play]]. Like John [[Bunyan's]] 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The [[play]] is the allegorical [[accounting]] of the [[life]] of Everyman, who represents all [[mankind]].

"William [[Froude]] (/ÀàfruÀêd/; [[28]] November [[1810]] in [[Devon]] ‚Äì 4 May 1879 in [[Simonstown]], South Africa) was an [[English]] [[engineer]], [[hydrodynamicist]] and [[naval]] [[architect]]. He was the [[first]] to [[formulate]] reliable [[laws]] for the resistance that [[water]] offers to [[ships]] (such as the hull speed equation) and for [[predicting]] their [[stability]]. [[Froude]] was [[born]] at Dartington, [[Devon]], [[England]], the [[son]] of [[Robert]] [[Froude]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Totnes]] and was educated at Westminster School and Oriel College, [[Oxford]], graduating with a first in mathematics in 1832. His first employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which, in 1837, [[led]] to [[Brunel]] giving him responsibility for the [[construction]] of a section of the [[Bristol]] and [[Exeter]] Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track [[transition]] curves and [[introduced]] [[analternative]] design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction, near [[Exeter]]. [[At]] [[Brunel's]] invitation [[Froude]] turned his attention to the stability of [[ships]] in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the [[Institution]] of Naval [[Architects]] became influential in [[ship]] design. This led to a [[commission]] to [[identify]] the most [[efficient]] [[hull]] shape, which he was [[able]] to fulfil by [[reference]] to scale models: he [[established]] a [[formula]] (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale [[tests]] [[could]] be [[used]] to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of [[3]], 6 and (shown in the [[picture]]) 12 foot [[scale]] models and used them in towing trials to [[establish]] resistance and scaling [[laws]]; Raven's [[sharp]] prow [[followed]] the \""waveline\"" [[theory]] of John Scott Russell, but Swan's blunter profile proved to offer lower resistance. [[His]] experiments were vindicated in full-scale [[trials]] [[conducted]] by the Admiralty and as a result the [[first]] [[ship]] [[test]] [[tank]] was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was [[able]] to combine [[mathematical]] [[expertise]] with [[practical]] [[experimentation]] to such [[good]] effect that his [[methods]] are [[still]] [[followed]] today. In 1877, he was [[commissioned]] by the Admiralty to produce a [[machine]] capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large [[naval]] engines. He [[invented]] and built the [[world's]] [[first]] water brake dynamometer, sometimes known as the [[hydraulic]] dynamometer, which led to the formation of Heenan & [[Froude]] Ltd in [[Birmingham]]. [[He]] died while on [[holiday]] (as an official guest of the Royal Navy) in Simonstown, South Africa, and was buried there with full naval honours. He was the brother of James Anthony Froude, a historian, and Hurrell Froude, writer and priest.

"[[McKeon]] [[Pavilion]] is a [[3]],[[500]] seat multi-purpose [[arena]] at [[Saint]] Mary's [[College]] of California in Moraga, California. Home men's and women's [[basketball]] and volleyball games are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly [[bleacher-style]], not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project. With gym renovations years away, the college has made several upgrades to the facility. Prior to the 2005-2006 season new floors were installed. Before the 2006-2007 season, the lower level reserved seating (directly behind the benches) was changed from bleachers to stadium-style seats with backs. The bleachers in the student section (also known as Gaelforce) - opposite the benches - were painted dark blue. Large banners were hung from the railings separating the upper and lower seating sections, reading \""Saint Mary's College\"" behind the reserved seating and \""Gaelforce\"" behind the student section. More recently, the student section has been filled with Australian flags, reflecting the prevalence of Australians on the Gaels squad, including former star Patty Mills. In recent memory, the gym has seen the 2001 women's basketball team and the 2005 men's basketball team reach the NCAA Tournament. The women's volleyball team has also achieved much success, reaching the post-season in 2004-2006.

"[[Cheung]] [[Lai]] [[Chuen]] was a Chinese martial [[artist]]. He was [[born]] in [[1882]] during the Qing dynasty. He was a student of many great Kung Fu [[masters]] and mastered the Lei Ga (ÊùéÂÆ∂, Lee Style), Southern Dragon Kung Fu, Lau Man [[Gaau]] (ÊµÅÊ∞ëÊïô, Vagabond or Wanderer's Style), and [[Bak]] Mei (White Eyebrow Style). He was responsible for codifying the latter. He began his study of the martial arts at the age of 7 with the traditional Chinese [[medicine]] [[practitioner]] Sek Lam, who taught him the [[vagrant]] [[style]]. Jeung would later [[learn]] Li Style from Li [[Mung]], (founded by Li Yi, ÊùéÁæ©) who [[taught]] Jeung his family style. While he was [[studying]] [[martial]] arts with the Lam family, he became close friends with their son Lam [[Yiu]] Gwai, with whom he had much in common, and [[eventually]] studied under Yiu Gwai's [[uncle]]. [[Lam]] would [[later]] become known for disseminating Dragon Kung Fu much as Jeung [[would]] [[later]] [[become]] known for disseminating Bak Mei. Both were born in Huiyang District in [[Huizhou]], Guangdong province. and a marriage between their families would eventually make them cousins. They both [[left]] Huizhou to build their futures in Guangzhou and did so by opening [[several]] [[schools]] together.

"Pierre Charles Fournier de [[Saint-Amant]] ([[12]] [[September]] [[1800]] ‚Äì 29 October [[1872]]) was a [[leading]] French [[chess]] master and an editor of the [[chess]] [[periodical]] Le Palam√®de. He is best known for losing a match against Howard Staunton in 1843 that is often considered to have been an unofficial match for the World [[Chess]] Championship. [[Saint-Amant]] learned chess from Wilhelm Schlumberger, who later became the operator of The Turk. He played at the Caf√© de la R√©gence, where he was a student of [[Alexandre]] [[Deschapelles]]. [[For]] [[many]] [[years]] he [[played]] on level terms with Boncourt, a [[strong]] player, and [[received]] odds of pawn and [[two]] moves from [[Deschapelles]] and Louis-Charles Mah√© [[de]] La [[Bourdonnais]]. In [[1834]]‚Äì36, he [[led]] a Paris team that won both games of a correspondence [[chess]] match against the Westminster Club, then England's [[leading]] chess club. [[After]] La [[Bourdonnais']] death in 1840, he was [[considered]] the [[country's]] best [[player]]. In December [[1841]] he [[revived]] Le Palam√®de (at its inception in [[1836]] the [[world's]] first [[chess]] periodical), which ran until 1847. He played two [[matches]] against Staunton in 1843.

This [[second]] match is [[sometimes]] considered an unofficial world championship match. In [[1858]], Saint-Amant [[played]] in the Birmingham [[tournament]], a knockout event. He won in the first round, but lost in the second by a 2‚Äì1 score to Ernst [[Falkbeer]]. Returning to Paris, he witnessed the [[adulatory]] reception accorded Paul Morphy at the Caf√© de la R√©gence. The [[score]] of one game between them is [[known]], a 22-move rout by [[Morphy]] of Saint-Amant and his [[consultation]] partner, given as \""F. [[de]] L.\"" or \""F. [[de]] L'A\"". Outside of [[chess]], [[Saint-Amant]] became a government clerk in Paris at an early [[age]]. He then served as the secretary to the governor of French Guiana from 1819 to 1821. He was dismissed from that appointment after he protested against the slave trade that still existed in that [[colony]]. [[After]] that, he tried his hand as a journalist and actor, then became a [[successful]] wine merchant. He was a [[captain]] in the French National Guard during the 1848 revolution. For his role in saving the Palais [[des]] Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851‚Äì52, he was the French consul to California.

It is considered to be the flagship event of the International Basketball Federation. The championship has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1950, except for two occasions.

From 1986 through 2014, the men's and women's championships were held in the same year, though in different countries. The current format of the tournament involves 24 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the Naismith Trophy, first awarded in 1967. The current champions are the United States, who defeated Serbia in the final of the 2014 tournament. Following the 2014 FIBA championships for men and women, the men's World Cup was scheduled on a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. The next men's World Cup will be held in 2019, in the year following the FIFA World Cup.

The current format of the tournament involves 24 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the Naismith Trophy, first awarded in 1967. The current champions are the United States, who defeated Serbia in the final of the 2014 tournament. Following the 2014 FIBA championships for men and women, the men's World Cup was scheduled on a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup. The next men's World Cup will be held in 2019, in the year following the FIFA World Cup. The women's championship, which was renamed from \""FIBA World Championship for Women\"" to \""FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup\"" after its 2014 edition, will remain on the previous four-year cycle, with championships in the same year as the FIFA World Cup. The 1994 FIBA World Championship was the first FIBA World Cup tournament in which currently active American NBA players, that had also already played in an official NBA regular season game were allowed to participate. All FIBA World Championship/World Cup tournaments from the 1994 edition onward, are thus considered as fully professional level tournaments.",0

The motto Vocati Veniemus may be freely translated as \""when summoned we shall be there\"". The collapse of the Warsaw Pact resulted in a large reduction of NATO forces in central Europe.

"[[Presidential]] [[elections]] were held in France on 24 [[April]] and [[8]] May [[1988]]. In [[1981]], the Socialist [[Party]] [[leader]], Fran√ßois Mitterrand, was [[elected]] President of France and the Left won the [[legislative]] [[election]]. However, in 1986, the [[right]] regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \""reserved domain\"" ‚Äì foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates opposed the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet advocated liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by President Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was challenged by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", claiming that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth Republic\"". He appeared as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he announced his candidacy, Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by SOFRES polls institute, against 23% for Barre. But, from the start of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and took the lead among the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist candidate was uncertain. Mitterrand said he was not sure he would run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel Rocard campaigned for the nomination. The favourite to win the [[election]] according to the polls, the [[incumbent]] president announced his candidacy at the end of [[March]]. He wrote an open letter to the French, where he proposed a [[moderate]] [[programme]] (\""neither nationalisations, nor privatizations\"") and advocated a \""[[united]] France\"" against \""the appropriation of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the [[RPR]]. He benefited from the decline of the French [[Communist]] Party, represented by Andr√© Lajoinie. Lajoinie was [[faced]] with competition for the [[far-left]] vote by a \""[[reforming]] [[Communist]]\"", Pierre Juquin and a [[Trotskyist]], [[Arlette]] Laguiller. [[Meanwhile]], the Ecologist Antoine Waechter [[refused]] to ally the Greens with either the left or the right.

"The [[Vancouver]] Dragons were a [[professional]] basketball [[team]] in the Continental [[Basketball]] [[Association]] (CBA), and one of [[seven]] ([[7]]) [[minor]] [[league]] sports [[franchises]] [[owned]] by Seattle attorney and businessman [[Michael]] Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, [[LLC]]. Tuckman [[negotiated]] a [[three-year]] lease with the [[Pacific]] National Exhibition in [[Vancouver]], [[British]] Columbia to [[play]] 24 [[home]] games each [[year]] in the 4,[[500-seat]] Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was [[awarded]] the [[2010]] [[Winter]] Olympics and the [[Dragon's]] lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor [[sports]] facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, [[Tuckman]] proposed a $150 million sports arena and [[performing]] [[arts]] [[center]] project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle [[suburb]], to be built on three acres of city-owned [[land]] [[downtown]]. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign [[long-term]] [[leases]] in order to obtain financing for his [[project]], so he [[paid]] $[[125]],000 in cash in [[2003]] to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for [[Bellevue]] to become an [[anchor]] tenant. The [[league]] gave [[Tuckman]] [[permission]] to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic [[Center]] [[Arena]] was being built at NE 8th and [[112th]] NE across the [[street]] from the [[Meydenbauer]] [[Convention]] Center. When it was determined that [[BCC]] would not be a suitable venue for [[pro]] [[basketball]], Tuckman moved the team to [[Vancouver]] and changed the [[name]] to the Dragons. In a [[2006]] [[interview]] with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, [[Tuckman]] [[cited]] one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they [[left]] the [[United]] [[States]] to [[play]] a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. [[The]] Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams. [[This]] would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; Vancouver's other [[professional]] teams were the World [[Basketball]] League's [[Vancouver]] Nighthawks, the second being the NBA's Vancouver [[Grizzlies]] and the International Basketball League's Vancouver Titans. [[The]] Vancouver Dragons deferred participation in the [[2007-08]] [[season]] citing arena issues.
