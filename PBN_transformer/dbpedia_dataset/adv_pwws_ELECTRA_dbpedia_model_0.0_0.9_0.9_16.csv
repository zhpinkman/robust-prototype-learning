"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, [[West]] [[Midlands]], England, run by The Dudley Group [[NHS]] [[Foundation]] [[Trust]].

In April 1998, however, it was [[decided]] that Wordsley Hospital would [[close]] [[completely]] and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient [[services]]. The [[first]] phases of the [[work]] were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells [[Hall]] had [[doubled]] in size.

"Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the [[light]] novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise [[Slayers]], who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series [[Slayers]] Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictitious]] [[grapheme]] in the [[fall]] novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise [[killer]], who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli.

"[[John]] P. Loftus (October 13, 1895 – March 23, 1976) was an American thoroughbred [[horse]] [[racing]] [[Hall]] of [[Fame]] [[jockey]]. [[Born]] in Chicago, Illinois, [[Johnny]] Loftus was the first [[jockey]] to win the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. During his career, between 1909 and 1919, he won 580 races out of the 2,449 he competed in, for a very notable 23.7% success rate. In 1916 he won the Travers Stakes and Withers Stakes on \""Spur\"" then captured the Kentucky Derby aboard George Smith. In 1917 he won the Kentucky Oaks with the filly Sunbonnet and the next year he rode War Cloud to victory in the Preakness Stakes. As well, Loftus rode Man o' War to victory in eight races, and to the only defeat in the horse's career, a second-place finish at the Sanford Memorial Stakes. For trainer H. Guy Bedwell and Canadian owner J. K. L. Ross, who owned a farm in Maryland, in 1919 Johnny Loftus rode Sir Barton to victory in the Kentucky Derby then only four days later won the Preakness Stakes. They went on to win the Belmont Stakes becoming the first-ever American Triple Crown winner. Loftus ended up as 1919's top money-winning jockey in the U.S.A. and retired at the end of the racing season to become a horse trainer. In 1938 and 1939, he enjoyed success as the trainer of Pompoon who was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 1936. In 1959, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.
