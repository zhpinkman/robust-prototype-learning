The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the [[field]] were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf [[Challenge]], previously [[known]] as the [[Million]] [[Dollar]] [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] men's [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the [[Gary]] [[Player]] [[Country]] [[Club]] in Sun City, [[North]] West [[province]], South [[Africa]]. Originally it was not an official money event for any of the major [[tours]], but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine [[Tour]] and European [[Tour]] in [[2013]]. Like [[many]] [[high-profile]] unofficial tournaments in [[professional]] [[golf]], it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA [[Tour]] in [[early]] [[November]], and Christmas. [[It]] [[usually]] [[attracts]] many of the [[world's]] highest ranked [[players]]. [[The]] tournament was a 12-player invitational [[stroke]] play event, with the field being [[made]] up of defending [[champion]], the Sunshine [[Tour]] [[order]] of merit [[winner]], the [[four]] major winners and then completed with the [[top]] [[players]] in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA [[Championship]]. In 2006, the [[tournament]] carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending [[tournament]] [[champion]]; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 [[European]] [[Tour]] Race to Dubai players; the [[Sunshine]] [[Tour]], Asian [[Tour]], Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of [[Australasia]] Order of [[Merit]] winners; the [[Alfred]] Dunhill [[Championship]] winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. [[From]] 2000 to 2002 the [[first]] prize was increased to US$[[2]] million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to [[around]] 30%.

"The New Guinea bockadam or [[dog-faced]] water snake, Cerberus [[rynchops]], is a species of a [[colubrid]] snake found in coastal waters of Asia and Australia. C. rynchops is commonly found in mangroves, mudflats, streams, ponds, tidal pools, on algae patches, and has even been found burrowing into the mud. C. [[rynchops]] is rear-fanged and is mildly venomous. An aquatic and nocturnal snake, it feeds mainly on fish and is known to consume eels. In captivity, it is observed to move in a sidewinding direction on land. In the BBC series 'Life in Cold Blood' it was filmed adapting this sidewinding technique to jump across a mudflat in Singapore ( up until then no snakes were considered able to truly jump ). It also has a prehensile tail that would suggest it could climb mangrove trees. It is now known to give birth to live young, numbering from 8 to 30, either in water or on land. It is a quite docile, mild-tempered and a hardy snake; in recent years it has become a welcome addition to snake hobbyists in the Philippines. It also owes its popularity to its bright yellow to orange belly coloring, mostly of females.","The New Guinea bockadam or [[dog-face‘Å]] water snake, Cerberus [[rynchop—ï]], is a species of a [[colubid]] snake found in coastal waters of Asia and Australia.

[[The]] S-type asteroid is a member of the [[Flora]] family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the plane of the ecliptic.

Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in [[red-brown]] shellac as opposed to the more common [[black]] shellac of the era. [[Pathe's]] acoustic [[recording]] technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the [[music]] to [[create]] the [[disc]] master. This didn't degrade the sound [[quality]], but records [[produced]] this [[way]] tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record [[sleeve]] was \""Better records [[can't]] be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, [[Vernon]] Dalhart, [[Walter]] Dalton, [[Morton]] Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and [[Boyd]] Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.","Perfect [[R]] [[ecords]] was a United States-based record [[labe‚Öº]] founded in 1922 by Path√© Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

"Pandora (/[[p√¶nÀàd…î…ôr…ô]]/ pan-DOHR-…ô; Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œéœÅŒ±) is an inner [[satellite]] of [[Saturn]].

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], [[approximately]] [[4]].7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor [[Helin]] on 30 September [[1982]], at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the [[Hungaria]] family, which form the [[innermost]] dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar [[System]]. [[The]] asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). [[Its]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea‚Äì[[Nauchnij]] in 1974, extending the [[asteroid's]] observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational [[light-curve]] for this asteroid was obtained from [[photometric]] observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory ([[PDO]]), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of [[105]].7¬±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72¬±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=[[0]]). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the [[survey]] [[carried]] out by the [[NEOWISE]] [[mission]] of [[NASA's]] [[Wide-field]] Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid [[measures]] [[4]].[[8]] kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an [[albedo]] of 0.[[28]], while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  [[assumes]] an albedo of 0.30 ‚Äì a compromise [[value]] between [[0]].[[4]] and 0.2, [[corresponding]] to the [[Hungaria]] asteroids as [[family]] and orbital [[group]], [[respectively]] ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of [[4]].6 [[kilometers]], based on an absolute [[magnitude]] of 13.[[7]].

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game.

Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,[[500]] Catalan [[mercenaries]] under Roger de Flor to [[campaign]] against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their [[leader]] Roger [[de]] Flor was [[assassinated]] in Gallipoli on 3 [[April]] 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' [[campaign]] was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,[[∆º00]] Catalan [[mercenari–µs]] under Roger de Flor to [[caÔΩçpaign]] against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their [[leade‚≤Ö]] Roger [[‘Åe]] Flor was [[assassi]] [[nated]] in Gallipoli on 3 [[Aril]] 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' [[caÔΩçpaign]] was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.",5

On 18 occasions he survived being shot down, and he was credited with 220 or 221 aerial victories, around 16 of which were in a Messerschmitt Me-262 jet fighter.

"The 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (4477 TES) was a squadron in the United States Air Force under the claimancy of the Tactical Air Command (TAC). It is currently inactive.

"[[The]] [[Word]] is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. [[The]] supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John [[Medeski]] (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- [[Luther]] [[Dickinson]] (electric guitar), [[Cody]] Dickinson (drums, washboard), and [[ex-North]] Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for [[gospel]] music and the Sacred Steel [[tradition]] shared by Medeski and members of the North [[Mississippi]] Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoolie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a [[song]] [[called]] \""[[Without]] God\"" on the [[Sacred]] Steel [[Live]]! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They [[contacted]] Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel [[band]], likely the first initiated by [[musicians]] outside the House of [[God]] church [[organization]]. [[Musically]], The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both [[gospel]] singing and [[sing-song]] preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the [[original]] church setting. The organ and [[electric]] piano content, provided by [[Medeski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in [[traditional]] [[sacred]] steel music, which [[originally]] developed from House of [[God]] [[churches]] filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less [[expensive]] steel guitar. Another [[unusual]] aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays [[electric]] washboard on [[certain]] songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi [[Allstars]]. [[During]] live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in [[Fort]] Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for [[gospe‚Öº]] music and the Sacred Steel [[tradiùöùion]] shared by Medeski and members of the North [[Mississ—ñppi]] Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoo]] [[lie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a [[—ïong]] [[calle‘Å]] \""[[Withouùöù]] God\"" on the [[Sacre‘Å]] Steel [[Li—µe]]! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They [[contacte‘Å]] Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel [[bad]], likely the first initiated by [[musician—ï]] outside the House of [[Go‘Å]] church [[organizaùöùion]]. [[Musical‚Öºy]], The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both [[gospe‚Öº]] singing and [[—ïing-song]] preaching that often [[accomanies]] such music in the [[origina‚Öº]] church setting. The organ and [[electriœ≤]] piano content, provided by [[Med–µski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in [[traditiona‚Öº]] [[sacre‘Å]] steel music, which [[origin…ëlly]] developed from House of [[Go‘Å]] [[churche—ï]] filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less [[expensi—µe]] steel guitar. Another [[unuusal]] aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays [[electriœ≤]] washboard on [[cerùöùain]] songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi [[Allstar—ï]]. [[Du]] [[ring]] live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in [[Fot]] Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.",0
"[[The]] naval [[Battle]] of the [[Solent]] [[took]] place on [[18]] and 19 [[July]] [[1545]] during the [[Italian]] Wars, fought between the fleets of [[Francis]] I of [[France]] and [[Henry]] [[VIII]] of [[England]], in the [[Solent]] [[channel]] off the [[south]] [[coast]] of [[England]] between Hampshire and the Isle of [[Wight]]. The [[engagement]] was inconclusive and is most [[notable]] for the sinking of the English [[carrack]] [[Mary]] Rose. In [[1545]], [[Francis]] launched an invasion of England with 30,[[000]] soldiers in more than [[200]] ships. [[Against]] this armada ‚Äî [[larger]] than the [[Spanish]] Armada [[forty-three]] [[years]] later ‚Äî the English had about 80 [[ships]] and [[12]],[[000]] soldiers. [[The]] [[French]] [[expedition]] started disastrously, the flagship [[Carraquon]] perishing in an accidental [[fire]] at anchor in the Seine on [[6]] July 1545. Admiral Claude [[d'Annebault]] transferred his flag to La [[Maistresse]] which then ran aground as the [[fleet]] set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. [[The]] French entered the [[Solent]] and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the [[Sussex]] coast. The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch. On [[18]] [[July]] 1545 the [[English]] came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long [[range]], little damage being done on either [[side]]. La [[Maitresse]] was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although [[d'Annebault]] had to change his flagship again she was saved from [[foundering]]. On the night of 18 July Henry [[dined]] aboard Great Harry, the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] John Dudley, [[Viscount]] Lisle. The [[next]] day was calm, and the [[French]] employed their galleys against the immobile [[English]] vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary [[Rose]], the flagship of [[Vice]] Admiral [[George]] Carew, [[advanced]] to [[battle]], she foundered and sank with the loss of all but [[35]]‚Äì[[40]] of her [[crew]]. The [[exact]] reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the [[time]] that the crew had been [[negligent]] and forgot to [[close]] the [[lower]] [[gunports]] after [[firing]] at the galleys, so that when she [[heeled]] over in the breeze she [[took]] on [[water]] and turned over.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[HopatcongÀóSlateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad [[lin–µ]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"[[Dick]] de Groot ([[born]] [[1920]]) was [[born]] in [[Scheveningen]], a beach suburb of [[The]] Hague in the [[Netherlands]].

"[[WCWS-FM]] is the radio station of The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, USA. It is also known as WOO [[91]], Wooster's [[Sound]] Alternative.

Under the [[FCC]] [[Table]] of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, WNZR, also operates at 90.9 MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential. Students [[share]] the administrative duties of running the station with a faculty adviser, currently John Finn, to oversee them. [[Herman]] Gibbs is the chief operator/engineer of WCWS, and has served in that role since 1984.

In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian [[radio]] group, [[challenged]] WCWS and other radio stations during the FCC licence renewal process.
