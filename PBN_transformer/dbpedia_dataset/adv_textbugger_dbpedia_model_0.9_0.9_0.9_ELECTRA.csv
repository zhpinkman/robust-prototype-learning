A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into [[disrep’Ωte]]. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"Augustus [[George]] [[Hazard]] (April [[28]], 1802 ‚Äì May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus [[Hazard]], was an American [[manufacturer]] of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. [[Hazard]] was [[born]] in [[Kingston]], [[Rhode]] Island on April [[28]], [[1802]], a [[son]] of Thomas and [[Silence]] [[Knowles]] [[Hazard]]. His family moved to [[Connecticut]] when he was [[six]] [[years]] [[old]]. [[As]] a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to [[New]] [[York]] [[City]], where he was a commission [[agent]] [[engaged]] in the [[sale]] of [[gunpowder]] and other products. In 1837 he [[bought]] into a gunpowder production [[company]] that had been established two years earlier on the [[Scantic]] River in the [[town]] of [[Enfield]], Connecticut. He assumed [[sole]] ownership of the [[company]] in 1843. The [[business]] was known thereafter as the [[Hazard]] Powder [[Company]] and the village that [[supported]] it became known as [[Hazardville]]. During the early [[years]] of the Civil War, [[Col]]. [[Hazard]] was under suspicion by the federal [[government]] as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was [[well]] [[known]] that he was a [[good]] friend of Confederate President Jefferson [[Davis]], and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina [[seceded]] from the Union, it [[bought]] 80,000 [[lbs]]. of powder that was used to [[propel]] the first shots [[fired]] on Fort Sumter. In fact, [[much]] of the powder in the Southern [[Arsenals]] at the [[outset]] of the [[war]] was manufactured by the [[Connecticut]] [[company]]. The [[rapidly]] increasing demand for [[powder]] [[products]] compelled [[Hazard]] to hurriedly [[expand]] their facilities to [[meet]] [[war]] [[time]] production [[needs]]. Soon Hazard Powder was [[supplying]] the Union Forces with 12,[[500]] [[lbs]] of [[powder]] a day. [[The]] mill at Hazardville was in operation 24 hours a day and produced 40% of all the [[gunpowder]] used during the [[Civil]] [[War]] by the Union.

Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored.

"[[The]] [[Nedbank]] [[Golf]] [[Challenge]], previously known as the Million [[Dollar]] [[Challenge]], is an annual men's professional golf [[tournament]] played at the [[Gary]] [[Player]] [[Country]] Club in Sun City, North [[West]] province, [[South]] Africa.

It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's Open and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest. While playing the 14th hole, Garbacz had her caddie go to a nearby pay phone and order a pizza that she wanted delivered to the 17th tee. The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier.

[[Me…°]] [[Mall–æn]] shot a final round 67 (‚àí4) to finish at 283 (‚àí1), two strokes ahead of runner-up Pat Bradley. Mallon trailed Bradley by three strokes with ten holes to play. It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's Open and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest. While playing the 14th hole, Garbacz had her caddie go to a nearby pay phone and order a pizza that she wanted delivered to the 17th tee. The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In [[1∆∑03]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"The Word is an American instrumental/[[sacred]] steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. [[The]] supergroup includes [[well-known]] musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John [[Medeski]] (keyboards), both members of North [[Mississippi]] [[Allstars-]] Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist [[Chris]] Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North [[Mississippi]] Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoolie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the [[major]] difference being a [[total]] lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that [[often]] accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of [[spiritual]] praise between songs.

"[[The]] Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered [[high-speed]] travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake [[Hopatcong]] in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of [[New]] [[York]] City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction [[near]] the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles ([[18]] km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed [[required]] the movement of millions of [[tons]] of [[fill]] material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cut-Off]] remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the [[Lackawanna's]] 1960 merger with the Erie [[Railroad]] to form the [[Erie]] Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into [[Conrail]] in 1976.

"The 1904‚Äì05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh.

"The [[men's]] [[single]] [[sculls]] competition at the [[2000]] Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[took]] place at the Sydney [[International]] Regatta Centre. [[This]] rowing event is a single scull [[event]], meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" [[portion]] means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for [[singles]] events). The competition consists of [[multiple]] rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking.

The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final.

"The [[Hammersmith]] & City [[line]] of the London Underground runs between Hammersmith and Barking. Coloured salmon pink on the tube map, it serves 29 stations in 15.8 miles (25.5 km). It runs below ground in the central section between Paddington and Bow Road; between Farringdon and Aldgate East it skirts the City of London, the capital's financial heart. The tunnels are just below the surface and are a similar size to those on British main lines. Most of the track and all stations are shared with the District, Circle or Metropolitan lines, the other parts of London Underground's sub-surface railway, and over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year on this line and the Circle line. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway began the world's first underground railway service between Paddington and Farringdon with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The following year, a railway west from Paddington to Hammersmith was opened and this soon became operated and owned jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western railways. The line was then extended to the east, in stages, reaching the East London Railway in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906, and, in 1936, after the Metropolitan Railway had been absorbed by London Passenger Transport Board, some Hammersmith & City trains were extended over the former District Railway line to Barking. The Hammersmith & City route was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, since when it has appeared as a separate line. The track and signalling systems are being upgraded, and the old 6-car C Stock trains have been replaced by new 7-car S Stock trains in a programme to increase capacity by 65 per cent by 2019.

"The [[Journal]] of Economic Education (JEE) offers original peer-reviewed articles on teaching economics. The inaugural issue appeared in the fall of 1969. At the time, G.L. Bach (Stanford University) wrote in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings (1971) that the JEE was to be the forum for scholarly work in economic education, primarily at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities, but including junior colleges and, to some extent, the high schools. In the early days, the Council for Economic Education (then call the Joint Council and later the National Council) oversaw publication of the JEE, and members of the American Economic Association Committee on Economic Education served as the editorial board, with Henry Villard (City University of New York) serving as editor.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

"[[The]] Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late [[15th-century]] morality [[play]]. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.","[[Te]] Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late [[15thÀócentury]] morality [[paly]].
