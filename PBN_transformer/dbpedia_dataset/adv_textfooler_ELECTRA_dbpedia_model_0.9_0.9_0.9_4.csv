"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest point of [[land]] in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated 693 [[m]] (2,274 [[ft]]) above [[sea]] [[level]]. Ishpatina Ridge [[rises]] [[approximately]] 300 [[m]] (984 [[ft]]) above the [[immediate]] [[area]]. [[It]] was only [[truly]] recognized as Ontario's [[highest]] [[point]] after [[federal]] [[government]] topographical [[mapping]] [[revealed]] this [[fact]] in the 1970s. Before then, the more [[popular]] Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The [[ridge]] lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater [[Provincial]] [[Park]]. Due to its [[remote]] [[location]], Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is a challenge to reach. The [[closest]] [[major]] [[highway]], [[Highway]] 560, is more than 30 km [[north]]. There are a [[few]] logging roads and [[trails]] in the remote [[area]], but they are [[difficult]] to [[travel]] in poor weather. The most [[popular]] [[approach]] [[route]] to Ishpatina is by [[canoe]]/[[portage]] [[via]] a [[logging]] road to the south out of the [[town]] of Capreol [[north]] of [[Sudbury]]. [[While]] a northern [[route]] [[exists]] (out of Gowganda, the [[nearest]] [[community]]), there are [[numerous]] portages [[making]] it [[particularly]] onerous. [[This]] [[route]] [[has]] traditionally been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by [[ski]]/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a [[fire]] [[tower]] atop the [[ridge]] was [[staffed]] by [[forest]] [[workers]] and they would have been [[ferried]] to the [[site]] by float [[plane]]. The [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" [[comes]] from an Ojibwe [[language]] [[word]] ishpadinaa, meaning \""[[high]] [[place]]/[[ridge]]\"". The [[city]] of Ishpeming, [[Michigan]], in [[Marquette]] [[County]], and Spadina [[Avenue]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario [[derive]] their [[names]] from the same [[word]]. [[Although]] the Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] in [[Ontario]], at least one other [[geographic]] [[feature]], [[Maple]] [[Mountain]] (approximately 25 [[km]] to the [[east]]) [[has]] greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) [[higher]] than Ishpatina Ridge's [[rise]] over Scarecrow [[Lake]]. An [[abandoned]] firetower, [[often]] [[referred]] to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is [[still]] [[standing]] on the [[highest]] section of the [[Ridge]] ([[left]]). The [[original]] [[tower]] was an 80 ft [[structure]] [[erected]] in 1930. The successor, [[currently]] [[standing]], is 100 ft [[high]] and was [[abandoned]] in the 1960s. The towerman would [[have]] [[resided]] in a [[cabin]] on the [[shore]] of Scarecrow [[Lake]] and would have hiked a 3.5 [[km]] [[trail]] daily [[taking]] [[approximately]] [[two]] [[hours]] to [[summit]] and a [[little]] over one hour to descend again. [[Located]] between [[Tower]] [[Peak]] and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the [[deepest]] in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the [[canyon]] hides the fact.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[Frederick]] Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 [[July]] 1894 – [[November]] 1972) was a [[Welsh]] professional [[footballer]] and [[Wales]] international.

[[Overcoming]] doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released.
