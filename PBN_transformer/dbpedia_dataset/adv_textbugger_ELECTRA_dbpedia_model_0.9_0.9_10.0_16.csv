"On [[20]] [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club [[faced]] [[Arsenal]] Football [[Club]] in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"The 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was held on Sunday, 22 May [[2011]], to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias. At stake were all 45 seats in the General Junta, determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist [[Workers']] Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. The FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco √Ålvarez Cascos, former Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as PP's candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an [[American]] 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief [[architect]] for Eastern College.

Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored.

"[[The]] [[Grand]] Rapids Hotel also [[known]] as the The [[Grand]] Rapids [[Resort]], was a [[hotel]] that existed outside of [[Mount]] Carmel, Illinois in [[Wabash]] County, Illinois, United States in [[Southern]] Illinois from [[1922]] to [[1929]].

"Perfect [[Records]] was a United States-based record [[label]] founded in [[1922]] by Path√© [[Records]] to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92‚Äì87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league. The team finished the 1978‚Äì79 season with a record of 11 wins and 23 losses, placing them in fourth and last place in the Midwest Division. In the Midwestern Division for the 1979‚Äì80 season, the Does finished with a record of 11 wins and 24 losses.

Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Ba—ïketball]] League.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronicus]] II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a [[two-year]] pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor [[Anronicus]] II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor.

"[[Martin]] [[Bruce]] [[Cameron]] ([[born]] [[24]] August [[1936]]), [[Australian]] [[politician]], was a [[member]] of the [[Australian]] Senate and the [[South]] [[Australian]] [[Legislative]] Council. In 1968 Cameron [[contested]] the safe Labor [[House]] of [[Assembly]] [[seat]] of [[Millicent]] for the [[Liberal]] and [[Country]] League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent [[Des]] Corcoran on [[road]] [[transport]] control. Cameron [[gained]] a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the [[Court]] of Disputed Returns, which ordered a [[by-election]]. [[Corcoran]] comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, [[Senator]] [[Keith]] [[Laught]] died [[suddenly]] and Cameron was [[nominated]] by [[Premier]] Steele Hall as his replacement. However, [[Cameron's]] time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the [[vacancy]] was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by [[Labor's]] Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron [[entered]] South [[Australia's]] Legislative Council in [[1971]] following the [[retirement]] of [[Sir]] Norman Jude. He [[became]] an [[important]] ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), [[representing]] the increasingly visible [[moderate]] [[forces]] [[within]] the [[party]]. Cameron often [[opposed]] his fellow [[LCL]] Legislative Councillors, [[due]] to his [[support]] for Universal Suffrage for that [[chamber]]. This [[tension]] within the [[LCL]] led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. [[Led]] by [[Hall]] and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally functioned as a faction within the [[LCL]]. Cameron was one of its most prominent [[supporters]]. After the 1973 [[Election]], the LCL (led at this stage by [[Bruce]] Eastick) [[expelled]] the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement members, such as [[future]] Premiers David [[Tonkin]] and Dean Brown, decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron left with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the [[Legislative]] Council until the [[1975]] Election when he was joined by John [[Carnie]]. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the LCL (renamed the Liberal Party of Australia in 1974), and there was a push from within both parties for [[reunification]]. In [[1976]] Cameron and Hall rejoined the Liberal Party, while Millhouse initially [[formed]] the [[New]] LM before [[helping]] found the Australian Democrats. [[Despite]] not serving in the Tonkin [[ministry]], [[Cameron]] assumed the [[position]] of Leader of the Opposition in the [[Legislative]] [[Council]] after the election of the [[John]] Bannon [[Labor]] government at the [[1982]] Elections. He [[held]] this [[position]] until his retirement from politics in [[1990]]. [[Following]] his retirement from the [[Council]], [[Cameron]] served a term as [[president]] of the [[South]] Australian [[branch]] of the [[Liberal]] Party. [[Later]], he [[became]] a [[vocal]] supporter of the 'yes' case in the 1999 republic referendum.","[[Marùöùin]] [[Bruœ≤e]] [[Came‚≤Öon]] ([[bo‚≤Ön]] [[2·èé]] August [[1‡ß≠36]]), [[Austra‚Öºian]] [[poliùöùician]], was a [[membe‚≤Ö]] of the [[Austra‚Öºian]] Senate and the [[Souùöùh]] [[Austra‚Öºian]] [[Legislati—µe]] Council.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song [[played]] by The Word, on [[January]] 1, [[2010]] in Fort Lauderdale, [[Florida]]. Their [[debut]] self-titled album, [[produced]] by Medeski and [[released]] on Ropeadope [[Records]] July [[31]], 2001, [[includes]] an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album [[contains]] a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the [[group]]. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

[[The]] [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a [[sixteen-year-old]] high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and [[enters]] junior [[high]], he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having [[sex]] with a man in his dream.

"The [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates.

"[[Frederick]] Charles 'Fred' [[Keenor]] ([[31]] July [[1894]] ‚Äì November 1972) was a [[Welsh]] professional footballer and [[Wales]] [[international]]. He began his career at his [[hometown]] [[club]] Cardiff City after impressing in a [[trial]] match in 1912 that was organised by his [[former]] schoolteacher. A [[hard-tackling]] Defender, he [[appeared]] sporadically for the team in the Southern [[Football]] League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) [[Battalion]], [[Middlesex]] Regiment, which [[became]] known as the [[Football]] Battalion, led by [[Major]] Frank [[Buckley]]. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe [[shrapnel]] wound to his thigh in 1916. After [[lengthy]] rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a [[fitness]] [[instructor]], reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his [[shrapnel]] wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in [[1925]], suffering a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1‚Äì0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team [[based]] outside [[England's]] borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930‚Äì31 season, when he was released.

"The men's [[single]] sculls [[competition]] at the 2000 Summer [[Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], Australia [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta [[Centre]].

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders.

On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast.

It also upheld New Zealand's national interests of countering communism in South-East Asia.

[[T]] [[his]] [[conflicùöù]] was also the first in which New Zealand did not fight alongside the United Kingdom, instead following the loyalties of the ANZUS Pact. New Zealand decided to send troops to Vietnam in 1965 because of Cold War concerns and alliance considerations. The potential adverse effect on the ANZUS alliance of not supporting the United States (and Australia) in Vietnam was key. It also upheld New Zealand's national interests of countering communism in South-East Asia. The government wanted to maintain solidarity with the United States, but was unsure about the likely outcome of external military intervention in Vietnam.

"[[Shore]] [[Line]] East (SLE) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut, US.

Connecting service west of New Haven to New York City is available via Metro-North [[Railroad's]] New Haven Line.

The Pimlico Special was first [[r’Ωn]] in 1937 and was won by that year's U.S. [[Tr—ñple]] [[Cro‘ùn]] [[winne‚≤Ö]] War Admiral who [[wenùöù]] on to be voted the American Horse of the Year. In 1938, the Pimlico Special was host to one of American racing's historic moments when Seabiscuit defeated War Admiral in a much anticipated match race. That race was covered by almost every major newspaper, magazine and radio station of the time. Discontinued after 1958, the race was revived as a handicap event in 1988 and made a graded stakes race one year later in 1989. The race was not eligible for grading in 2011 because it had not been run the previous two years. Eighteen Pimlico Special winners have gone on to win a Championship for Horse of the Year or an Eclipse Award as the best horse in their divisions. The latest was Invasor in 2006; others include Mineshaft, Real Quiet, Skip Away, Cigar, Criminal Type, Blushing John, Tom Fool, Capot, Citation, Assault, Armed, Twilight Tear, Whirlaway, Market Wise, Challedon, Seabiscuit and War Admiral.

"No. 51 [[Squadron]] RAF [[Regiment]] is a [[field]] [[squadron]] of the [[RAF]] [[Regiment]] in the [[Royal]] Air [[Force]]. [[Its]] [[mission]] is [[protection]] of RAF [[bases]] from [[ground]] attack. The [[history]] of No. 51 Squadron [[goes]] back to 1947 when it was [[formed]] at [[RAF]] Celle near the [[L√ºneburg]] Heath in [[Germany]] by the [[redesignation]] of No. [[2713]] Squadron RAF Regiment. [[Its]] initial [[role]] was as a [[rifle]] squadron, [[protecting]] RAF [[facilities]] from ground attack. In [[1955]] it [[changed]] to the [[light]] anti-aircraft role which it retained until disbanded in [[1957]]. In 1964 the squadron reformed, switching back to the rifle [[role]], at the RAF Regiment Depot. [[The]] first assignments of the unit after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook [[internal]] [[security]] roles. [[After]] Rhodesia unilaterally [[declared]] [[independence]] in [[1965]] it was sent to Africa to [[protect]] Gloster [[Javelin]] aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. [[After]] returning to Catterick the unit's [[next]] deployment was [[back]] to Aden in the immediate period before the [[British]] withdrawal from there in 1967. Its service in Aden was [[mainly]] spent at the many isolated airfields dotting that [[colony]]. In 1968 the squadron shifted [[bases]] with a move to [[RAF]] Wittering. [[This]] [[move]] was undertaken to support the [[Hawker]] [[Siddeley]] [[Harrier]] force which was then [[becoming]] operational. With the start of the [[troubles]] in Northern Ireland in [[1969]], No. [[51]] Squadron deployed to the province, a process which it would repeat at [[regular]] intervals for the next 18 years. [[This]] [[period]] also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and Hong Kong. In 1982 the squadron moved back to Catterick from Wittering to [[re-role]]. It [[emerged]] [[operating]] the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked) family and in wartime it would have [[moved]] to Germany to defend airfields there. However its next war [[service]] was not to be in [[Europe]] but in the [[Middle]] East. In aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] the squadron deployed to [[Arabia]] and detachments saw service at Dharan, Muharraq and Tabuk during the war. [[Following]] the Options for Change defence cuts the squadron was disbanded in [[1993]]. [[The]] dawn of a new century saw a return to active service for the squadron. Once again operating in a [[field]] squadron role, it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before moving to RAF Lossiemouth. It was not long before war [[beckoned]] again and the squadron was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. [[Following]] the invasion it has taken [[part]] in roulements back to the region.

"U.S. [[Route]] 1 (US 1) is a [[United]] [[States]] [[highway]] which parallels the East [[Coast]] of the United States, running from [[Key]] West, [[Florida]] in the south to Fort Kent, Maine at the Canadian border in the [[north]]. Of the entire length of the [[route]], 66.06 miles ([[106]].31 km) of it runs through [[New]] Jersey. It enters the state from Pennsylvania on the Trenton‚ÄìMorrisville Toll [[Bridge]] over the Delaware River in the state capital of Trenton, running through the city on the Trenton Freeway. [[From]] here, US [[1]] continues northeast as a [[surface]] [[divided]] [[highway]] through [[suburban]] [[areas]] continuing into Middlesex County and [[passing]] through New [[Brunswick]] and [[Edison]]. US [[1]] merges with US [[9]] in [[Woodbridge]], and the [[two]] routes continue through northern [[New]] Jersey as US [[1]]/9 to the George [[Washington]] [[Bridge]] over the Hudson River in Fort [[Lee]]. At this point, the road [[continues]] into [[New]] York City [[along]] with [[I-95]]. [[The]] [[current]] alignment of US [[1]] between [[Trenton]] and [[New]] Brunswick was chartered as the Trenton and [[New]] [[Brunswick]] [[Turnpike]] in 1803 and [[struggled]] throughout its [[100-year]] existence. In [[1913]], the Lincoln [[Highway]] across the [[United]] States was [[created]] and connected Trenton to [[Newark]] within [[New]] Jersey. [[The]] [[Lincoln]] [[Highway]] was legislated as Route 13 between Trenton and [[New]] Brunswick in 1917 and as part of Route [[1]] between [[New]] [[Brunswick]] and Elizabeth, [[later]] [[extended]] to Jersey [[City]]. [[With]] the [[creation]] of the U.S. [[Highway]] System in 1926, US 1 was [[designated]] to follow the Lincoln Highway between Trenton and Newark and the current alignment of US [[1]]/[[9]] Truck to [[Jersey]] City, where it continued to the Holland Tunnel. In [[1927]], the Lincoln Highway [[portion]] of US 1 [[became]] [[Route]] [[27]]. [[The]] current alignment of US 1 between Trenton and Newark was [[legislated]] as Route 26, Route [[S26]] and Route 25, while the current [[route]] north from Jersey [[City]] to the [[George]] [[Washington]] [[Bridge]] became [[Route]] 1 and [[Route]] [[6]]. In subsequent years, US 1 was moved [[onto]] its current routing between Trenton and the [[George]] Washington Bridge. The state highways [[running]] concurrent with US 1 were removed in [[1953]], around the same [[time]] the route was moved to the Trenton Freeway [[within]] Trenton and the old alignment became US 1 Alternate, part of which is now US 1 [[Business]].

"The [[Action]] of 15 February 1783 was a small naval [[engagement]] which was [[fought]] off Guadeloupe between the French Navy frigate Concorde of 36 guns and the Royal Navy 74-gun ship of the line Magnificent. The British were victorious when Concorde was overhauled and captured. Captain Charles Inglis was given command of a squadron of four ships cruising independently in the West Indies. The squadron, consisting of HMS St Albans, the 64-gun Prudent, the 74-gun HMS Magnificent under Captain Robert Linzee and the sloop HMS Barbados, had arrived in St. Lucia. They were to eventually help blockade Cap-Fran√ßois off Saint-Domingue with the help of ships of the line from the Jamaica station. On 12 February reports arrived of a French squadron, consisting of Triton, Amphion and several frigates, having sailed from Martinique and so the squadron was sent to investigate. Magnificent sailed from Gros Islet Bay in Bay on 12 February 1783 in company with Prudent and St Albans. On 15 February 1783 a French frigate was sighted just past Guadeloupe island by Magnificent. The frigate was the Concorde carrying 36 guns and 300 men, and was under the command of Chevalier du Clesmaur.

"Jerry [[Allen]] [[Walker]] ([[born]] February 12, 1939 in [[Ada]], Oklahoma) is a former [[right-handed]] pitcher in American [[Major]] League Baseball who performed for the Baltimore [[Orioles]], Kansas [[City]] Athletics and [[Cleveland]] Indians between 1957 and 1964. During his career, he stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 195 pounds (88 kg). He signed with Baltimore as a \""[[bonus]] baby\"" out of [[Ada's]] [[Byng]] High School on June 28, 1957. A member of the [[Orioles']] fabled \""[[Kiddie]] Corps\"" of young pitchers signed in the late 1950s (others included [[Milt]] [[Pappas]], Steve Barber and Chuck Estrada), Walker is one of a very few players to have gone straight to the Major [[Leagues]] without ever [[playing]] a game in the minor [[leagues]]. In his [[debut]], on July 6, [[1957]], against the Boston [[Red]] Sox, he failed to retire a batter, [[issuing]] bases on balls to Mickey Vernon and Jackie Jensen, then [[uncorking]] a wild pitch. Walker then was lifted from the game, but both runners scored, giving Walker an earned [[run]] average of infinity coming out of his first MLB game. However, he was consistently more effective as the season progressed, and threw a [[four-hit]], complete game [[shutout]] against the Washington Senators on September 4, beating [[Camilo]] Pascual 1‚Äì0 for his first [[big-league]] [[victory]]. He also became the [[youngest]] pitcher [[ever]] to start a [[Major]] League Baseball All-Star game when, at age 20, he went to mound for the American League in the second All-Star contest of 1959. [[Walker]] went three innings and allowed one run on two hits and one base on balls, and was credited with the win in a 5‚Äì[[3]] AL victory at Los [[Angeles]] [[Memorial]] Coliseum. Later that season, on [[September]] 11, [[1959]], he hurled a [[16-inning]], complete game [[shutout]] against the eventual league [[champion]] Chicago White Sox, winning [[1]]‚Äì[[0]]. It was his 11th and final [[win]] of the 1959 season, his most successful campaign in the big [[leagues]]. By [[age]] [[26]], however, Walker was out of the [[Majors]]. In 190 games pitched, 90 as a starter, he allowed 734 [[hits]] and 341 bases on balls over [[747]] innings. He had 326 [[strikeouts]], 16 complete games, [[four]] [[shutouts]] and 13 saves. Walker's active career ended in [[1967]] in the [[Double-A]] Eastern League. He has maintained his [[involvement]] in organized baseball as a minor [[league]] manager, big-league pitching [[coach]], scout and [[front-office]] [[executive]]. He served one season (1993) as the general manager of the Detroit Tigers. From 1995 through 2007, he was the vice president and director of player personnel in the front [[office]] of the St. Louis Cardinals, working as a key assistant to then-GM Walt Jocketty.

[[Banners]] commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project.

"The Whitlam Government refers to the federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. It was made up of members of the Australian Labor Party. The government commenced when it defeated the McMahon Government in the 1972 federal election after a record 23 [[years]] of Coalition government. It concluded in historic circumstances, when it was dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr as a result of the 1975 constitutional crisis and was succeeded by the Fraser Government. The Whitlam Government remains the only federal government in Australian history to be dismissed by an either a monarch or viceregal representative. The Whitlam Government, while highly controversial during its short tenure, is credited with the implementation of major reforms. Formal relations with China were established, the conscription laws were repealed, all remaining Australian forces were withdrawn from the Vietnam War, and tertiary education fees were abolished. The Whitlam Government was re-elected in the 1974 federal election.

"Canby Area [[Transit]], or simply CAT, is the public transit bus [[service]] provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon. As of 2015, it operates one fixed route between Woodburn, Canby and Oregon City along Oregon Route 99E, complementary paratransit, and a dial-a-ride service within the city of Canby. It has a hub at the downtown Canby Transit Center. CAT was established as a department of the City of Canby on January 1, 2002 upon Canby's withdrawal from the TriMet service area, and had an official dedication on August 20, 2002. Canby paid TriMet to continue service in the interim, and replaced TriMet's commuter runs in 2004, which received little ridership at the end. CAT also expanded service within the city of Canby, to Woodburn and to Wilsonville, the latter in partnership with Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit. Canby replaced TriMet's payroll tax with its own within the city, but at a somewhat lower rate, and also receives state and federal grants. Due to the loss of state tax credits and recession-caused tax revenue decreases, CAT had to eliminate Saturday service, fixed-route service within Canby and trips to Wilsonville, as well as started charging a $1 fare. In exchange, they started to allow the general public to use dial-a-ride service within Canby that was previously limited to eligible disabled riders, and SMART continued to operate its trips from Wilsonville.","Canby Area [[Tra’∏sit]], or simply CAT, is the public transit bus [[—ïervice]] provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

"The Velvet Underground was an American rock [[band]] from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967.
