"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a [[prior]] of the Carthusian [[Grand]] Chartreuse and [[bishop]] of Belley. [[He]] was [[born]] [[near]] Chambéry in 1107. [[He]] would later [[receive]] an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to [[become]] a Carthusian [[monk]] at Portes. Only two [[years]] after [[joining]] the [[order]], he was [[made]] the [[prior]] of the [[Grande]] Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his [[order]], which [[had]] [[recently]] [[incurred]] [[substantial]] [[damage]]. [[He]] was an [[effective]] [[administrator]] there. [[While]] under his [[direction]], the community [[increased]] in [[numbers]] and fervency. [[He]] [[restored]] and [[improved]] the [[buildings]], [[including]] [[constructing]] a defensive [[wall]] and an [[aqueduct]]. The [[rules]] of the [[order]] were [[standardized]], and [[changed]] to [[allow]] [[women]] the [[opportunity]] to [[enter]] the [[order]] in their [[own]] [[houses]]. [[He]] also [[brought]] the other [[houses]] of the [[order]] into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The [[monks]] under his [[direction]] [[included]] [[Hugh]] of Lincoln, who [[expressed]] [[great]] [[fondness]] for Anthelm. Anthelm [[continued]] in his [[office]] almost [[constantly]] for twenty-four [[years]], [[barring]] a [[period]] of a [[few]] [[years]] when he was a hermit. [[After]] that [[period]], in 1152, Anthelm [[returned]] to the Grand Chartreuse, and [[helped]] [[defend]] the sitting Pope Alexander III against the antipope Victor IV. Alexander III appointed Anthelm bishop of Belley in 1163. In that [[position]], he is said to [[have]] been [[fearless]] and uncompromising, [[working]] to [[reform]] the [[clergy]] and [[regulate]] the [[affairs]] of the diocese. One [[example]] of his [[fearlessness]] [[occurred]] in 1175, when Anthelm excommunicated [[Count]] Humbert of Maurienne for [[having]] [[taken]] one [[priest]] [[captive]] and [[murdering]] another [[priest]] who had [[tried]] to [[free]] him. Humbert [[appealed]] his [[excommunication]] to [[Pope]] [[Alexander]] [[III]], who reversed Humbert's [[excommunication]]. Anthelm, who believed that Humbert was not [[penitent]] for his [[misconduct]], withdrew from his diocese in protest. [[Pope]] [[Alexander]] then [[commissioned]] Anthelm to [[travel]] to [[England]] to [[try]] to reconcile [[Henry]] [[II]] of England and [[Thomas]] Becket. Anthelm's [[health]] was such that he was [[unable]] to [[take]] the journey. Anthelm returned to Belley to help care for the poor and the [[lepers]] of the area. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178.

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[voters]] were [[organized]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
