"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"Perfect Records was a United States-based record [[label]] founded in 1922 by Pathé Records to [[produce]] [[cheap]] 78 rpm discs.

This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up [[ponographs]] of the day. [[Theiⲅ]] slogan on the record [[sleeѵe]] was \""Better [[recordѕ]] [[can'𝚝]] be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill [[Bronozy]], Cab [[Callowaу]], Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area [[orchestraѕ]] and studio groups of the [[ԁay]]. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect [[labelѕ]] were part of the merger that created the American [[Recorԁ]] Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling [[labelѕ]] (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper [[labelѕ]] in late 1938. [[Te]] [[labeⅼ]] was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings [[presseԁ]] on 78 [[ⲅ]].[[р]].m. vinyl by [[Sսn]] [[Ci𝚝y]] [[Girlѕ]], [[Charⅼie]] [[Featհers]], Junior [[KimЬrough]], The [[Bɑlfa]] [[Brotherѕ]], and [[Jon]] [[Fahеy]].",0

"[[The]] Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the [[Delaware]], Lackawanna & [[Western]] Railroad (DL&W) between [[1908]] and 1911. When it [[opened]] on [[December]] [[24]], [[1911]], the Cut-Off was [[considered]] a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] [[rail]] [[line]], [[built]] upon [[large]] cuts and fills, and which [[included]] [[two]] [[large]] [[concrete]] viaducts that [[allowed]] for what was considered high-speed [[travel]] at that time. [[The]] [[line]] was [[part]] of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, [[New]] [[York]]. [[The]] Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles ([[45]].9 km) from Port [[Morris]] Junction — near the south end of [[Lake]] Hopatcong in [[New]] Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New [[York]] City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water [[Gap]] in Pennsylvania.

[[Born]] in [[Blackstock]], Ontario near [[Port]] [[Perry]], [[Bruce]] was [[educated]] as a [[surgeon]] at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. He [[owned]] [[Wellesley]] Hospital in [[Toronto]] which he [[founded]] in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of [[surgery]] at the University of Toronto. In [[1916]], during [[World]] [[War]] I, he was [[appointed]] [[inspector-general]] of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by [[Sir]] [[Sam]] Hughes, and [[attained]] the [[rank]] of colonel in the Canadian Army ([[Permanent]] [[Active]] Militia). Bruce [[investigated]] [[medical]] [[practices]] in the [[army]] and issued a [[Report]] on the Canadian Army [[Medical]] [[Service]] which urged a [[complete]] reorganization of the [[medical]] corps. [[Few]] of his [[recommendations]] for general reorganization were [[immediately]] feasible from the [[military]] and economic points-of-view, and the [[manner]] of his [[appointment]] was protested by [[Sir]] William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was [[disowned]] by the [[government]] at the [[time]] and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his conservative patron, [[Hughes]], was [[obliged]] to resign. In [[1919]], Bruce [[published]] Politics and the Canadian [[Army]] [[Medical]] [[Corps]], criticizing the [[government]] for its [[actions]] but [[avoiding]] any specific denunciation of [[Hughes]]. [[Later]] in the [[war]], as [[surgical]] [[consultant]] to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some [[useful]] reforms in [[surgical]] [[management]], [[including]] greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and [[operating]] [[room]] technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce [[purchased]] a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and [[built]] a [[Tudor-style]] [[mansion]] which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until [[1937]]. He [[often]] verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great [[Depression]]. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most [[lieutenant-governors]] are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the [[King's]] representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP [[David]] Spence in the middle of the [[1940]] federal election [[campaign]], Bruce contested and won [[Spence's]] seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

Following the sudden death of Conservative MP [[Daviԁ]] Spence in the middle of the [[19Ꮞ0]] federal election [[cɑmpaign]], Bruce contested and won [[Spece's]] seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.",0

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

"[[Nikolas]] Cassadine is a fictional [[character]] from [[General]] Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network. Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a [[recurring]] basis in honor of the soaps' fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular.

Hailed by [[Soap]] Opera Digest as the \""Best New Male Character\"" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the supercouple of Luke and Laura's happy life with their children, Lucky and Lulu. Luke immediately despises Nikolas due to his Cassadine heritage despite Nikolas saving an ailing Lulu's life. The misunderstood Nikolas is forced to grow up when his paternity comes into question and he is led to believe that his uncle Stefan is his father, as opposed to the late Stavros. Nikolas spends majority of his life trying to get out from under his family's treachery and become his own man. In addition to other romances, Nikolas is most known for his widely popular romance with Emily Quartermaine. Nikolas also has a son, Spencer named in honor of the Spencer family. The [[character]] was written out in 2011 following his disastrous affair with Lucky's longtime love, Elizabeth Webber. The [[character's]] 2013 return features the return of his biological father Stavros, and the ending of the war between the Cassadine and Spencer families.

Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal.

These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place.

"The Raving Loony Green Giant Party was a [[political]] party in the [[United]] Kingdom. It was [[founded]] in [[1989]] by former members of the Official Monster Raving [[Loony]] Party (OMRLP) after clashes between them and other members of the party over direction and party activities – in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood [[candidates]] in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the [[Ribble]] Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP [[candidates']] campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to [[Sidmouth]] Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, [[representing]] the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a [[councilor]] on Johnstone Community Council in [[Scotland]], who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the OMRLP – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine [[membership]] of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. [[The]] [[party]] became [[effectively]] defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the [[OMRLP]].

[[The]] [[line]] has at various stages been [[proposed]] as a automated [[people]] [[mover]], [[tram-train]], tramway, light [[rail]], stadtbahn, rapid [[transit]], bus [[rapid]] [[transit]] and commuter rail. The current [[proposal]] consists of a metro [[line]] starting at [[Majorstuen]] [[Station]] and running entirely in a [[tunnel]] for 8,150 meters (26,740 [[ft]]).

The [[history]] of No. 51 Squadron goes back to 1947 when it was [[formed]] at [[RAF]] Celle near the Lüneburg [[Heath]] in Germany by the redesignation of No. [[2713]] Squadron [[RAF]] [[Regiment]]. Its initial role was as a rifle [[squadron]], protecting RAF [[facilities]] from [[ground]] attack. In [[1955]] it changed to the light anti-aircraft role which it retained until [[disbanded]] in 1957. In [[1964]] the [[squadron]] [[reformed]], switching back to the rifle role, at the [[RAF]] Regiment Depot. The first assignments of the [[unit]] after [[reforming]] were [[overseas]] to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook [[internal]] security [[roles]]. After [[Rhodesia]] [[unilaterally]] declared [[independence]] in 1965 it was [[sent]] to Africa to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were deployed in [[Zambia]]. After returning to Catterick the [[unit's]] next deployment was back to Aden in the immediate period before the British withdrawal from there in 1967. Its service in [[Aden]] was mainly spent at the many [[isolated]] airfields dotting that [[colony]]. In 1968 the [[squadron]] shifted bases with a [[move]] to [[RAF]] Wittering. This move was undertaken to [[support]] the [[Hawker]] Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming operational. [[With]] the start of the [[troubles]] in Northern [[Ireland]] in [[1969]], No. [[51]] Squadron deployed to the [[province]], a process which it would repeat at regular intervals for the next 18 [[years]]. [[This]] period also saw [[deployments]] to RAF [[Salalah]] and Hong Kong. In 1982 the [[squadron]] moved back to [[Catterick]] from Wittering to [[re-role]]. [[It]] emerged [[operating]] the Combat [[Vehicle]] [[Reconnaissance]] (tracked) family and in [[wartime]] it would have moved to [[Germany]] to defend [[airfields]] there. However its next war service was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. In aftermath of the Iraqi [[invasion]] of Kuwait the squadron deployed to [[Arabia]] and [[detachments]] saw service at Dharan, Muharraq and Tabuk during the [[war]]. Following the Options for Change defence [[cuts]] the [[squadron]] was [[disbanded]] in 1993. The dawn of a new century saw a [[return]] to active service for the squadron. [[Once]] again operating in a [[field]] squadron role, it reformed at RAF [[Honington]] in [[2001]] before [[moving]] to [[RAF]] Lossiemouth. It was not [[long]] before war beckoned again and the [[squadron]] was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. [[Following]] the invasion it has taken [[part]] in roulements back to the [[region]]. [[Most]] [[recently]], 20 personnel from the Regiment [[deployed]] in [[support]] of Operation Shader.","No. 51 [[Squadr]] [[on]] RAF Regiment is a field [[squa]] [[dron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air Force.

AOE were a commercially successful Canadian rock band of the [[mid-90s]]. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995. In 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with their side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \""Remote Control\"", which peaked at No. 9 on Canada's Singles Chart and was later featured on MuchMusic's diamond certified compilation [[album]], Big Shiny Tunes 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace. Upon the break-up of Age of Electric, the brothers Kerns would go on to form Static in Stereo with other members including their brother Ryan. Kurt Dahle went on to work with The New Pornographers.

"Miles \""Milco\"" [[Copeland]] is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Josh Quong Tart. He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007. Ryley Mickle and Jackson Edwards played Miles in flashback sequences, showing him at ages three and eight years old respectively. During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as [[regular]] character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits. Miles' storylines have often centred on his friendships and romantic relationships with other characters. He has become a surrogate father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her. Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three [[Inside]] Soap Awards.","Miles \""Milco\"" [[Copelanԁ]] is a [[f]] [[ictional]] [[characteⲅ]] from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Josh Quong Tart.

"St Reims ([[foaled]] 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[racehorse]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002. A million-dollar yearling, big things were always expected of the son of Zabeel, and although he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon started to live up to expectations. A runaway win in the Avondale Guineas at his last start before the Derby ensured that he would start favourite in the Classic, and he didn't disappoint.

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky.

On 27 June 2013, the Australian Electoral Commission approved a change in the spelling of the [[pɑrty's]] name from \""[[Democratiϲ]] Labor [[Par𝚝y]]\"" to \""[[Democratiϲ]] Labour Party\""—with the party stating that the change [[reflecteԁ]] the \""[[correc𝚝]] Australian spelling\"" of the word 'labour', and also differentiated it from the [[Austraⅼian]] Labor Party. On 23 April 2015 the [[par𝚝y]] was [[dеregistered]] by the Australian Electoral Commission for 'failure to demonstrate requisite 500 members to [[ｍaintain]] registration'. On 1 March 2016, the Australian Electoral commission upheld an appeal by the DLP against its [[dereɡistration]] and reregistered it. The [[D]] [[LP]] has proven it has at least 500 members in Victoria alone and is [[reg]] [[istered]] with the Victorian Electoral Commission.",0
"The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a [[nationalist]] political party in Northern Ireland, [[founded]] in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). The [[party]] was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. [[It]] was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. The [[party]] first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. Its best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, leaving the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early 1980s. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for [[example]] in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate [[nationalists]] had remained with the [[SDLP]]. The [[party]] [[remained]] [[active]] until at least [[1985]], when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been [[disbanded]] before the next local elections in 1989.","The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a [[nationalіst]] political party in Northern Ireland, [[foundeԁ]] in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).

In his first [[year]] at Emmerdale he was [[simply]] a nice but [[naive]] character, but come 1994, his life in the Dales would take a turn for the worse. On 9 August 1994, the Dingle family arrived in Emmerdale, and on that very night during a rave, Ben Dingle started a fight with Luke, during which Ben inexplicably died. The rest of the Dingles believed that Ben had been murdered and proceeded to make Luke's life a living hell. It eventually emerged, however, that Ben was suffering from a heart defect. The Dingles refused to believe this however, theorising that the McAllisters had managed to hide evidence, considering that one of the doctors who examined Ben's body was Luke's father.

It first appeared under the title The [[Unspeakable]] Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the English Cyclops. When that [[magazine]] [[ceased]] [[publication]], [[Burroughs]] and [[Mc]] [[Neill]] [[decided]] to [[develop]] the [[concept]] as a book. [[After]] a year of [[research]] and [[preliminary]] design the text of the book had [[expanded]] from 11 [[pages]] to [[50]], and a [[complete]] mockup had been [[produced]]. By this [[point]], the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death [[God]]. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco [[agreed]] to [[publish]] the proposed work in 1971 as a \""[[Word]]/Image novel\"" which was to comprise 120 pages, some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which [[featured]] only pictures. In [[1973]], [[Mc]] [[Neill]] moved to San [[Francisco]] from London to [[finish]] the project. [[However]], the [[small]] [[advance]] proffered by the [[publisher]] [[made]] any more than a few months of working full-time on the project impossible, and when [[Straight]] [[Arrow]] closed in [[1974]] the [[book]] was [[without]] a [[publisher]]. [[Nevertheless]], [[Mc]] [[Neill]] moved to [[New]] [[York]] in [[1975]] to [[rejoin]] Burroughs and continue the work. They were [[unable]] to [[find]] [[another]] [[publisher]] and after [[seven]] years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was subsequently [[published]] in 1979 (by John [[Calder]] and Viking Penguin) in [[text]] form only under the original [[title]] of Ah Pook [[Is]] [[Here]]. After 30 years the [[original]] visual works were resurrected and restored by Mc Neill for a West Coast showing at [[Track]] 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, CA, [[April]] 4th to May [[2nd]], 2009 and a [[December]] 2008 showing in New [[York]] at Saloman Arts Gallery. [[Burroughs]] [[reads]] from Ah Pook Is Here on his [[1990]] [[recording]] [[Dead]] City Radio; this [[recording]], in turn, formed the soundtrack to the animated short Ah Pook Is Here directed by Philip Hunt and featured music by John [[Cale]].","Ah Pook [[Iѕ]] Here was a collaboration between [[authoⲅ]] [[Williaｍ]] S.

In October 2010, he was the first of several federal court judges to hear a case concerning the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The main question here is whether the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States gives the United States Congress the authority to buy any commercial product, which in this case is health insurance. Judge Steeh ruled that the Act is constitutional, writing: \""These decisions, viewed in the aggregate have clear and direct impacts on health care providers, taxpayers and the insured population who ultimately pay for the care provided to those who go without insurance,\"" and that choosing not to obtain health insurance qualifies as an example of \""activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"" [[According]] to the Supreme Court of the United States, if a federal law arbitrates activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, then that law complies with the Commerce Clause.

He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 13, 1998, and received his commission on May 22, 1998. He assumed senior status on January 29, 2013. In October 2010, he was the first of several federal court judges to hear a case concerning the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. The main question here is whether the Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the United States gives the United States Congress the authority to buy any commercial product, which in this case is health insurance. Judge Steeh ruled that the Act is constitutional, writing: \""These decisions, viewed in the aggregate have clear and direct impacts on health care providers, taxpayers and the insured population who ultimately pay for the care provided to those who go without insurance,\"" and that choosing not to obtain health insurance qualifies as an example of \""activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"" [[Accorԁing]] to the Supreme Court of the United States, if a federal law arbitrates activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, then that law complies with the Commerce Clause. Steeh's father, George C. Steeh, served in the Michigan Legislature and as a district court [[juԁge]] in Macomb County.",0

"The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland and, formerly, in Germany) or [[ICE]] (German pronunciation: [iːtseːˈʔeː]) is a [[system]] of high-speed trains predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service [[category]] offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam. On 10 June 2007, a new line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart was opened, jointly operated by ICE and TGV trains. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2018. While ICE 3M trains operate the Paris-Frankfurt service (with the exception of trains 9553/9552, which operate with TGV Duplex equipment and are cross-crewed with both SNCF and DB staff), SNCF's TGV runs from Paris to Munich (via Stuttgart), with mixed crews on both trains. German and Austrian ICE T trains run to Vienna. On 9 December 2007, the ICE TD was introduced on the service from Berlin via Hamburg to the Danish cities of Aarhus and Copenhagen. The Spanish railway operator RENFE also employs trains based on the ICE 3 (Siemens Velaro) called AVE Class 103 which are certified to run at speeds up to 350 km/h.

It is the highest service [[categoⲅy]] offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam. On 10 June 2007, a new line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart was opened, jointly operated by ICE and TGV trains. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2018.

"The Cimmeron Show Review was originally a 1960s Revival [[Band]] originating in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA in 1972.

"(In this name, the family name is Law, not [[Bonar]] Law.) Andrew [[Bonar]] Law (16 September [[1858]] – 30 October 1923), commonly called [[Bonar]] Law (), was a [[British]] [[Conservative]] [[Party]] [[statesman]] and [[Prime]] [[Minister]]. [[Born]] in the [[colony]] of New [[Brunswick]] (now in [[Canada]]), he is the only British [[Prime]] [[Minister]] to have been [[born]] outside the British [[Isles]]. [[Law]] was of [[Scottish]] and Ulster [[Scots]] descent, and having [[moved]] back to Scotland in [[1870]], he left [[school]] aged sixteen to [[work]] in the iron industry, [[becoming]] a wealthy [[man]] by the [[age]] of thirty. He [[entered]] [[Parliament]] at the [[1900]] general election, relatively late in [[life]] for a [[front-rank]] [[politician]], and was [[made]] a [[junior]] [[minister]], [[Parliamentary]] [[Secretary]] to the [[Board]] of Trade, in [[1902]]. [[Law]] [[joined]] the Shadow [[Cabinet]] in opposition after the [[1906]] election. In [[1911]] he was [[appointed]] a Privy Councillor, and stood for the vacant [[party]] [[leadership]]. Despite [[never]] having [[served]] in the [[Cabinet]], and despite trailing [[third]] after [[Walter]] Long and [[Austen]] Chamberlain, [[Law]] [[became]] [[leader]] when the two frontrunners [[withdrew]] rather than risk a draw splitting the [[party]]. [[As]] Leader of the Conservative [[Party]] and [[Leader]] of the [[Opposition]], [[Law]] focused his [[attentions]] in favour of [[tariff]] reform and against Irish Home Rule. [[His]] campaigning [[helped]] [[turn]] [[Liberal]] attempts to [[pass]] the Third Home Rule Bill into a [[three-year]] struggle [[eventually]] halted by the start of the First World War, with [[much]] argument over the status of the six predominantly Protestant counties which would [[later]] [[become]] Northern Ireland. [[Law]] [[first]] held [[Cabinet]] [[office]] as [[Secretary]] of [[State]] for the Colonies in Asquith's Coalition Government (May [[1915-December]] [[1916]]). On [[Asquith's]] fall from power he [[declined]] to [[form]] a [[government]], instead [[serving]] as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lloyd George's Coalition Government. He resigned on grounds of [[ill-health]] early in 1921. In October 1922, with Lloyd [[George's]] Coalition having become unpopular with Conservatives, he wrote an anonymous letter to the press giving only [[lukewarm]] support to the [[Government's]] actions over [[Chanak]]. After Conservative MPs voted to end the Coalition, he again became Party Leader and, this time, Prime Minister. In November he won a clear majority at the 1922 [[general]] election. [[His]] brief premiership saw negotiation with the USA over Britain's war loans. Seriously ill with throat cancer, Law resigned in May 1923 and died later that year. [[He]] was the [[shortest-serving]] Prime Minister of the 20th century (211 days in office) and is sometimes [[called]] \""The Unknown Prime Minister\"".","(In this name, the family name is Law, not [[Bnoar]] Law.)

"For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region. The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia.

"[[Kurz]] and Allison were a major [[publisher]] of chromolithographs in the late 19th century.

In all, a set of thirty-six battle scenes were published from designs by Louis Kurz (1835–1921), himself a veteran of the war. Kurz, a native of Salzburg, Austria, had emigrated to the United States in 1848. While the prints were highly inaccurate and considered naive fantasies like Currier and Ives prints, they were still sought after. They did not pretend to mirror the actual events but rather attempted to tap people's patriotic emotions. When the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898, the company created several large prints of the major battles and of the subsequent campaign of the Philippine–American War.

"[[Bangladesh]] Jamaat-e-Islami ([[Bengali]]: বাংলাদেশ জামায়াতে ইসলামী), [[previously]] [[known]] as Jamaat-e-Islami [[Bangladesh]], or Jamaat for short, is the largest [[Islamist]] [[political]] party in Bangladesh. On 1 August 2013 the Bangladesh [[Supreme]] [[Court]] declared the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami [[illegal]], [[ruling]] that the party is [[unfit]] to [[contest]] national polls. It was [[founded]] on [[26]] [[August]] [[1941]], But after the dividing of Pakistan it has run their activities as Bangladesh [[Jamaat-e-Islami]]. It is said that the predecessor of the [[party]] (Jamaat-e-Islami [[Pakistan]]) strongly opposed the independence of Bangladesh and break-up of [[Pakistan]]. In 1971, it collaborated with the [[Pakistani]] Army in its operations against [[Bengali]] nationalists and [[pro-liberation]] [[intellectuals]]. Upon the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the [[new]] [[government]] banned Jamaat-e-Islami from [[political]] participation and its leaders went into exile in [[Pakistan]]. Following the assassination of the [[first]] president and the [[military]] coup that brought Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman to power in Bangladesh in 1975, the ban on the Jamaat was lifted and the [[new]] [[party]] [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] Bangladesh was [[formed]]. [[Its]] leaders were allowed to return. Abbas Ali Khan was the first Amir of [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] Bangladesh. The [[Jamaat]] agenda is the creation of an \""Islamic state\"" with the [[Sha'ria]] legal system, and outlawing \""[[un-Islamic]]\"" practices and laws. In the 1980s, the [[Jamaat]] joined the [[multi-party]] alliance for the restoration of democracy. [[It]] later allied with [[Ziaur]] [[Rahman's]] Bangladesh Nationalist [[Party]] and Jamaat leaders became [[ministers]] in the two [[BNP-led]] regimes of prime minister Begum [[Khaleda]] Zia (from 1991 to [[1996]] and from [[2001]] to 2006). [[Its]] popularity has [[decreased]] and in 2008, it won only [[two]] of 300 elected [[seats]] in Parliament.

In [[response]], the [[Jamaat]] has held major [[strikes]] and violent protests across the country, which have led to more than 60 deaths (mostly by security forces) and alleged mass destruction of public and national properties.
