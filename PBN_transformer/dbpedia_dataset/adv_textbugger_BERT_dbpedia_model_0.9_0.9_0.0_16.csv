"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in [[Cheshire-Prospect]], Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The [[group's]] earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before [[disbanding]]. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph [[Muscatelli]] (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The [[group]] disbanded soon thereafter.

"[[AIA]] [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as AIA ([[Chinese]]: [[友邦保險控股有限公司]]) is the largest [[independent]] [[public]] listed [[pan-Asian]] [[life]] [[insurance]] [[group]]. It has a presence in [[18]] markets in [[Asia-Pacific]], [[wholly]] [[owned]] branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, [[Thailand]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], China, Korea, the [[Philippines]], [[Australia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], [[New]] [[Zealand]], Macau, Brunei, a [[97]]% subsidiary in [[Sri]] Lanka, a [[26]]% [[joint]] venture in India, and [[representative]] offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. [[AIA]] [[traces]] its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young [[man]] named Cornelius Vander Starr [[opened]] an insurance [[agency]] in Shanghai, China. [[Vander]] Starr eventually [[expanded]] his [[business]] throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he [[relocated]] his [[head]] office from Shanghai to New York after a [[forced]] [[exit]] from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of [[New]] York-based American [[International]] Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as [[well]] as [[ALICO]] (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special [[purpose]] vehicle in exchange for the Federal [[Reserve]] [[Bank]] of New York. AIA was planned to be [[listed]] in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March [[2010]], Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial [[services]] and [[securities]] company, announced that it would buy [[AIA]] for US$[[35]].5 [[billion]]. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in [[October]] [[2010]], raising [[approximately]] HK$[[159]].[[08]] billion (US$20.51 billion), the [[world's]] third largest IPO ever. In September [[2012]], [[AIA]] [[agreed]] to acquire a [[92]].[[3]]% stake in [[Sri]] Lankan insurer Aviva NDB [[Insurance]] from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's [[National]] [[Development]] [[Bank]] ([[NDB]]). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive [[20-year]] bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of [[Sri]] [[Lanka's]] largest [[financial]] conglomerates with a nationwide [[bank]] branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had [[reached]] an agreement to [[acquire]] ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a [[cash]] [[consideration]] of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season.

In 1945, he [[relocateԁ]] his [[heaԁ]] office from Shanghai to New York after a [[forceԁ]] [[exi𝚝]] from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of [[Neԝ]] York-based American [[Internationaⅼ]] Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as [[welⅼ]] as [[AILCO]] (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special [[purpoѕe]] vehicle in exchange for the Federal [[Reserѵe]] [[Ban𝒌]] of New York. AIA was planned to be [[listeԁ]] in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March [[ᒿ010]], Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial [[sеrvices]] and [[securitieѕ]] company, announced that it would buy [[AA]] for US$[[3Ƽ]].5 [[bilⅼion]]. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in [[Octobeⲅ]] [[ᒿ010]], raising [[approximateⅼy]] HK$[[15৭]].[[0Ȣ]] billion (US$20.51 billion), the [[world`s]] third largest IPO ever. In September [[201ᒿ]], [[A]] [[IA]] [[agreeԁ]] to acquire a [[9ᒿ]].[[Ʒ]]% stake in [[Sⲅi]] Lankan insurer Aviva NDB [[Insuranϲe]] from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's [[Nationaⅼ]] [[Developmen𝚝]] [[Ban𝒌]] ([[NB]]). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive [[20-yеar]] bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of [[Sⲅi]] [[Lanka`s]] largest [[finanϲial]] conglomerates with a nationwide [[ban𝒌]] branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had [[reacheԁ]] an agreement to [[acquiⲅe]] ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a [[caѕh]] [[consideratin]] of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season. In June 2014, AIA Singapore was named \""Best Employer to Work For in Asia\"" and received the award from HR Asia.",0

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"[[Weyerbacher]] Brewing [[Company]] is a brewery in [[Easton]], Pennsylvania, United [[States]], [[founded]] in [[1995]] by Dan and Sue [[Weirback]]. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in [[wooden]] [[barrels]] [[previously]] used for aging bourbon.

"[[Federal]] [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after [[winning]] [[153]] of the 491 [[seats]]. [[Voter]] turnout was 75.6%.

However, [[although]] the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the [[end]] of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","[[Fеderal]] [[eelctions]] were [[hеld]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred [[steel]] bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. [[The]] group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

[[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""[[super-railroad]]\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] [[rail]] [[line]], built upon large cuts and [[fills]], and which included [[two]] large [[concrete]] viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed [[travel]] at that time.

The [[Cut-Off]] ran [[west]] for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — [[near]] the south end of Lake [[Hopatcong]] in [[New]] Jersey, about 45 miles (72 [[km]]) [[west-northwest]] of New [[York]] City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976.

"The Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a [[large]] [[wrought]] [[iron]] box girder [[bridge]] over Back Creek at [[Taradale]], [[Victoria]] on the [[Bendigo]] Railway in [[Victoria]] [[Australia]]. [[It]] was [[erected]] as [[part]] of the Melbourne, Mount [[Alexander]] and [[Murray]] River Railway between [[1858]] and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail [[bridges]] built in [[Australia]]. Construction of the [[Bendigo]] [[line]] commenced under the Melbourne, [[Mount]] [[Alexander]] and [[Murray]] River Railway Company in 1858, but this private [[consortium]] [[met]] with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the [[Victorian]] [[colonial]] government in 1860 when it formed the [[Victorian]] Railways [[Department]]. The [[design]] work was then taken over by Captain Andrew [[Clarke]], R. E., Surveyor-General of [[Victoria]], with the [[bridge]] designs completed by [[Bryson]] and [[O'Hara]] The ironwork for the [[bridge]] was made by [[Rowland]] Brotherhood, of [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer [[Isambard]] Kingdom [[Brunel]]. The [[foundation]] [[stone]] was [[laid]] by [[Mr]]. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the [[line]] from [[Footscray]] to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was [[let]] to [[Cornish]] and [[Bruce]] for £3,[[356]],[[937]].[[2s]].2d ($6.[[714]] million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. [[Clarke]] appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and [[viaducts]], while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative [[Assembly]] on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[line]]. [[Clarke]] clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this [[approach]] was later abandoned for more economic light [[lines]] in later [[Australian]] Railways. [[William]] Edward [[Bryson]] was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal [[Society]] of Victoria [[1859-60]] and employed at the \""Government [[Railway]] Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the [[20th]] century required strengthening of the [[bridge]] with steel trestles added between the original masonry [[piers]] in [[1933-1934]].

"The Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system. Those who adopted these new forms of public mobilization for democratic reform in Upper Canada were inspired by the more radical Owenite Socialists who led the British Chartist and Mechanics Institute movements.","The Reform [[movemeոt]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues.

"The [[Usoi]] Dam is a natural landslide [[dam]] [[along]] the Murghab [[River]] in [[Tajikistan]]. [[At]] [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] [[ft]]) high, it is the tallest [[dam]] in the [[world]], either natural or [[man-made]]. The [[dam]] was [[created]] on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that [[blocked]] the [[flow]] of the [[river]]. The [[dam]] is [[formed]] of [[approximately]] [[2]] cubic [[kilometres]] (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped [[river]] [[valley]] of the Murghab, which cuts from [[east]] to [[west]] through the high and [[rough]] Pamir Mountains. [[It]] is [[named]] after the [[village]] of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] [[rises]] to a height of [[500]] to [[700]] [[metres]] (1,[[600]] to 2,300 ft) from the [[original]] [[valley]] floor.

"The University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) holds its basketball tournaments from July to October. Basketball is a mandatory sport in the UAAP. All eight universities participate in the Men's, [[Women's]], and Juniors (Boys') tournaments. The tournament is divided into two divisions, the Seniors' division, which is further subdivided into the Men's tournament, for male collegiate players, and the Women's tournament for female collegiate players. The other division is the Juniors' which is also subdivided into two tournaments for the male and female high school athletes. The UAAP basketball sport has a rich history of schools establishing dynasties. UE won a record seven consecutive basketball titles from 1965-1971 albeit the third one was a shared championship with UST. Ateneo had a 5 year winning streak from 2008 to 2012. Two other schools ended their championship streak at four. UST won it from 1993-1996 and La Salle from 1998-2001. Championship in basketball is the most coveted title that schools aspire for during a UAAP season, but such aspirations have resulted in many controversies in the league. There are protests filed by the member-schools against each other almost every season.

"The 2004 Virginia Tech Hokies football represented represented the Virginia Tech in the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football [[season]]. Virginia [[Tech]] won the Atlantic Coast [[Conference]] championship in its inaugural year in the conference, [[running]] off a streak of [[eight]] [[straight]] [[wins]] to end the [[regular]] [[season]] after a [[2]]–[[2]] [[start]]. Tech [[finished]] 10th in the final [[Associated]] [[Press]] [[poll]] with a 10–[[3]] [[record]]. [[The]] team's [[head]] [[coach]] was [[Frank]] Beamer, who was [[named]] [[ACC]] [[Coach]] of the [[Year]]. Virginia Tech began the [[season]] unranked nationally, having suffered a meltdown at the end of the 2003 season. The Hokies faced a daunting schedule, beginning with a nationally-televisioned game against the defending national co-champion USC Trojans. That game, known as the BCA Classic, was the first NCAA college football game of the year, and would be followed by a tough conference schedule. Tech lost to eventual BCS National Champion USC at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, 24-13, losing the lead late in the third quarter. After a 63-0 shellacking of Western Michigan, Tech played its first ever ACC game on September 18, against Duke. Tech prevailed 41-17 in Lane Stadium. The Hokies dropped to 2-2 following a 17-16 home loss to N.C. State, in which the Hokies missed a would-be winning field goal as time expired. The team then needed to win five of its next eight games to extend its 11-season streak of playing in a post-season bowl game. After reeling off three-straight wins, including a 19-13 squeaker over then #7 West Virginia, the Hokies' fortunes looked bleak in the fourth quarter of their game against Georgia Tech in Atlanta on ESPN Thursday night college football. Tech was down 14-0 at one point and trailed 20-12 with 5:28 left in the fourth quarter. Tech racked up 22 unanswered points to exterminate the Yellow Jackets. Tech would go on to win their remaining regular-season games, including a 24-10 win over then #16 Virginia in Lane Stadium and a 16-10 away victory over then #9 Miami, to clinch the ACC Championship. As ACC Champions, Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2005 Sugar Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game in New Orleans, Louisiana. Virginia Tech faced Auburn, a team that had gone undefeated in the regular season but was denied a bid to the national championship game by virtue of its lower rank in the BCS poll. In a game that was not decided until the final two minutes, Virginia Tech lost to Auburn 16-13. Tech was led by quarterback Bryan Randall during the season.

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The [[library]] is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

"Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a [[waltz]] by Johann Strauss II [[composed]] in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien. The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' ich mit Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben\"" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta. The operetta itself was a success at its first performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of [[opera]] composers to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be arranged as a new [[piece]] to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'.

The [[piece]] began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. The principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief coda enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated. After a short chorded passage, the swirling Waltz 1A recurs and Strauss signs off the waltz with a strong chord and long snare-drumroll.","Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a [[ԝaltz]] by Johann Strauss II [[composeԁ]] in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010.

"The Raving Loony Green Giant [[Party]] was a [[political]] [[party]] in the United Kingdom. [[It]] was [[founded]] in [[1989]] by [[former]] [[members]] of the [[Official]] [[Monster]] Raving Loony [[Party]] (OMRLP) after [[clashes]] between them and other members of the [[party]] over direction and party [[activities]] – in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the OMRLP – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. The party became effectively defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the OMRLP. It has not stood any candidates for a number of years and is not registered with the Electoral Commission.

"[[The]] [[1998]] FIFA World [[Cup]] [[Final]] was a football [[match]] that was played on [[12]] [[July]] 1998 at the [[Stade]] [[de]] France in Saint-Denis to [[determine]] the [[winner]] of the 1998 [[FIFA]] [[World]] [[Cup]]. [[The]] [[final]] was contested by Brazil, who were the defending champions having won the previous [[FIFA]] [[World]] [[Cup]] four years earlier in 1994, and the host nation France, who had reached the final of the tournament for the first time.France won the [[match]] [[3]]–[[0]] to claim the World Cup for the [[first]] [[time]], with the timing of the [[match]] [[two]] [[days]] before Bastille Day adding to the significance of the victory. Zinedine Zidane, who was named man of the match, scored twice before half-time and Emmanuel Petit added a third goal in the last minute. The match had an attendance in the region of 75,000. On their way to the final, defending champions Brazil, coached by their former player Mário Zagallo, recorded victories over Scotland (2–1) and Morocco (3–0) to top their group with 6 points from three matches, suffering a surprise 2–1 defeat at the hands of Norway in their final group game. After a 4–1 win over Chile and a 3–2 success against Denmark, they reached the final with a penalty shoot-out victory over the Netherlands. As for France, they won their three group matches and defeated Paraguay in the knockout stages on golden goals. They had a penalty-shootout with Italy in the quarter-finals, and defeated recently formed Croatia to reach the final. The match also saw speculation on the condition of the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who suffered a convulsive fit on the eve of the match.

"The Bavarian People's [[Party]] (German: Bayerische Volkspartei; BVP) was the [[Bavarian]] [[branch]] of the [[Centre]] [[Party]], a [[lay]] [[Roman]] [[Catholic]] [[party]], which [[broke]] off from the rest of the [[party]] in [[1918]] to pursue a more conservative, more [[Bavarian]] particularist course.

Had England won the competition, they would have become not only the first nation to retain the Rugby World Cup, which they had won in 2003, but the only team to win a final after having lost a game at the pool stage. Winners South Africa became the second country to win two titles, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999. The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. This gave South Africa a 15–6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try and also not conceded a try in the final. Each team did have one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second.

Swimming in [[lane]] seven, the dark [[horse]] threw down a scorching time and a [[textile]] [[best]] of 21.34 to [[hold]] off U.S. swimmer [[Cullen]] Jones and the event's [[Brazilian]] world record holder and defending Olympic champion César Cielo by two-tenths of a [[second]], a [[sizable]] chunk in the [[Olympic]] swimming's shortest [[race]]. [[Jones]] [[took]] [[home]] the [[silver]] in 21.54 to match his semifinal time in the process, while Cielo [[missed]] his chance to defend the title with a bronze [[medal]] in 21.[[59]]. Cielo's [[teammate]] [[Bruno]] Fratus finished outside the podium by almost a fingertip with a fourth-place time in 21.61. After twelve years of absence as a 31-year-old, U.S. swimmer Anthony Ervin, who previously tied with Gary Hall, Jr. for the gold in 2000, managed to pull off a fifth-place finish in 21.78. Ervin was followed in sixth and seventh by four-time Olympians Roland Mark Schoeman of South Africa (21.80) and George Bovell of Trinidad and Tobago (21.82). Plagued by injury, Australia's Eamon Sullivan struggled to mount a sprint challenge in a high-calibre race as he finished eighth in 21.98. Earlier in the semifinals, Australia's top sprinter James Magnussen missed the star-studded roster with an eleventh-place time in 22.00. Other notable swimmers featured Swedish veteran Stefan Nystrand (22.32) and France's Amaury Leveaux (22.35), the defending silver medalist, both of whom fell short of the semifinal field by a small fraction of a second on the morning prelims.","[[Te]] men's 50 [[mеtre]] freestyle event at the 2012 [[Summeⲅ]] [[Olympicѕ]] [[tok]] [[plɑce]] on [[ᒿ]]–[[Ʒ]] [[Augus𝚝]] at the [[Lonԁon]] [[Aquaticѕ]] [[Centⲅe]] in [[Lonԁon]], [[Uniteԁ]] [[Kingdoｍ]].

"[[Radio]] [[Trinidad]] was the oldest [[radio]] station in Trinidad and Tobago. It began broadcasting in [[1947]] at [[11B]] Maraval [[Road]] in [[Port]] of [[Spain]] on the frequency [[730]] AM. Over the [[years]], the [[station]] [[successfully]] hosted a [[wide]] variety of [[programmes]] including [[soap]] [[operas]], local and [[international]] [[news]], [[educational]] documentaries such as the [[School]] [[Broadcasting]] [[Unit's]] show, which [[aired]] around 10a.m. on Mondays to Fridays when school was in session, and The [[Passing]] Parade hosted by John [[Doremus]]. The [[station's]] announcers [[included]] June [[Gonsalves]], Barbara Assoon, [[Glen]] [[Antoine]], Sam [[Ghany]], Ken Laughlin, Hugh Blackman, Larry Heywood, Val [[Douglas]], [[Russell]] Winston, Trevor McDonald, Holly [[Betaudier]], Peter [[Minshall]], Don Proudfoot, Bob Gittens and [[Raffie]] Knowles. Two of the most popular programmes were: \n*  Sunday Serenade, a show that featured performers of the day including the [[Mighty]] [[Sparrow]] and [[Ken]] Hutcheon), broadcast at [[noon]] on Sundays co-hosted by Bob Gittens and Sam [[Ghany]]. \n*  Auntie Kay, a [[children's]] talent show named after its [[presenter]] Kathleen [[Davis]], which ran on Sundays at 2 p.m. and was sponsored by the Bermudez Biscuit Company. The back-up band was Choy Aming and the featured pianists were Aldwyn Albino and Dawlett Ahee. Among other regular features were the Cook Caribbean Jazz programme (which took its name from a Trinidad recording company, Cook Caribbean, that originally produced 78rpm records and later continued with the 33 1⁄3 format), and The Indian Hour at 6 p.m. every day.

"[[Pierre]] [[Charles]] [[Fournier]] de [[Saint-Amant]] ([[12]] [[September]] 1800 – [[29]] [[October]] [[1872]]) was a leading French [[chess]] [[master]] and an editor of the chess periodical Le [[Palamède]]. He is [[best]] known for [[losing]] a [[match]] against Howard [[Staunton]] in 1843 that is often considered to have been an [[unofficial]] [[match]] for the [[World]] [[Chess]] [[Championship]]. [[Saint-Amant]] learned chess from [[Wilhelm]] [[Schlumberger]], who later became the operator of [[The]] [[Turk]]. He [[played]] at the [[Café]] [[de]] la [[Régence]], where he was a student of Alexandre [[Deschapelles]]. [[For]] many years he played on level [[terms]] with [[Boncourt]], a strong player, and [[received]] odds of pawn and [[two]] moves from [[Deschapelles]] and Louis-Charles [[Mahé]] [[de]] La [[Bourdonnais]]. In 1834–36, he [[led]] a [[Paris]] [[team]] that won both [[games]] of a [[correspondence]] chess [[match]] against the [[Westminster]] Club, then England's [[leading]] [[chess]] club. After La [[Bourdonnais']] [[death]] in [[1840]], he was considered the country's best player. In [[December]] 1841 he revived Le Palamède (at its inception in 1836 the world's [[first]] [[chess]] periodical), which [[ran]] until 1847. He played [[two]] matches against [[Staunton]] in [[1843]]. The first, in [[London]], he won [[3½]]–2½ ([[three]] wins, one [[draw]], [[two]] [[losses]]), but he lost a return [[match]] in Paris just before [[Christmas]] 13–[[8]] ([[six]] wins, [[four]] draws, eleven losses). This [[second]] [[match]] is sometimes considered an [[unofficial]] [[world]] [[championship]] [[match]]. In [[1858]], [[Saint-Amant]] [[played]] in the Birmingham [[tournament]], a knockout [[event]]. He won in the [[first]] [[round]], but [[lost]] in the second by a [[2]]–[[1]] [[score]] to [[Ernst]] [[Falkbeer]]. Returning to [[Paris]], he witnessed the adulatory reception accorded [[Paul]] [[Morphy]] at the Café de [[la]] [[Régence]].

He was [[dismissed]] from that appointment after he [[protested]] against the slave trade that still existed in that colony. After that, he tried his hand as a [[journalist]] and actor, then [[became]] a [[successful]] wine [[merchant]]. [[He]] was a captain in the [[French]] National Guard during the 1848 revolution. For his role in saving the Palais [[des]] Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851–52, he was the French consul to California.

"Mosh n' Roll is the sixth [[studio]] [[album]] from metalcore band Bury [[Your]] [[Dead]]. [[Most]] notably, the [[album]] [[marks]] the [[return]] of the band's former vocalist, [[Mat]] Bruso. Bruso, who departed from the band after the [[recording]] of their [[2006]] effort, [[Beauty]] And [[The]] [[Breakdown]], was eventually replaced by the [then] fill-in frontman Myke Terry. [[During]] his [[time]] with the band, Terry helped write and record two full-length [[albums]]: Bury Your Dead (2008) and It's Nothing Personal (2009). Terry left the band in 2010, paving the way for Bruso's return. Mosh n' Roll contains 11 audio tracks, although the final track, \""Mosh n' Roll\"" (identical to the album title) is not listed on the back cover or in the liner notes. The song itself was originally recorded and featured on the band's first official album, You Had Me At Hello (2002). The version that appears on Mosh n' Roll (the 2011 album) is simply a re-recorded [[version]] of the original, which has become somewhat of an anthem at [[Bury]] Your [[Dead]] shows throughout their many years of [[touring]]. Both the re-recorded track, as well as the 2011 album's title pay homage to Bury Your Dead's roots, particularly when the essential reformation of the band under which the song was originally written is taken into consideration. Of interesting note, with the exception of the above-mentioned title track, all of the songs on the album are named after Kurt Vonnegut works. This would not be the first time a Bury Your Dead album carried thematic overtones -- all of the song titles on Cover Your Tracks (2004) are named after movies featuring Tom Cruise, while Beauty and the Breakdown carried an even more holistic theme based on [[children's]] [[fairy-tales]]. The theme was not simply impressed upon track titles; it permeated the artwork, style, and was creatively incorporated into the fundamental lyrical content, itself. The album was recorded in Hyannis, MA at the The Brick HitHouse studios by Producer Shane Frisby (Frisby also produced the previous album \""it's nothing personal\""). Some 7-8 months after the announcement of Mat Bruso's return to the band, Mosh n' Roll was [[released]] on August 2nd, 2011 through Mediaskare Records.

"The Irish [[Independence]] [[Party]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). The [[party]] was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. The party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. Its best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, leaving the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early 1980s. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate nationalists had remained with the SDLP. The party remained active until at least 1985, when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been disbanded before the next local elections in 1989.","The Irish [[Independeոce]] [[Praty]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[prty]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).

"[[Annemarie]] [[Mol]] ([[born]] [[13]] [[September]] [[1958]] in Schaesberg) is a Dutch ethnographer and philosopher. She is the Professor of Anthropology of the Body at the University of Amsterdam. Winner of the Constantijn & Christiaan Huijgens Grant from the NWO in 1990 to study 'Differences in Medicine', she was awarded a European Research Council Advanced Grant in 2010 to study 'The Eating Body in Western Practice and Theory'. She has helped to develop post-ANT/feminist understandings of science, technology and medicine. In her earlier work she explored the performativity of health care practices, argued that realities are generated within those practices, and noted that since practices differ, so too do realities. The body, as she expressed it, is multiple: it is more than one but it is also less than many (since the different versions of the body also overlap in health care practices). This is an empirical argument about ontology (which is the branch of philosophy that explores being, existence, or the categories of being.) As a part of this she also developed the notion of 'ontological politics', arguing that since realities or the conditions of possibility vary between practices, this means that they are not given but might be changed. Mol has been member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2013. Mol has written and worked with a range of scholars including John Law. In a recent talk, Mol relates the concept of globalization to the interconnections of nature.","[[Annemaⲅie]] [[Ml]] ([[bron]] [[l3]] [[Seрtember]] [[195Ȣ]] in Schaesberg) is a Dutch ethnographer and philosopher.

[[On]] 9 [[August]] 1994, the Dingle family arrived in Emmerdale, and on that very night during a rave, Ben Dingle started a fight with Luke, during which Ben [[inexplicably]] died.
