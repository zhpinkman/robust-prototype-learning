Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"[[William]] Harold Lee (December 9, [[1884]] ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an [[American]] [[20th]] century movie theater [[designer]] and later the [[chief]] architect for Eastern College.

"[[Dark]] Discoveries is an internationally [[distributed]], [[quarterly]] [[slick]] magazine [[formerly]] [[published]] by Dark [[Discoveries]] [[Publications]], and now [[published]] by Journalstone, [[LLC]]. It [[focuses]] primarily on the horror fiction, dark [[fantasy]], and [[science]] fiction [[genres]]. The [[magazine's]] content [[includes]] [[short]] [[fiction]], interviews, [[nonfiction]] articles, [[profiles]] of [[industry]] notables, and is fully [[illustrated]]. Dark Discoveries Publications was [[originally]] [[founded]] in January, [[2004]] by James R. Beach of Longview, WA. [[The]] magazine [[began]] as a black and white periodical with David Emrich, of [[David]] Emrich [[Design]], doing the layout and [[art]] direction from [[2004]] to [[2007]]. Together Editor-in-chief Beach and [[designer]] Emrich created the [[basic]] [[look]] and feel of the magazine that [[continued]] through the [[first]] ten issues. [[Designer]] Cesar Puch [[briefly]] took over the layout for [[two]] issues in [[2008]], but left for a [[job]] with Bad [[Moon]] [[Books]] after that.

[[Among]] many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and [[content-wise]]) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically [[compelling]] look, and a [[renewed]] focus on [[media]] outside of the small press, [[namely]] film, [[television]], and the art world. [[Brock]] [[left]] the magazine and the website in [[mid-2012]]; his last full issue was #19, which [[focused]] on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into [[2013]], and he was [[credited]] as Art [[Director]] for issue #20, as the [[magazine]] was transitioned to [[new]] staff [[following]] [[Brock's]] departure to become [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the [[biannual]] horror literary [[publication]] [[Nameless]] Digest, published by Cycatrix Press. Dark Discoveries, both the [[magazine]] and name, were purchased by [[JournalStone]], LLC. Owner/President [[Christopher]] C. Payne in August, [[2012]]. The page count was expanded, the format [[changed]] to a perfect-bound magazine, and color was added to all of the [[pages]], the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all [[concepts]] Brock had [[predicted]] would be [[needed]] to continue the [[magazine]]).

[[Considered]] a detached [[object]], it [[orbits]] the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit every [[3305]] years at an average [[distance]] of [[222]] astronomical units (AU).

Mike Brown's [[websiùöùe]] lists it as a [[possib‚Öºe]] dwarf [[planeùöù]] with a [[diamete‚≤Ö]] of [[32»¢]] [[kilometr–µs]] ([[24]] mi) [[base‘Å]] on an assumed albedo of [[O]].04.

It is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their [[currenùöù]], [[farflung]] orbits. Several hypotheses have been [[puùöù]] [[forawrd]]: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing [[st…ër]]. \n*  They were pulled from their [[origina‚Öº]] positions by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered ([[albeiùöù]] unlikely), giant planet. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an undiscovered [[coÔΩçpanion]] [[sar]] orbiting the Sun. \[[’∏*]]  They were captured from [[anot’∞er]] [[planeta‚≤Öy]] system during a [[clo—ïe]] encounter early in the [[Sn's]] history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a [[1∆º]]% probability that a [[sta‚≤Ö]] like the Sun had an early close encounter and a [[l]]% probability that outer [[planeta‚≤Öy]] exchanges would have happened. (148209) 2000 CR105 is estimated to be 2‚Äì3 times more likely to be a captured [[planeta‚≤Öy]] object than Sedna. ([[148029]]) 2000 CR105 is the [[fist]] object discovered in the [[Solr]] System to have a semi-major axis exceeding [[10]] AU, a perihelion [[bey–ænd]] Neptune, and an argument of perihelion of [[30]] ¬± 55¬∞.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks.

"[[90377]] Sedna is a [[large]] [[minor]] planet in the [[outer]] reaches of the [[Solar]] [[System]] that was, as of [[2015]], at a distance of about [[86]] [[astronomical]] [[units]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[three]] times as [[far]] as [[Neptune]]. Spectroscopy has [[revealed]] that Sedna's [[surface]] [[composition]] is [[similar]] to that of some other [[trans-Neptunian]] [[objects]], being [[largely]] a mixture of [[water]], [[methane]], and nitrogen [[ices]] with tholins. [[Its]] surface is one of the reddest among [[Solar]] System [[objects]]. It is most likely a dwarf planet. For most of its orbit, it is [[even]] farther from the Sun than at present, with its [[aphelion]] estimated at [[937]] AU (31 times Neptune's distance), making it one of the most [[distant]] [[known]] objects in the [[Solar]] System other than [[long-period]] [[comets]]. Sedna has an exceptionally long and elongated orbit, [[taking]] approximately 11,[[400]] years to complete and a distant point of [[closest]] approach to the Sun at [[76]] AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its [[origin]]. The Minor [[Planet]] [[Center]] currently [[places]] Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the [[gravitational]] influence of [[Neptune]]. However, this classification has been contested, because [[Sedna]] never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. [[Others]] speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another [[hypothesis]] suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a [[large]] planet beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. [[Astronomer]] [[Michael]] E. [[Brown]], co-discoverer of Sedna and the dwarf planets [[Eris]], Haumea, and Makemake, thinks that it is the most scientifically important [[trans-Neptunian]] [[object]] found to date, because understanding its [[unusual]] orbit is likely to [[yield]] [[valuable]] information about the origin and [[early]] evolution of the [[Solar]] System.","[[9037ùüï]] Sedna is a [[la‚≤Öge]] [[mino‚≤Ö]] planet in the [[out–µr]] reaches of the [[Sola‚≤Ö]] [[SysteÔΩç]] that was, as of [[201∆º]], at a distance of about [[»¢6]] [[astronomica‚Öº]] [[unit—ï]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[th‚≤Öee]] times as [[fa‚≤Ö]] as [[Nepùöùune]].

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or [[phylum]] of the kingdom Fungi that, [[together]] with the [[Basidiomycota]], [[form]] the [[subkingdom]] [[Dikarya]]. Its members are [[commonly]] known as the [[sac]] fungi or [[ascomycetes]]. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over [[64]],000 [[species]]. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ ([[askos]]), [[meaning]] \""sac\"" or \""[[wineskin]]\""), a [[microscopic]] [[sexual]] structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the [[Ascomycota]] are [[asexual]], meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not [[form]] asci or [[ascospores]]. Previously placed in the [[Deuteromycota]] along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and [[classified]] based on morphological or physiological similarities to [[ascus-bearing]] taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of [[DNA]] sequences.

[[This]] group is of [[particular]] relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants.

As a four-year-old he showed steady improvement, winning the Grade III Kinko Sho and the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten before defeating a strong international field in the Japan Cup. He remained in training until 1997 but made only five more appearances before his career was ended by injury. He died in 2007.",3

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to [[gain]] a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann M√ºller. Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, [[Centre]] Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more [[concerned]] with their [[self-interest]] than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, M√ºller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, [[rather]] than its electability.","Federal [[election—ï]] were [[hel‘Å]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"Dolomedes /d…íl…ôÀàmiÀêdiÀêz/ is a [[genus]] of [[large]] [[spiders]] of the [[family]] Pisauridae. [[They]] are [[also]] [[known]] as fishing spiders, raft [[spiders]], [[dock]] [[spiders]] or wharf spiders. [[Almost]] all [[Dolomedes]] species are [[semi-aquatic]], with the [[exception]] of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the southwestern United [[States]]. [[Many]] species have a [[striking]] pale stripe down each side of the body. [[They]] hunt by waiting at the edge of a pool or stream, then when they detect the ripples from prey, they run across the surface to subdue it using their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; like other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to kill and digest the prey. They mainly eat insects, but some larger species are able to catch small fish. They can also climb beneath the water, when they become encased in a silvery film of air. Six-spotted spiders can also walk on water to [[get]] their prey. [[Dolomedes]] is derived from the Greek word \""[[dolomed]]\"" which [[means]] [[wily]], deceitful.

The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported \""a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their freights at [[Mnutz]] Street every two or three minutes.\"" Inside, \""the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution\"", and children were passed overhead and placed on the pitch for their own safety. The following Monday the same [[newspape‚≤Ö]] commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators [[mgiht]] well have attended, as \""hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush.\"" The club's landlords would neither sell the freehold of the ground nor allow its expansion, so the directors began planning to move to a new home.",6

Demetrius was a Greek [[Orthodox]] Christian boy born in Floka and raised in [[Ligouditsa]], both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. His mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius left home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a barber. He converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a [[great]] penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a [[Turkish]] friend, who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to let him go. Finally, Demetrius was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully sang Christian hymns in his way), and publicly executed by beheading; it took [[three]] strokes, and his [[severed]] head and body, though ordered to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.","[[Sai’∏t]] Demetrius the [[Neomart—Ér]] ([[Greeùíå]]: ŒÜŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ [[ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÅŒπŒøœÇ]] [[ŒùŒøŒµŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅŒ±œÇ]], or [[ŒÜŒ≥ŒøŒπœÇ]] ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œü ŒùŒ≠ŒøœÇ) is an [[Orthod–æx]] [[Chr—ñstian]] [[sa]] [[int]], commemorated on 14 April in the Church of Greece.

"[[The]] men's single [[sculls]] competition at the 2000 [[Summer]] Olympics in Sydney, [[Australia]] [[took]] [[place]] at the [[Sydney]] [[International]] [[Regatta]] Centre.

"[[The]] [[Journal]] of Economic Education (JEE) offers original peer-reviewed articles on teaching economics. The inaugural issue appeared in the fall of 1969. At the time, G.L. Bach (Stanford University) wrote in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings (1971) that the JEE was to be the forum for scholarly work in [[economic]] education, primarily at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities, but [[including]] junior colleges and, to some extent, the high schools. In the early days, the [[Council]] for Economic Education (then call the Joint Council and later the [[National]] Council) oversaw [[publication]] of the [[JEE]], and members of the American Economic Association Committee on Economic Education served as the editorial board, with Henry [[Villard]] (City University of New York) serving as editor. The Council for Economic Education assigned the JEE copyright and publishing responsibility to the nonprofit Heldref Publications in 1981. The Council, however, retained responsibility for appointing the editor and providing financial support to the editorial office.

It was organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and by local Albanian leaders against the Serbian capture of the regions of Ohrid, Debar and Struga after the Balkan Wars. The rebellion started only two months after the end of the Second Balkan War. The Albanian government organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops.

It was organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and by local Albanian leaders against the Serbian capture of the regions of Ohrid, Debar and Struga after the Balkan Wars. The rebellion started only two months after the end of the Second Balkan War. The Albanian government organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days. After a fortnight of fierce fighting, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising.

"[[Faxinalipterus]] is a [[genus]] of [[vertebrate]], possibly a [[pterosaur]], from the Late Triassic [[Caturrita]] Formation of southern Brazil. [[The]] [[type]] [[species]], [[Faxinalipterus]] [[minima]] was named and described in 2010 by Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte, [[Marina]] [[Bento]] Soares and C√©sar [[Leandro]] Schultz. [[The]] generic [[name]] is [[derived]] from [[Faxinal]] do Soturno and a Latinised [[Greek]] pteron, \""wing\"". The [[specific]] [[name]], from Latin [[minimus]], means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the species were found in 2002 and 2005 at a [[site]] 1.5 kilometres northeast of [[Faxinal]] do Soturno, [[Rio]] Grande do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation [[dating]] from the Carnian-Norian, 220‚Äì[[215]] million years old. The [[holotype]], [[UFRGS]] PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio [[Grande]] do Sul and consists of [[several]], partially fragmentary, limb [[elements]], [[perhaps]] of a single [[individual]]. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three [[teeth]], has been referred to the species. Faxinalipterus is a rather [[small]] animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively [[short]] and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates [[European]] finds from the [[Norian]]. That the [[possible]] age [[difference]] cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the Caturrita Formation consists of [[terrestrial]] sandstones, that evolution [[would]] have had its origins in a terrestrial, not coastal, [[habitat]]. [[They]] also concluded Faxinalipterus is the most basal known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of [[fusion]] between tibia and fibula, a [[thin]] radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the scapula. However, Alexander [[Kellner]] has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"". Dalla Vecchia did not consider Faxinalipterus to be a pterosaur, but did not state what group of vertebrates it belonged to.","[[Fa√óinalipterus]] is a [[gen’Ωs]] of [[veretbrate]], possibly a [[pterosau‚≤Ö]], from the Late Triassic [[Caturrit…ë]] Formation of southern Brazil.

The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""K√∂nnt' ich mit Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben\"" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta.

The [[L…ëney]] Tower is currently the only student newspaper in the four-campus [[districùöù]]. The [[Lane—É]] Tower is a [[bi-week‚Öºy]] tabloid that is published [[eighùöù]] times during the fall and spring semesters on Thursdays. Journalism students enrolled in [[JournalisÔΩç]] 18 and other classes in the [[Lney]] journalism department at the [[campu—ï]] produce the paper. Ironically, the ‚ÄúLaney [[Towe‚≤Ö]]‚Äù name precedes the [[ninestory]] [[Lane—É]] [[Towe‚≤Ö]] [[Administraùöùion]] Building that [[sis]] near the northwest corner of the campus by 19 years. The Laney Tower was previously housed on the [[sixùöùh]] floor of the Tower building and was located in a few other areas on campus before relocating to its present offices in [[G23∆∑]]. The [[Lany]] Tower, though not completely financially independent from the district, has a [[significanùöù]] degree of autonomy. [[Te]] paper does not [[recei—µe]] funds from the Associated Students of Laney [[Col‚Öºege]] (ASLC), and state law prohibits both the district‚Äôs governing board and campus administrators from censuring the paper. There is currently legislation pending which would also shield the newspaper's adviser from legal sanctions or punishment for the actions of staff. The Laney Tower does have an adviser who [[ma]] [[kes]] recommendations to the staff, but allows decisions to be made by the paper‚Äôs Editorial [[Boar‘Å]]. Burt Dragin has served as the Laney Tower adviser since 1971. In 2007, Dragin received the \""Lifetime Achievement Award\"" from the Journalism Association of Community Colleges (JACC), a statewide journalism association. In 2006, the Laney Tower launched the Tower [[Onl—ñne]], the newspaper‚Äôs website. The Tower Online has allowed staff to produce and publish content beyond the current two-week news cycle of the print edition. In recent years, the Laney Tower has earned numerous awards from the JACC, ranging from individual awards for staff writers and photographers, to the coveted General Excellence award recognizing journalism excellence.",1

"No. 51 [[Squadron]] [[RAF]] [[Regiment]] is a field [[squadron]] of the RAF [[Regiment]] in the [[Royal]] Air Force. [[Its]] mission is [[protection]] of RAF bases from ground attack. [[The]] history of No. 51 [[Squadron]] goes back to 1947 when it was [[formed]] at RAF Celle near the L√ºneburg Heath in Germany by the redesignation of No. 2713 Squadron [[RAF]] Regiment. [[Its]] initial role was as a rifle [[squadron]], protecting [[RAF]] facilities from ground attack. In 1955 it changed to the light anti-aircraft role which it retained until disbanded in [[1957]]. In [[1964]] the squadron [[reformed]], switching [[back]] to the rifle [[role]], at the RAF Regiment Depot. The first assignments of the unit after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and [[Aden]] where it [[undertook]] internal security roles. After [[Rhodesia]] unilaterally declared [[independence]] in 1965 it was sent to Africa to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were [[deployed]] in Zambia. After [[returning]] to Catterick the unit's next deployment was back to Aden in the immediate [[period]] before the [[British]] withdrawal from there in [[1967]]. Its [[service]] in Aden was [[mainly]] spent at the many isolated airfields dotting that colony. In [[1968]] the [[squadron]] [[shifted]] [[bases]] with a [[move]] to [[RAF]] Wittering. This move was undertaken to [[support]] the Hawker Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming [[operational]]. With the start of the [[troubles]] in Northern [[Ireland]] in [[1969]], No. 51 [[Squadron]] [[deployed]] to the province, a [[process]] which it would [[repeat]] at regular intervals for the next 18 years. This [[period]] also saw deployments to RAF [[Salalah]] and Hong Kong. In 1982 the [[squadron]] [[moved]] back to [[Catterick]] from Wittering to [[re-role]]. It emerged [[operating]] the [[Combat]] Vehicle [[Reconnaissance]] ([[tracked]]) family and in [[wartime]] it would have moved to [[Germany]] to defend [[airfields]] there. However its next [[war]] [[service]] was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. In aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the squadron deployed to Arabia and detachments saw service at [[Dharan]], [[Muharraq]] and [[Tabuk]] during the war. Following the Options for Change defence cuts the [[squadron]] was disbanded in [[1993]]. The dawn of a [[new]] [[century]] saw a return to active [[service]] for the squadron. Once again operating in a [[field]] [[squadron]] role, it [[reformed]] at RAF Honington in 2001 before [[moving]] to RAF Lossiemouth. It was not long before war [[beckoned]] again and the [[squadron]] was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. [[Following]] the invasion it has taken part in roulements back to the region.

In 1996, the [[Dah‚Öºe]] brothers [[release‘Å]] an album with their side project [[Limblfiter]], which was also [[commercial‚Öºy]] [[successfu‚Öº]] in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \""Remote Control\"", which peaked at No. 9 on [[Cana‘Åa's]] Singles Chart and was later featured on [[Much]] [[Music's]] diamond certified compilation [[albuÔΩç]], Big Shiny [[Tune—ï]] 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the [[ban‘Å]] led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for [[Or]] Lady [[Peaœ≤e]]. Upon the [[break-p]] of Age of [[Electriœ≤]], the brothers [[Kens]] [[woul‘Å]] go on to [[forÔΩç]] Static in Stereo with other [[member—ï]] including their brother Ryan.

"[[The]] Arab‚Äì[[Khazar]] wars were a series of [[conflicts]] fought between the armies of the [[Khazar]] Khaganate and the Umayyad Caliphate (as well as its Abbasid successor) and their respective vassals. [[Historians]] usually distinguish [[two]] major periods of conflict, the First (—Åa. 642‚Äì[[652]]) and Second (ca. [[722]]‚Äì[[737]]) Arab‚Äì[[Khazar]] Wars, but the Arab‚ÄìKhazar [[military]] confrontation [[involved]] several sporadic raids and isolated clashes as well, over a period from the middle of the 7th century to the end of the 8th century. The Arab‚ÄìKhazar [[wars]] were a result of the [[attempts]] of the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate to secure control of Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, where the Khazars were already established. The [[first]] Arab [[invasion]], in the 640s and [[early]] 650s, ended with the [[defeat]] of an Arab [[force]] [[led]] by [[Abd]] [[ar-Rahman]] ibn [[Rabiah]] [[outside]] the Khazar town of Balanjar. [[Hostilities]] broke out again with the Caliphate in the 710s, with raids [[back]] and forth across the Caucasus. [[Led]] by the [[distinguished]] generals [[al-Jarrah]] [[ibn]] Abdallah and [[Maslama]] ibn [[Abd]] [[al-Malik]], the Arabs were able to [[capture]] Derbent and even the southern Khazar capital of Balanjar, but this had little impact on the nomadic [[Khazars]], who [[remained]] able to launch [[devastating]] raids [[deep]] into [[Transcaucasia]]. In one such raid in 730, the [[Khazars]] inflicted a major defeat on the [[Umayyad]] [[forces]] at the Battle of [[Ardabil]], killing [[al-Jarrah]], but were in turn defeated the next year and pushed [[back]] north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab [[military]] outpost and colony, before being [[replaced]] by Marwan ibn [[Muhammad]] (the future caliph [[Marwan]] II) in [[732]]. A period of [[relatively]] [[localized]] warfare followed until [[737]], when [[Marwan]] led [[north]] a massive [[expedition]] that reached the Khazar capital Atil on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the khagan, the Arabs withdrew. The 737 campaign marked the end of large-scale warfare between the two [[powers]], establishing Derbent as the northernmost Muslim outpost and securing Muslim [[dominance]] over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the long wars weakened the Umayyad [[army]] and contributed to the eventual fall of the [[dynasty]] to the Abbasid Revolution a few years later. Relations between the Muslims of the Caucasus and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure a marriage alliance between the Arab governors or local princes of the Caucasus and the Khazar khagan. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the local Muslim principalities of the Caucasus until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.","[[T]] [[he]] Arab‚Äì[[Khaza‚≤Ö]] wars were a series of [[conflict—ï]] fought between the armies of the [[Khaza‚≤Ö]] Khaganate and the Umayyad Caliphate (as well as its Abbasid successor) and their respective vassals.

"The USA Rink Hockey National Championship is the biggest Roller Hockey [[Clubs]] Championship in United States. Unfortunately, the sport in the U.S. is largely owned by roller rink operators. The sport suffers stateside since players are mostly made up of operator's family members and a gaggle of childhood friends. Since the sport transitioned to the United States in the 1960s, teams and players competing in the United States have waned as roller rinks continue to close nationwide. Often teams are completed by tapping skaters from ice or inline hockey who are willing to give it a go and round out teams at U.S. nationals; many playing on inline skates. The sport is struggling in the U.S. due to the lack of real public access to the sport found in other countries where the sport continues to grow. In contrast to other countries, the U.S. players and teams are managed and vetted by roller rink operators and their families. This practice explains the recurring players, teams, and regions who compete each year, and the loss of total number of teams since the 1960s and '70s.","The USA Rink Hockey National Championship is the biggest Roller Hockey [[C‚Öºubs]] Championship in United States.
