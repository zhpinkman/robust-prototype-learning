The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

At stake were all 45 seats in the General Junta, determining the President of the [[Principality]] of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983.

FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture voting of √Ålvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive [[proto-heavy]] metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the [[group's]] development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. [[Reinterest]] in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of [[Yesterday's]] Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"William Harold [[Lee]] ([[December]] 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and [[later]] the [[chief]] [[architect]] for Eastern [[College]].

"[[Perfect]] [[Records]] was a [[United]] [[States-based]] record [[label]] founded in 1922 by Path√© Records to [[produce]] cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the [[era]]. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better [[records]] can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill [[Broonzy]], [[Cab]] [[Calloway]], Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, [[Cliff]] \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day.

Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the [[ea]]. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better [[record—ï]] can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill [[Boronzy]], [[Cb]] [[Callowy]], Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, [[Clifùöè]] \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day.

"(148209) 2000 [[CR105]], also written as ([[148209]]) [[2000]] CR105, is the [[tenth-most-distant]] known [[object]] in the [[Solar]] System as of [[2015]]. Considered a detached [[object]], it [[orbits]] the Sun in a highly [[eccentric]] [[orbit]] every [[3305]] years at an average [[distance]] of 222 [[astronomical]] units (AU). [[Mike]] [[Brown's]] [[website]] lists it as a possible [[dwarf]] [[planet]] with a [[diameter]] of 328 kilometres ([[204]] [[mi]]) based on an assumed [[albedo]] of [[0]].[[04]]. The [[albedo]] is [[expected]] to be [[low]] because the [[object]] has a blue (neutral) color. However, if the [[albedo]] is higher, the [[object]] could easily be half that size. ([[148209]]) [[2000]] CR105 and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not [[within]] the [[gravitational]] influence of the planet Neptune even at their [[perihelion]] distances ([[closest]] approaches to the Sun). It is something of a mystery as to how these [[objects]] came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been [[put]] forward: \[[n*]]  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and [[as-yet-undiscovered]] (albeit unlikely), giant [[planet]]. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an undiscovered companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a star like the Sun had an early close encounter and a 1% probability that outer planetary [[exchanges]] would have happened. ([[148209]]) 2000 CR105 is estimated to be 2‚Äì3 times more likely to be a captured planetary object than Sedna.

Considered a detached [[objecùöù]], it [[orbit—ï]] the Sun in a highly [[eccentriœ≤]] [[orbiùöù]] every [[330∆º]] years at an average [[distanœ≤e]] of 222 [[astronomica‚Öº]] units (AU). [[Miùíåe]] [[Brown'—ï]] [[websiùöùe]] lists it as a possible [[dwarùöè]] [[planeùöù]] with a [[diamete‚≤Ö]] of 328 kilometres ([[20·èé]] [[ÔΩçi]]) based on an assumed [[abledo]] of [[O]].[[0·èé]]. The [[albe‘Åo]] is [[expecte‘Å]] to be [[lo‘ù]] because the [[objecùöù]] has a blue (neutral) color. However, if the [[abledo]] is higher, the [[objecùöù]] could easily be half that size.

It is something of a mystery as to how these [[object—ï]] came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been [[puùöù]] forward: \[[’∏*]]  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and [[as-yetÀóundiscovered]] (albeit unlikely), giant [[pl…ënet]]. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an undiscovered companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a star like the Sun had an early close encounter and a 1% probability that outer planetary [[exchange—ï]] would have happened. ([[14820‡ß≠]]) 2000 CR105 is estimated to be 2‚Äì3 times more likely to be a captured planetary object than Sedna.

[[Hops]] Infusion is one of the [[bitterest]] examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Blithering]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

The [[supergroup]] includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, [[washboard]]), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a [[then-unknown]] Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.","The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[b…ënd]].

[[The]] [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a [[sixteen-year-old]] high school boy who is a [[psychic]] of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always [[come]] [[true]]. As he grows older and [[enters]] junior high, he has fewer [[foreseeing]] dreams and they also become [[weaker]]. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest [[foreseeing]] dream he has ever had.

From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as [[reading]] porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the [[culminating]] point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the [[former]] empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I ([[13th]] century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the [[large]] part of territories of this kingdom between his [[allies]]. The rest of what had been the empire of [[Mitanni]] retained its independence as a Hittite [[vassal]] state [[called]] [[·∏™anigalbat]]. During the reign of the [[Hittite]] [[king]] Mursili [[III]] ([[better]] known as [[Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub]]), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the [[Euphrates]]. Hence, when ·∏™attusili III ousted his [[nephew]] Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of ·∏™anigalbat to the [[Assyrians]] despite its former status as a [[Hittite]] [[vassal]] state. (i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait [[accompli]]) The [[Assyrian]] involvement in [[Syria]] continued under the command of [[king]] Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with [[·∏™atti]]. The [[Hittites]] considered Assyrian involvement to be a [[clear]] attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: [[Tud·∏´alia]] IV, [[·∏™attusili's]] son and successor. This led to a major battle which is [[known]] today as the Battle of [[Ni·∏´riya]]. A letter (RS [[34]].[[265]]) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit.

When ≈†uppiluliuma I ([[13ùöùh]] century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the [[la‚≤Öge]] part of territories of this kingdom between his [[allie—ï]].

During the reign of the [[Hittie]] [[ùíåing]] Mursili [[II]] ([[bette‚≤Ö]] known as [[Uri·∏´-Te≈°ub]]), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the [[Euphates]].

(i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait [[acompli]]) The [[Assy‚≤Öian]] involvement in [[Sy‚≤Öia]] continued under the command of [[ùíåing]] Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with [[·∏™ati]]. The [[Hittiets]] considered Assyrian involvement to be a [[clea‚≤Ö]] attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: [[T]] [[ud·∏´alia]] IV, [[·∏™attusili`s]] son and successor. This led to a major battle which is [[kno‘ùn]] today as the Battle of [[Ni·∏´rya]].

"The Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system.

"The 1904‚Äì05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904‚Äì05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this [[season]], the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match [[season]]. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"". Events surrounding the February 1905 match with Aston Villa highlighted the Coventry Road ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported \""a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their freights at Muntz Street every two or three minutes.\"" Inside, \""the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution\"", and children were passed overhead and placed on the pitch for their own safety.

The tour to promote it was released as The [[Tokyo]] Showdown (2001) live album, which also charted in Sweden and Finland, breaking the top 40.

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

"Elisaeus Adougan was a [[late]] [[14th]] [[century]] and early 15th [[century]] [[Scottish]] [[cleric]]. [[His]] [[name]] has been [[said]] to have [[occurred]] for the first time in a papal [[letter]] datable to 25 November 1390, but this [[letter]] is simply a repetition of another [[addressed]] to him, dated [[2]] [[August]] that [[year]]; both [[letters]] address him as the [[rector]] of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of [[Lincluden]] [[providing]] he resigned Kirkmahoe [[within]] a period of [[two]] years. This [[Collegiate]] Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement [[VII]]. [[Papal]] authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese [[Lincluden]] lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors [[founded]] and built the monastery of [[Lincluden]], O. [[CLUN]]., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a [[prioress]], while right of patronage remained with the lords of [[Galloway]] ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and [[decline]], details [[provided]] to the [[papacy]] by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these [[facts]] be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ... He still held both [[Lincluden]] and Kirkmahoe on 17 May [[1391]], when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral. [[Elisaeus]] retained his position as provost of [[Lincluden]] until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway.

"[[The]] [[2007]] Rugby [[World]] Cup [[Final]] was a rugby union match, played on [[Saturday]], [[20]] [[October]] 2007 at the [[Stade]] de France, [[Saint-Denis]], [[Paris]].

"St [[Reims]] ([[foaled]] 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a [[thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002. A million-dollar yearling, big things were always expected of the son of Zabeel, and although he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon started to live up to expectations. A runaway win in the Avondale Guineas at his last start before the Derby ensured that he would start favourite in the Classic, and he didn't disappoint. Given an excellent ride out in front by Greg Childs, the colt was never headed and scored a narrow but authoritative win. After the Derby his career went downhill. After disappointing performances in an autumn Sydney campaign, St Reims failed to win a single race as a four-year-old and looked to be a shadow of his former self. But at Hastings in the spring of 2004 he regained his interest in racing and put together a string of wins against horses the quality of Waitoki Dream and Zafar, culminating in a return to Group race success in the Lindauer Grandeur Stakes at Ellerslie, the scene of his Derby triumph.

"The [[Irish]] Independence [[Party]] ([[IIP]]) was a nationalist political [[party]] in [[Northern]] Ireland, [[founded]] in October 1977 by [[Frank]] [[McManus]] (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & [[South]] Tyrone between [[1970]] and 1974) and Fergus McAteer ([[son]] of Eddie [[McAteer]], who had been leader of the [[Nationalist]] Party between 1953 and [[1969]]). [[The]] party was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence [[Association]]. The [[party]] first came to prominence by [[standing]] [[four]] candidates in the [[1979]] UK general election. [[Its]] best result came in the Mid [[Ulster]] constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,[[055]] [[votes]] (19%), however the [[main]] effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the [[SDLP]] from gaining the [[seat]]. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the [[Maze]] prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and [[later]] hunger [[strike]]. The [[IIP]] won [[21]] seats on councils in the [[local]] elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was [[fairly]] localised, with 17 of the [[21]] seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, [[Derry]], Omagh and [[Newry]] & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of [[Irish]] republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the [[People's]] Democracy and the [[Irish]] Republican [[Socialist]] [[Party]] securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the [[Assembly]] elections in October [[1982]], leaving the field clear for Sinn F√©in, who began [[standing]] candidates in elections in the early 1980s. As a result, the IIP lost [[republican]] support, for example in the [[first]] by-election in which Sinn F√©in stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to [[poll]] 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn F√©in candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate [[nationalists]] had remained with the SDLP.

The [[IP]] won [[·íø1]] seats on councils in the [[loca‚Öº]] elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was [[fair‚Öºy]] localised, with 17 of the [[·íø1]] seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, [[Der‚≤Öy]], Omagh and [[New‚≤Öy]] & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of [[Iri—ïh]] republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the [[People'—ï]] Democracy and the [[Iri—ïh]] Republican [[Soc—ñalist]] [[Praty]] securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the [[Assemb‚Öºy]] elections in October [[182]], leaving the field clear for Sinn F√©in, who began [[stan‘Åing]] candidates in elections in the early 1980s. As a result, the IIP lost [[republiœ≤an]] support, for example in the [[firsùöù]] by-election in which Sinn F√©in stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to [[p–æll]] 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn F√©in candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate [[n]] [[ationalists]] had remained with the SDLP.

"Rhobell Fawr is an extinct [[volcano]]  in the Arenig [[range]] within the Snowdonia [[National]] [[Park]].

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a [[satellite]] providing television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time.

"[[Presidential]] [[elections]] were held in [[France]] on [[24]] [[April]] and [[8]] [[May]] [[1988]]. In 1981, the [[Socialist]] Party leader, [[Fran√ßois]] Mitterrand, was elected [[President]] of [[France]] and the [[Left]] won the legislative [[election]]. However, in 1986, the right [[regained]] a [[parliamentary]] majority. [[President]] Mitterrand was [[forced]] to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR [[leader]] [[Jacques]] Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President [[focused]] on his \""reserved domain\"" ‚Äì foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates [[opposed]] the two heads of the executive. [[Chirac's]] cabinet advocated liberal-conservative policies, in [[abolishing]] the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by President [[Mitterrand]]. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was challenged by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", claiming that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth [[Republic]]\"". He appeared as an [[alternative]] to the executive [[duo]]. In January 1988, when he announced his candidacy, Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by [[SOFRES]] polls institute, against 23% for Barre. But, from the start of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and took the lead among the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist candidate was uncertain. Mitterrand said he was not sure he would run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel Rocard campaigned for the nomination. The favourite to win the [[election]] according to the polls, the [[incumbent]] [[president]] announced his candidacy at the end of March. He wrote an open letter to the French, where he proposed a moderate [[programme]] (\""neither nationalisations, nor privatizations\"") and advocated a \""[[united]] France\"" against \""the appropriation of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the [[RPR]]. He benefited from the decline of the [[French]] Communist [[Party]], represented by Andr√© Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \""reforming Communist\"", Pierre Juquin and a [[Trotskyist]], Arlette [[Laguiller]]. Meanwhile, the [[Ecologist]] Antoine Waechter [[refused]] to [[ally]] the [[Greens]] with [[either]] the left or the right.

"The Vancouver [[Dragons]] were a [[professional]] [[basketball]] team in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, [[CEO]] of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman [[negotiated]] a [[three-year]] lease with the [[Pacific]] [[National]] Exhibition in Vancouver, British [[Columbia]] to [[play]] 24 home games each [[year]] in the 4,[[500-seat]] Agrodome in [[2006]]. That same year, [[Vancouver]] was [[awarded]] the 2010 Winter [[Olympics]] and the [[Dragon's]] [[lease]] was [[deferred]] until the conclusion of the games due to the high [[demand]] for indoor [[sports]] [[facilities]] in the run-up to the [[Olympics]].

In a 2006 [[interview]] with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most [[international]] players had [[single-entrance]] visas, which meant that if they left the [[United]] States to play a game in Canada, they could not [[return]] to the U.S. [[The]] Dragons were [[initially]] slated to [[play]] in the [[ABA]] along with [[Tuckman's]] other teams.

Tuckman [[negotiate‘Å]] a [[t’∞ree-year]] lease with the [[Pacifiœ≤]] [[Nationa‚Öº]] Exhibition in Vancouver, British [[ColuÔΩçbia]] to [[p‚Öºay]] 24 home games each [[yer]] in the 4,[[500-seaùöù]] Agrodome in [[206]]. That same year, [[Vancouve‚≤Ö]] was [[awarde‘Å]] the 2010 Winter [[Olympic—ï]] and the [[Drag–æn's]] [[lea—ïe]] was [[deferr–µd]] until the conclusion of the games due to the high [[deman‘Å]] for indoor [[sorts]] [[facilitie—ï]] in the run-up to the [[Olympic—ï]]. In [[·íø001]], [[Tuckan]] proposed a $[[10]] [[mil‚Öºion]] [[sorts]] arena and performing arts center [[projecùöù]] to the city [[counci‚Öº]] of [[Belle—µue]], Washington, an [[affluenùöù]] [[Settle]] [[subu‚≤Öb]], to be built on three [[acre—ï]] of city-owned land [[downto‘ùn]]. [[Tuck]] [[man]] needed [[sport—ï]] tenants to sign [[longÀóterm]] leases in order to [[obùöùain]] financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a [[C]] [[BA]] expansion franchise for [[Belle—µue]] to [[becoÔΩçe]] an [[ancho‚≤Ö]] [[tenanùöù]]. [[Te]] league gave [[Tuckan]] permission to [[p‚Öºay]] at nearby [[Belle—µue]] Community College for three [[year—ï]] while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the [[Meyden]] [[bauer]] Convention Center. When it was [[determi’∏ed]] that BCC would not be a [[suitab‚Öºe]] venue for [[p‚≤Öo]] basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the [[nme]] to the [[Dragon—ï]]. In a 2006 [[intervie‘ù]] with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most [[internationa‚Öº]] players had [[single-entranœ≤e]] visas, which meant that if they left the [[Unite‘Å]] States to play a game in Canada, they could not [[retu‚≤Ön]] to the U.S. [[Te]] Dragons were [[initial‚Öºy]] slated to [[p‚Öºay]] in the [[AA]] along with [[Tuckman'—ï]] other teams.

"The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], Switzerland and, [[formerly]], in [[Germany]]) or [[ICE]] ([[German]] pronunciation: [[[iÀêtseÀêÀà îeÀê]]]) is a [[system]] of [[high-speed]] trains predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service [[category]] offered by DB [[Fernverkehr]] and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the [[best-known]] in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001‚Äì2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Li√®ge and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam.

"The Cimmeron Show Review was originally a 1960s Revival [[Band]] [[originating]] in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA in 1972. The group originally consisted of four University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh students, Phil Barry, Scott Nelson, Gregg Tipple, and R.B.Smith.

Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow. With some creative marketing, they became a headliner band in a very short period of time. They had a large fan base and enjoyed considerable popularity in the Midwest from 1972 through 1979.

The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District. For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified.
