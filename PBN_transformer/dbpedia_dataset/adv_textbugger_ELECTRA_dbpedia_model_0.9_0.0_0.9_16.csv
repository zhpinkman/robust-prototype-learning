"On 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"[[Russells]] [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] [[located]] in [[Dudley]], [[West]] [[Midlands]], England, [[run]] by [[The]] Dudley [[Group]] [[NHS]] [[Foundation]] [[Trust]]. [[The]] [[hospital]] is situated [[south-west]] of the [[town]] centre on the A4101 [[road]], which [[connects]] to the [[Kingswinford]] [[area]] of the borough. [[It]] was [[first]] planned in the [[1960s]] as a [[general]] [[hospital]] for [[Dudley]] and the surrounding [[area]]. [[The]] first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in [[1976]] as a [[laundry]] [[centre]] for the [[borough's]] [[hospitals]], and the [[general]] hospital [[buildings]] were built within the [[next]] five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to [[patients]] until [[March]] [[1984]], [[becoming]] fully operational in [[May]] that [[year]]. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and [[emergency]] unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the [[NHS]] [[first]] began to consider the [[closure]] of Dudley [[Guest]] [[Hospital]]. In 1992, [[plans]] were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and [[Dudley]] [[Guest]] hospitals, as well as [[parts]] of the [[Corbett]] Hospital. [[There]] was much protest against this, and over the [[next]] few years there were several [[amendments]] to the [[proposals]] - including a [[move]] which [[would]] have [[seen]] Wordsley [[Hospital]] [[keep]] its maternity [[services]] but for all other services to relocate to [[Russells]] Hall.

[[The]] first phases of the work were [[completed]] in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing [[hospital]] was also refurbished. The [[Princess]] Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 ‚Äì 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the [[completion]] of the expanded [[hospital]] and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley [[town]] [[centre]] - Kingswinford [[Road]] - was widened into a dual [[carriageway]] in 2003.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"The [[Grand]] Rapids Hotel also [[known]] as the The Grand Rapids [[Resort]], was a [[hotel]] that existed outside of Mount Carmel, Illinois in Wabash County, Illinois, United [[States]] in [[Southern]] Illinois from 1922 to 1929. The hotel was located on the Wabash River next to the Grand Rapids Dam on land that was originally purchased by Thomas S. Hinde. Before the hotel was built, the property where the hotel was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman for multiple [[small]] shops that sold goods to fisherman and tourists. Frederick Hinde Zimmerman was the founder and owner of the hotel, and he completed construction and opened the hotel to the public on August 7, 1922. [[The]] hotel had 36 rooms and one large assembly room that served as a dining [[room]], [[meeting]] hall, and was used for weddings, exhibitions, anniversaries, and other important occasions. [[The]] hotel was one of the [[first]] [[major]] [[resorts]] on the [[southern]] portion of the Wabash River and [[quickly]] was able to attract tourist from [[across]] the [[country]] because of its location on the river and ease of access provided by the railroad. During its [[9-year]] [[existence]] the hotel [[established]] a reputation for luxury and high quality.

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously [[known]] as the [[Million]] [[Dollar]] Challenge, is an [[annual]] men's [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] [[played]] at the [[Gary]] Player [[Country]] Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the major [[tours]], but it became an [[official]] tournament for the Sunshine [[Tour]] and [[European]] [[Tour]] in 2013. [[Like]] many high-profile unofficial tournaments in [[professional]] golf, it takes [[place]] between the [[conclusion]] of the [[PGA]] Tour in early [[November]], and Christmas. [[It]] usually attracts [[many]] of the world's highest ranked [[players]]. [[The]] tournament was a 12-player [[invitational]] [[stroke]] [[play]] event, with the field being made up of [[defending]] [[champion]], the [[Sunshine]] [[Tour]] [[order]] of merit winner, the [[four]] [[major]] [[winners]] and then [[completed]] with the [[top]] [[players]] in the [[Official]] [[World]] [[Golf]] [[Rankings]] [[following]] the U.S. [[PGA]] [[Championship]]. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since [[1999]]. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the [[defending]] tournament [[champion]]; the [[top]] 10 PGA [[Tour]] FedEx [[Cup]] [[players]], the top 10 European [[Tour]] Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine [[Tour]], [[Asian]] [[Tour]], Japan [[Golf]] [[Tour]] and PGA [[Tour]] of Australasia Order of [[Merit]] [[winners]]; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the [[top]] 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%.

"Pandora (/p√¶nÀàd…î…ôr…ô/ pan-DOHR-…ô; Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œéœÅŒ±) is an inner [[satellite]] of [[Saturn]]. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the [[Voyager]] 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S [[26]]. In late 1985 it was officially [[named]] after [[Pandora]] from Greek mythology. [[It]] is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, [[recent]] [[studies]] indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only [[Prometheus]], the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than [[nearby]] Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 [[kilometres]] (19 mi) in [[diameter]]. The [[majority]] of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's [[surface]]. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi).

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de [[Flor]] to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost.

"90377 Sedna is a large [[minor]] planet in the [[outer]] [[reaches]] of the [[Solar]] System that was, as of [[2015]], at a distance of about 86 [[astronomical]] [[units]] (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune.

In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the [[…°rape]] began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares). Today there are renewed efforts by Tuscan winemakers to find better clonal selections and re-introduce the [[vraiety]] into popular usage. A white sub-variety exist, known as Canaiolo bianco, which is a permitted grape variety in the Umbrian wine region of Orvieto where is known as Drupeggio. In recent years plantings have been declining.",3

In 1967 he produced a [[collection]] inspired by the Common [[Market]], which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe.

"Ascomycota is a [[division]] or [[phylum]] of the [[kingdom]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the [[subkingdom]] [[Dikarya]]. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""[[ascus]]\"" (from Greek: [[·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ]] ([[askos]]), [[meaning]] \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which [[nonmotile]] spores, called [[ascospores]], are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form [[asci]] or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphological]] or [[physiological]] similarities to [[ascus-bearing]] taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a [[monophyletic]] group, i.[[e]]. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. [[This]] group is of particular relevance to [[humans]] as sources for [[medicinally]] [[important]] compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, [[alcoholic]] beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and [[baker's]] yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the [[majority]] of lichens (loosely termed \""[[ascolichens]]\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery [[mildews]]. Several species of ascomycetes are biological model [[organisms]] in laboratory research. Most famously, [[Neurospora]] [[crassa]], several species of yeasts, and [[Aspergillus]] species are [[used]] in [[many]] genetics and cell biology [[studies]]. [[Penicillium]] species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial infectious diseases are examples of taxa that belong to the Ascomycota.","Ascomycota is a [[divisi–æn]] or [[—Ähylum]] of the [[kingdoÔΩç]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the [[subking]] [[dom]] [[Dik]] [[arya]].

"[[Federal]] [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 [[May]] [[1928]]. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann M√ºller. Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul [[Von]] Hindenburg for emergency [[powers]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by [[Medeski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the [[Jam]] Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the [[Assyrians]] for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

[[The]] line was part of a [[400-mile]] ([[640]] km) main line between Hoboken, [[New]] Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.[[5]] miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

"The [[Taradale]] [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought [[iron]] box [[girder]] bridge over [[Back]] Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the [[Bendigo]] Railway in [[Victoria]] [[Australia]]. It was erected as part of the [[Melbourne]], Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the [[time]] one of the [[largest]] [[rail]] [[bridges]] built in [[Australia]]. Construction of the [[Bendigo]] [[line]] commenced under the [[Melbourne]], Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this [[private]] [[consortium]] met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian [[Railways]] Department. The design work was then taken over by [[Captain]] [[Andrew]] [[Clarke]], R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge [[designs]] completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for ¬£3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O‚ÄôHara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways.

"The SM [[Kirov]] [[Stadium]] was a [[multi-purpose]] [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest [[stadiums]] anywhere in the world. The [[stadium]] was [[named]] after [[Sergey]] Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov [[stadium]] was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more [[years]] for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit [[Stadium]] was won by architect Kisho [[Kurokawa]]. The Kirov [[stadium]] was the [[home]] to Zenit football [[club]] in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo [[Moscow]] at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit [[ground]]. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out [[stadium]]. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006. A new stadium (see New Zenit Stadium) is under construction, tentatively scheduled to open in 2016.","The SM [[Kiro—µ]] [[Stdium]] was a [[multi-purpo—ïe]] [[stadiuÔΩç]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest [[stadium—ï]] anywhere in the world.

The album was accompanied by the band's first single, \""Cloud Connected\"", but failed to chart. In 2003, In Flames released Trigger, an EP that features the title track backed with a remix, a cover of Genesis' \""Land of Confusion\"", and two music videos. It was followed by Soundtrack to Your Escape in 2004, which peaked at number 3 in Sweden, and number 7 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. The album produced a single for \""The Quiet Place\"", which followed the success of the album and reached number 2 in their home country. Used & Abused: In Live We Trust (2005), was the band's debut video album, and their first release to top the Swedish chart. Following the same blueprint, Come Clarity (2006) topped the Finnish and Swedish charts, and reached number 2 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums, number 6 in Germany, as well as the top 30 in three additional European countries. The album was backed by the single \""Come Clarity\"", which was released in a limited edition that reached number 52 in their home country. Before they released their ninth studio album, In Flames issued the single \""The Mirror's Truth\"", which peaked at number 5 in Finland. Their ninth studio album, A Sense of Purpose (2008), topped the Swedish and Billboard Independent Albums charts, and reached top 10 in Austria, Finland, and Germany. In Flames were featured on Pendulum's 2010 album Immersion, on a song called \""Self vs Self\"". In Flames signed with Century Media after completing their recording contract with Nuclear Blast in 2011. Sounds of a Playground Fading was then issued as the band's tenth studio album, peaking at number 1 in Germany. It debuted and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200, becoming their highest charting album in the United States, with a single, \""Where the Dead Ships Dwell\"", reaching number 35 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.",1

"The [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] landslide [[dam]] along the [[Murghab]] [[River]] in [[Tajikistan]]. At 567 metres (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the [[tallest]] [[dam]] in the world, [[either]] natural or [[man-made]]. The [[dam]] was [[created]] on [[February]] 18, 1911, when the 7.[[4-Ms]] [[Sarez]] [[earthquake]] caused a massive landslide that [[blocked]] the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is [[formed]] of approximately 2 cubic kilometres ([[0]].48 cu mi) of [[rock]] dislodged from the [[steeply]] sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the [[1911]] landslide. The [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 [[metres]] ([[1]],600 to [[2]],300 ft) from the original valley floor. The [[basin]] formed by [[Usoi]] Dam now [[holds]] Sarez Lake, a 55.[[8-kilometre]] (34.[[7]] mi)-[[long]] [[lake]] [[holding]] 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,[[031]],[[000]] [[acre]]¬∑ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the dam, which [[would]] [[quickly]] cause it to [[erode]] away; instead, [[water]] seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which [[approximately]] matches the rate of [[inflow]], maintaining the lake at a [[relatively]] [[constant]] level. The [[flow]] averages about 45 [[cubic]] [[meters]] [[per]] second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the Usoi [[Dam]] [[may]] [[become]] unstable during [[future]] [[large-magnitude]] earthquakes, which are [[relatively]] common in the seismically [[active]] Pamirs, and [[might]] [[collapse]] due to liquefaction or [[subsequent]] landslides during such an [[event]].

Lane six was also reversed prior to 1990 during the evening rush hour, giving a [[–±]] √ó 0 flow, but this no longer occurs because of changes made to the Warringah [[Feeway]] to accommodate the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. In August 1992, the [[Sy‘Åney]] Harbour Tunnel opened, which helped to [[relivee]] congestion on the Bradfield Highway.",2
