Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The [[match]] is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictionaⅼ]] [[characteⲅ]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"[[Iddo]] \""[[Snowy]]\"" [[Munro]] (26 [[March]] [[1888]] – 27 October 1980) was an [[Australian]] racing [[cyclist]]. The highlights of his career were winning the Australasian long distance road championship in 1909 and competing in the 1914 Tour de France. Munro won the championship by winning the Blue Riband for the fastest time in the Warrnambool to Melbourne race. Munro set a record time of 7h 12' 51\"" which was not broken until 1931. Munro had a long association with the Warrnambool and his other efforts were 30th in 1907, 45th and fastest rider receiving over 10 minute start in 1908  and 60th in 1910. In 1914, Munro and Don Kirkham were the first Australian cyclists to compete in the Tour de France. Munro finished 20th in the general classification and his best result was 10th in Stage 15. There was some confusion about his given name, with some contemporary newspaper reports referring to him as \""Ivor\"". In 1910 Munro won the Cycle Traders 100 a 100 miles (160 km) race in the record time of 5h 01' 07\"". In 1914 on his return from the Tour de France, Munro finished 14th and 2nd fastest in the Cycle Traders 100. Munro did not compete in 1912, having spent seven months traveling to England, France and America. His return to cycling in 1913 was successful, starting in four Victorian races between 25 and 80 miles finishing either first or fastest times in each with victories over top riders including twice defeating Don Kirkham. In 1915 Munro and others broke away from the League of Victorian Wheelmen to form the Victorian Racing Cyclists' Union  and competed at a meeting on 27 February 1915. As a consequence the League of Victorian Wheelmen disqualified those riders for twelve months from competing in races organised under the auspices of the League. After his retirement from cycling Munro drove a hire car  and would follow the Warrnambool race in his car. In 1931 Munro was said to have accurately predicted that his time would be easily broken because of the favorable conditions, a faster course than in 1909 and the use of singles. Munro died on 27 October 1980 after experiencing heart problems.","[[Idԁo]] \""[[Sno]] [[wy]]\"" [[Munⲅo]] (26 [[Marh]] [[188]] – 27 October 1980) was an [[Austⲅalian]] racing [[cyclis𝚝]].

"Pandora (/[[pænˈdɔərə]]/ pan-DOHR-ə; [[Greek]]: [[Πανδώρα]]) is an [[inner]] [[satellite]] of [[Saturn]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] in [[1980]] from [[photos]] taken by the [[Voyager]] 1 [[probe]], and was provisionally [[designated]] S/1980 S 26. In [[late]] [[1985]] it was [[officially]] named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is [[also]] [[designated]] as Saturn [[XVII]]. Pandora was [[thought]] to be an [[outer]] [[shepherd]] [[satellite]] of the F Ring. However, recent [[studies]] [[indicate]] that it does not play such a [[role]], and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the [[confinement]] of the [[narrow]] [[ring]]. It is more heavily [[cratered]] than nearby Prometheus, and has at [[least]] [[two]] large [[craters]] 30 [[kilometres]] (19 [[mi]]) in [[diameter]]. [[The]] majority of craters on [[Pandora]] are shallow as a result of being filled with [[debris]]. Ridges and grooves are [[also]] present on [[moon's]] [[surface]]. The [[orbit]] of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of [[four]] [[118]]:[[121]] mean-motion resonances with [[Prometheus]]. The most [[appreciable]] changes in their [[orbits]] [[occur]] [[approximately]] every [[6]].2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 [[kilometres]] ([[870]] [[mi]]). Pandora also has a [[3]]:[[2]] mean-motion resonance with [[Mimas]]. From its very [[low]] density and [[relatively]] high albedo, it [[seems]] likely that Pandora is a very [[porous]] [[icy]] body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these [[values]], however, so this remains to be confirmed.","Pandora (/[[рænˈdɔərə]]/ pan-DOHR-ə; [[Geek]]: [[Πανώδρα]]) is an [[inneⲅ]] [[satelli𝚝e]] of [[Satuⲅn]].

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before [[disbanding]]. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The [[league]] played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[band]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"". The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009.

And some members of the band started touring as Dead & Company in 2015. There have also been several spin-offs featuring band members, such as Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Hart and Kreutzmann.","The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[baոd]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"". The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995).

"[[The]] Arkansas [[RiverBlades]] was a [[short-lived]] [[minor-league]] ice hockey team located in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas [[RiverBlades]] was an expansion [[franchise]] that [[entered]] the East Coast [[Hockey]] [[League]] for the 1999–2000 season. [[Their]] home games were played at the newly opened [[ALLTEL]] Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. [[The]] ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena.

The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. [[Te]] ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan.

"Asia are a British progressive rock [[band]]. The band was formed in 1981 as a supergroup of four members from different progressive rock bands: John Wetton (former bassist/vocalist of bands including King Crimson, Family, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep, UK and Wishbone Ash), Steve Howe (guitarist of Yes), Geoff Downes (keyboardist of Yes and The Buggles) and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Atomic Rooster). With their debut album Asia from 1982 reaching No. 1 in several countries, Asia ranks as one of the most popular progressive rock bands in history. The band has undergone multiple line-up changes during its history, but in 2006, the original line-up reunited.

"[[Frederick]] [[Charles]] 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – November [[1972]]) was a Welsh professional footballer and Wales international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the [[rank]] of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four [[Welsh]] Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the [[side]] and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign. Keenor finished his career with spells at Crewe Alexandra, Oswestry Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 [[caps]] for the Wales national football team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three [[occasions]] in [[1920]], 1924 and 1928, and [[captained]] the [[side]] on [[numerous]] [[occasions]], scoring two [[goals]].

"[[The]] Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system.

His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to [[Christianity]] [[several]] times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to let him go. Finally, Demetrius was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully sang Christian hymns in his way), and publicly executed by beheading; it took three strokes, and his severed head and body, though ordered to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.","[[Sint]] [[Demetriuѕ]] the [[Neomartyⲅ]] ([[Grek]]: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο [[Ν]] [[έος]]) is an [[Orthoԁox]] [[Chris𝚝ian]] [[sain𝚝]], commemorated on 14 April in the Church of [[Greeϲe]].

"[[Ellis]] [[Edgar]] \""Puss\"" Achong (16 February 1904 – [[29]] [[August]] [[1986]]) was a [[sportsman]] from [[Trinidad]] and Tobago in the West Indies. He played cricket for the West Indies and was the first [[person]] of known [[Chinese]] [[descent]] to [[play]] in a [[Test]] match. [[Left-arm]] unorthodox spin ([[left-arm]] [[wrist]] spin) is sometimes known as \""slow [[left-arm]] chinaman\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was [[born]] in Belmont, Port of [[Spain]]. He played football as a left-winger for a local [[team]], [[Maple]], in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[represented]] [[Trinidad]] and Tobago from [[1919]] to [[1932]]. [[Achong]] is [[better]] known for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowler]]. [[His]] stock [[ball]] was left-arm [[orthodox]] [[spin]] ([[left-arm]] finger spin), but one of his variations was [[unorthodox]] [[left-arm]] spin. [[After]] bowling this variation to have [[Walter]] Robins stumped at [[Old]] Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that [[Robins]] said to the umpire Joe [[Hardstaff]] [[Sr]]., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Learie]] Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you [[mean]] the bowler or the ball?\"" An [[unorthodox]] [[left-arm]] [[spin]] delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a [[right-handed]] [[batsman]]) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. [[However]], Achong was not the earliest recorded [[Test]] match [[player]] to bowl unorthodox [[left-arm]] spin – that is believed to be Charles [[Llewellyn]] of [[South]] Africa. Achong [[played]] in six Test matches for the West Indies against the [[English]] cricket [[team]] from [[1930]] to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the [[1933]] tour of [[England]]. In all, Achong [[took]] eight [[Test]] wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test [[figures]] belie his [[much]] [[greater]] [[success]] at regional [[level]] in the West Indies between [[1929]]–30 and [[1934]]–[[35]]. In the final of the [[Inter-Colonial]] Tournament of [[1931]]–[[32]], he [[took]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to [[bowl]] Trinidad to victory over [[British]] Guiana. He married during the [[1933]] [[tour]] of [[England]] and [[settled]] in Manchester. [[After]] his [[last]] [[Test]] match, he [[continued]] to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,[[000]] wickets, [[including]] 10 in an innings for Burnley against [[Todmorden]] in [[1945]]. He [[returned]] to [[Trinidad]] and Tobago in [[1952]], and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

[[Afteⲅ]] bowling this variation to have [[Walteⲅ]] Robins stumped at [[Olԁ]] Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that [[Roins]] said to the umpire Joe [[Hardsaff]] [[Sⲅ]]., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Lear]] [[ie]] Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you [[ｍean]] the bowler or the ball?\"" An [[unorhodox]] [[lef𝚝-arm]] [[ѕpin]] delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a [[righ𝚝-handed]] [[batsｍan]]) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. [[Howeveⲅ]], Achong was not the earliest recorded [[Tes𝚝]] match [[playeⲅ]] to bowl unorthodox [[lef𝚝-arm]] spin – that is believed to be Charles [[Llеwellyn]] of [[Sou𝚝h]] Africa. Achong [[playeԁ]] in six Test matches for the West Indies against the [[Engliѕh]] cricket [[teaｍ]] from [[130]] to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the [[133]] tour of [[Englanԁ]]. In all, Achong [[too𝒌]] eight [[Tes𝚝]] wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test [[figureѕ]] belie his [[muϲh]] [[greateⲅ]] [[succesѕ]] at regional [[leveⅼ]] in the West Indies between [[192৭]]–30 and [[193Ꮞ]]–[[3Ƽ]]. In the final of the [[Inteⲅ-Colonial]] Tournament of [[131]]–[[3ᒿ]], he [[too𝒌]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to [[bowⅼ]] Trinidad to victory over [[Britiѕh]] Guiana. He married during the [[193]] [[touⲅ]] of [[Englanԁ]] and [[settleԁ]] in Manchester. [[Afteⲅ]] his [[las𝚝]] [[Tes𝚝]] match, he [[continueԁ]] to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,[[00]] wickets, [[incluԁing]] 10 in an innings for Burnley against [[Todmordeո]] in [[195]]. He [[retunred]] to [[Trinidaԁ]] and Tobago in [[1592]], and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply. Achong ultimately became a sports coach with the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education, coaching and selecting the Trinidad and Tobago cricket team. He died aged 82 in [[S𝚝]]. Augustine.",0

"[[Alan]] Dicks (born 29 August [[1934]]) is an English retired footballer and football [[manager]]. He [[managed]] Bristol City for thirteen years and managed clubs in four countries on three continents. Born in London, he signed for Chelsea at the age of 17, though his playing time in the first team was limited to 35 matches in six years, during this time he completed his two years national service with the RAF and so only played one game in Chelsea's 1954–55 championship season. In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in 1962 joined Coventry City as assistant manager/coach under Jimmy Hill. In 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City. He took the [[job]] at the [[age]] of just 33, and [[held]] it for thirteen [[years]]. In that [[time]] he consolidated City's position in the Second Division, and eventually, in 1976, led them to promotion to the First Division – then English football's top flight. During his spell as manager the club also made the semi-finals of the 1971 League Cup and won the 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Dicks remained as [[manager]] [[throughout]] City's four-year stay in [[Division]] 1, but relegation and a [[poor]] [[start]] to the following [[season]] saw him leave in October 1980. Subsequently, [[City]] suffered [[three]] relegations in as [[many]] [[years]].

After facing financial obstacles in getting their bands' music into stores, Drive-Thru entered into a distribution deal with MCA/Universal. MCA was dissolved and changed into Geffen Records.

"Nikolas Cassadine is a fictional [[character]] from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network. Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a recurring basis in honor of the soaps' fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular. Actor Nick Stabile took claim of the role in June 2016 in Christopher's absence. Created by head-writers Robert Guza, Jr. and Karen Harris and introduced by executive producer Wendy Riche in 1996 as the illegitimate son of Laura Spencer, the character was immediately popular with audiences. Hailed by Soap Opera Digest as the \""Best New Male Character\"" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the supercouple of Luke and Laura's happy life with their children, Lucky and Lulu. Luke immediately despises Nikolas due to his Cassadine heritage despite Nikolas saving an ailing Lulu's life. The misunderstood Nikolas is forced to grow up when his paternity comes into question and he is led to believe that his uncle Stefan is his father, as opposed to the late Stavros. Nikolas spends majority of his life trying to get out from under his family's treachery and become his own man. In addition to other romances, Nikolas is most known for his widely popular romance with Emily Quartermaine. Nikolas also has a son, Spencer named in honor of the Spencer family. The character was written out in 2011 following his disastrous affair with Lucky's longtime love, Elizabeth Webber. The character's 2013 return features the return of his biological father Stavros, and the ending of the war between the Cassadine and Spencer families. Nikolas also vies for Elizabeth's affection with A. J.

"[[The]] Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: [[Fornebubanen]]) is a [[proposed]] rail [[line]] which would [[serve]] the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, [[Norway]].

"The Algiers putsch (French: Putsch d'Alger or [[Coup]] d'État d'Alger), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des généraux), was a [[failed]] coup [[d'état]] to [[overthrow]] French [[President]] [[Charles]] de Gaulle and [[establish]] a military junta.

AOE were a commercially successful Canadian rock band of the mid-90s. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995. In 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with their side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \""Remote Control\"", which peaked at No. 9 on Canada's Singles Chart and was later featured on MuchMusic's diamond certified compilation album, Big Shiny Tunes 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace.

During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits. Miles' storylines have often centred on his friendships and romantic relationships with other characters. He has become a surrogate father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her.

"The [[2007]] Rugby World Cup [[Final]] was a rugby union match, played on Saturday, 20 October 2007 at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, Paris. The [[match]] determined the winner of the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the de facto world champions for the next four years. The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa, who had each won their semi-finals against France and Argentina respectively. The final was refereed by Irish referee Alain Rolland. The two finalists had met earlier in the competition, during the pool stage, when South Africa won 36–0, so South Africa began the final as the only undefeated team left in the competition. Had England won the competition, they would have become not only the first nation to retain the Rugby World Cup, which they had won in 2003, but the only team to win a final after having lost a game at the pool stage. Winners South Africa became the second country to win two titles, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999. The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. This gave South Africa a 15–6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try and also not conceded a try in the final. Each team did have one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second. England wing Mark Cueto was controversially denied a try in the 42nd minute after he was ruled to have put a foot in touch during a tackle by Danie Rossouw before grounding the ball.

He is on the air on weekday evenings from 7 pm to midnight, Central Time, on WSM. WSM's powerful nighttime clear channel signal allows WSM to be heard in a large part of the US and Canada. As a result, Stubbs has many regular listeners in all parts of the US and Canada in areas far away from Nashville.

"The USA Rink Hockey National Championship is the biggest Roller Hockey Clubs Championship in [[United]] [[States]]. Unfortunately, the sport in the U.S. is largely owned by roller rink operators. The sport suffers stateside since players are mostly made up of operator's family members and a gaggle of childhood friends. Since the sport transitioned to the United States in the 1960s, teams and players competing in the United States have waned as roller rinks continue to close nationwide. Often teams are completed by tapping skaters from ice or inline hockey who are willing to give it a go and round out teams at U.S. nationals; many playing on inline skates. The sport is struggling in the U.S. due to the lack of real public access to the sport found in other countries where the sport continues to grow. In contrast to other countries, the U.S. players and teams are managed and vetted by roller rink operators and their families. This practice explains the recurring players, teams, and regions who compete each year, and the loss of total number of teams since the 1960s and '70s.","The USA Rink Hockey National Championship is the biggest Roller Hockey Clubs Championship in [[Unіted]] [[S𝚝ates]].

With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing [[seasons]], Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times.

The current format of the tournament involves 24 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the Naismith Trophy, first awarded in 1967.

"Luke Bernard James McAllister is a fictional [[character]] from the British [[soap]] opera Emmerdale, played by Noah Huntley. In his first year at Emmerdale he was simply a nice but naive character, but come 1994, his life in the Dales would take a turn for the worse. On 9 August 1994, the Dingle family arrived in Emmerdale, and on that very night during a rave, Ben Dingle started a fight with Luke, during which Ben inexplicably died. The rest of the Dingles believed that Ben had been murdered and proceeded to make Luke's life a living hell. It eventually emerged, however, that Ben was suffering from a heart defect. The Dingles refused to believe this however, theorising that the McAllisters had managed to hide evidence, considering that one of the doctors who examined Ben's body was Luke's father. A family feud between the Dingles and the McAllisters had officially begun. In early 1995, Luke fell, ironically, for Ben's sister Tina after meeting her at a dance. She revealed she was pregnant, much to the dismay of both families. They agreed on marriage on 20 July 1995, and just as it seemed that Luke was finally going to have a happy ending, Tina revealed to him and the wedding guests that she did not love him at all, there was no baby, and this was all in aid of revenge for Ben. Luke was left badly damaged by all this, and Tina made things worse by insulting him during the following week, until 1 August 1995 when he finally snapped, shoved Tina into Dave Glover's van and took her for an insane ride around Emmerdale. She then jumped from the van whilst it was travelling at high speed, just before Luke lost control of it and crashed into a tree. The van exploded, killing him instantly.","Luke Bernard James McAllister is a fictional [[characteⲅ]] from the British [[saop]] opera Emmerdale, played by Noah Huntley.
