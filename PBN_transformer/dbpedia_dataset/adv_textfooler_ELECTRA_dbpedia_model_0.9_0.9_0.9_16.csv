"[[The]] 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was held on Sunday, 22 [[May]] 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias.

"Our [[Boys]] was a boys' [[magazine]] published monthly by the Irish Christian Brothers in Ireland. The various Education Acts of the late 19th and early 20th century had created a market in Britain for magazines and periodicals which were also popular in Ireland.

It specialised in adventure stories, [[school]] stories and [[historical]] stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. It was sold through the Christian Brothers' [[schools]], as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie. Gerrit Van Gelderen provided articles on wildlife. William Hickey wrote the \""Murphy\"" series of school stories. Another contributor was novelist Una Troy.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions.

The Greater London [[Authority]] (GLA) is a top-tier administrative body for Greater London, England. It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax. The GLA is unique in the British local government system, in terms of structure, elections and selection of powers.

In 1993 the RFU decided to change the whole league structure, with a new national league (Courage Division League 4) replacing the old North / South regional system which would become the aforementioned Courage Division 5. This led to twelve out of thirteen teams in both Courage Division 4 regions dropping into Courage Division 5 while the league winners joined Courage Division 4 along with eight teams from Courage Division 3.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] Company is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into [[Blasphemy]]. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

"The [[Word]] is an American [[instrumental]]/sacred [[steel]]/[[gospel]] blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live [[concerts]], there is typically only one [[vocal]] microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

"[[The]] Battle of Niḫriya was the culminating [[point]] of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a [[railroad]] [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no [[railroad]] crossings at the time of its construction.

"[[The]] Taradale Viaduct is a [[large]] wrought iron [[box]] [[girder]] bridge over Back [[Creek]] at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo [[Railway]] in [[Victoria]] [[Australia]]. [[It]] was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the [[time]] one of the largest [[rail]] bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then [[taken]] over by [[Captain]] Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge [[designs]] [[completed]] by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, [[Wiltshire]], under the [[supervision]] of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. [[Urquhart]] Wednesday 25 [[September]] 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to [[Sandhurst]] (now Bendigo), was let to [[Cornish]] and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"".

[[His]] was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the [[intervals]] one of the largest [[trajectories]] bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then [[carried]] over by [[Frigate]] Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge [[constructed]] [[finalized]] by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, [[Cornwall]], under the [[oversee]] of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. [[Mackinnon]] Wednesday 25 [[August]] 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to [[Croydon]] (now Bendigo), was let to [[Dorset]] and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"".
