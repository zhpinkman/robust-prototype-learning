"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal [[Football]] [[Club]] in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","[[by]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal [[city]] [[s]] in a Football League First Division [[championship]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

(Mgmt) degree in Management Practice for practising senior executives was launched, with a curriculum based on action research principles. In 2015 Trinity Business School embarked on a high growth strategy that will more than double the size of the School and includes the development of new and existing programmes, as well as the construction of a cutting-edge building for the School (that will incorporate an Innovation and Entrepreneurship hub). The new business complex will open up onto Pearse Street on one side, helping to reinvigorate that street, and overlook the iconic Trinity rugby field on the other. The project is expected to be completed by early 2019. In the meantime, Trinity Business School is located on two sites, one at Aras an Phairsaigh, within the main Trinity campus and another at 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2. In 2015 and 2016 it began rolling out a series of pre-experience masters and advanced diploma programs in support of this growth plan",0

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"William Harold Lee ([[December]] 9, 1884 – [[February]] 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league.

Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[nba]] League.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries [[began]] a [[two-year]] pillage in revenge and crossed over to [[Thrace]] and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding [[occurred]]. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"Canaiolo (also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine [[grape]] grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany. Other regions with plantings of Canaiolo include Lazio, Marche and Sardegna. In Umbria a white berried mutation known as Canaiolo bianco exist. Together with Sangiovese and Colorino it is often used to create Chianti wine and is an important but secondary component of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares).

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the [[culminating]] point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the [[Hittite]] king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was [[conquered]] by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians [[controlled]] the East [[bank]] of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III [[ousted]] his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The [[Assyrian]] involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be [[wrong]].

"The 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the [[club]] entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March [[1905]], it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only [[major]] football club in the city since Birmingham [[St]] George's had folded in 1892, the club should be [[renamed]] Birmingham City F.C. [[The]] shareholders were not in favour, [[though]] they were [[prepared]] to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead.

In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the [[clubs]] entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March [[1900s]], it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only [[recognised]] football club in the city since Birmingham [[aston]] George's had folded in 1892, the club should be [[made]] Birmingham City F.C. [[the]] shareholders were not in favour, [[with]] they were [[keen]] to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead.

"[[The]] men's single sculls [[competition]] at the 2000 Summer Olympics in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta Centre.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland. Belfast Central Library houses a range of sections, including a lending library & Information and Business library still based in the original reading room. A Belfast, Ulster and Irish Department & Music Library on the top floor. It is a major provider of IT facilities on the ground floor providing free internet access.","Belfast Central Library is a public [[libraries]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland.

[[This]] Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O.

He still held both Lincluden and Kirkmahoe on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus retained his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II. In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.","[[st]] Adougan was a late 14th century and early 15th century Scottish cleric.

He still held both Lincluden and Kirkmahoe on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus retained his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II. In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.",0

"The Velvet Underground was an American rock [[band]] from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967. The provocative subject matter, musical experimentation, and often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music would prove influential in the development of punk rock and alternative music. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground are now recognized as among the most influential acts of the rock era for their integration of rock music with the avant-garde. Their 1967 debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico (featuring German singer and collaborator Nico) was called the \""most prophetic rock album ever made\"" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the \""100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"".

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky. In 1982, Ten Broeck was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.","Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[thoroughbred]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks.

Its flagship publication is a quarterly print magazine/journal, also called The Lifted Brow, which is read all around the world - according to the publications website. Established in 2007 by Ronnie Scott, and run since early 2012 by Sam Cooney along with a large team, the print magazine/journal The Lifted [[eyebrow]] can also be read online and via an iOS app. The Lifted Brow is currently [[organised]] by Ellena Savage and Gillian Terzis, with a large [[publishing]] and support team. The Lifted Brow also publishes original content regularly on its website focussing on two major areas: social commentary, and literary criticism and discussion. Loosely falling under the literary [[books]] category, the print [[issue]] publishes longform non-fiction and fiction, flash fiction, [[novel]], criticism, poetry, as well as artwork, drawings, comics, and music; it has long been [[called]] \""uncategorisable\"". [[early]] versions of the publication were perfect-bound journal [[publication]], and then in tabloid newsprint [[formats]], before [[migrating]] to the high-quality matte magazine format that is currently published four times annually. For a few years editions of The Lifted Brow included an arts and cultural lift-out called \""Middlebrow\"", which featured film, book, and television reviews, and articles profiling new video games, theatre, and music. Some editions have been themed; themes have included 'Food', 'Sex', 'Music', 'Medicine', 'Art', 'Ego', 'Perth', and 'David Foster Wallace'.

"[[Free]] Society (1895-1897 as The Firebrand; 1897-1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist [[newspaper]] in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Most anarchist [[publications]] in the US were in Yiddish, German, or Russian, but [[Free]] Society was published in English, permitting the dissemination of anarchist thought to English-speaking populations in the US. The newspaper was established as The Firebrand in 1895 in Portland, Oregon by the Isaak [[family]], Abraham Isaak, Mary Isaak, and their [[children]], along with some associates; the organization served as \""the headquarters of anarchist [[activity]] on the [West] [[Coast]]\"". The paper was particularly known for its [[advocacy]] of free love and women's rights, bringing an anarchist [[critique]] to bear on social and gender relations. Deliberately defying the Comstock laws in an [[act]] of civil disobedience, The Firebrand published Walt Whitman's \""A [[Woman]] [[Waits]] for Me\"" in 1897; A.[[J]]. Pope, Abe [[Isaak]], and Henry Addis were [[quickly]] arrested and charged with publishing obscene information for the [[Whitman]] poem and a letter \""[[It]] Depends on the Women\"", signed by A.E.K. The A.E.K. letter [[presented]] [[various]] hypotheticals of women refusing or assenting to [[sex]] with their husbands or lovers, and argued that [[true]] liberation required education of both sexes and [[particularly]] women. [[After]] Isaak was released, the Isaak [[family]] moved the [[publication]] to San Francisco, California, and [[resumed]] publication under the name Free Society. [[However]], while [[Free]] Society [[continued]] to discuss free [[love]] and [[advocate]] for equality of the sexes, it did not [[openly]] defy the Comstock laws again.

"Presidential [[elections]] were held in France on 24 April and 8 [[May]] 1988. [[In]] 1981, the Socialist Party leader, [[François]] Mitterrand, was elected President of France and the [[Left]] won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the right regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac [[took]] responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \""reserved domain\"" – foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates [[opposed]] the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet [[advocated]] liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on [[wealth]] and selling some public companies. It was [[faced]] with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by [[President]] Mitterrand. [[Meanwhile]], the leadership of Chirac over the right was [[challenged]] by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. [[Barre]] gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", [[claiming]] that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth [[Republic]]\"". He [[appeared]] as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he [[announced]] his [[candidacy]], Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by SOFRES polls institute, against 23% for [[Barre]]. But, from the [[start]] of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and [[took]] the lead [[among]] the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist [[candidate]] was [[uncertain]]. Mitterrand [[said]] he was not sure he [[would]] run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel [[Rocard]] campaigned for the [[nomination]]. The favourite to win the [[election]] [[according]] to the polls, the incumbent president announced his [[candidacy]] at the end of March. He wrote an open [[letter]] to the French, where he proposed a moderate programme (\""neither nationalisations, nor [[privatizations]]\"") and advocated a \""united France\"" against \""the [[appropriation]] of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the RPR. [[He]] benefited from the decline of the French [[Communist]] [[Party]], represented by André Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \""reforming Communist\"", Pierre [[Juquin]] and a Trotskyist, Arlette Laguiller. Meanwhile, the Ecologist Antoine [[Waechter]] refused to ally the Greens with either the [[left]] or the [[right]]. On the far-right, the National [[Front]] leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, tried to confirm the FN's good result in the previous legislative election. The French economy shrugging off the early 1980s recession with 4% growth that year put the economy off the mind's of voters as well as popular social programs being implemented, both of which gave Mitterrand the economic argument to achieve a second term despite the fallback in the last legislative election that caused cohabitation.","Presidential [[recounts]] were held in France on 24 April and 8 [[took]] 1988. [[by]] 1981, the Socialist Party leader, [[francis]] Mitterrand, was elected President of France and the [[country]] won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the right regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac [[held]] responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \""reserved domain\"" – foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates [[constituted]] the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet [[contained]] liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on [[businesses]] and selling some public companies. It was [[staffed]] with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by [[president]] Mitterrand. [[previously]], the leadership of Chirac over the right was [[presided]] by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. [[has]] gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", [[denying]] that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth [[republic]]\"". He [[started]] as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he [[presented]] his [[candidates]], Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by SOFRES polls institute, against 23% for [[barre]]. But, from the [[month]] of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and [[sought]] the lead [[like]] the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist [[candidates]] was [[unsure]]. Mitterrand [[saying]] he was not sure he [[were]] run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel [[ot]] campaigned for the [[candidacy]]. The favourite to win the [[elections]] [[leading]] to the polls, the incumbent president announced his [[term]] at the end of March. He wrote an open [[letters]] to the French, where he proposed a moderate programme (\""neither nationalisations, nor [[politics]]\"") and advocated a \""united France\"" against \""the [[takeover]] of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the RPR. [[itself]] benefited from the decline of the French [[communist]] [[left]], represented by André Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \""reforming Communist\"", Pierre [[uet]] and a Trotskyist, Arlette Laguiller. Meanwhile, the Ecologist Antoine [[bourgeois]] refused to ally the Greens with either the [[right]] or the [[front]].

"Mohamed Alí Seineldín (Arabic: محمد علي زين الدين ) (November 12, 1933 in Concepción del Uruguay – September 2, 2009) was an Argentine army colonel who participated in two failed uprisings against the democratically elected governments of both President Raúl Alfonsín and President Carlos Menem in 1988 and 1990. Seineldín was born in Concepción del Uruguay into a Lebanese Argentine family. He converted from Druzism to Roman Catholicism during his youth, and was consecrated to the Virgin of Rosario (Virgen del Rosario). He remained a devout Roman [[Catholic]] [[throughout]] his life, even devoting his men in the [[army]] to the [[Virgin]] of the Holy Rosary as well.

An ardent Christian Argentine nationalist, [[Seineldín]] became a member of the Carapintadas, or \""painted [[faces]],\"" group within the Argentine Army. The Carapintadas demanded that the Argentine government halt legal proceedings against army [[officers]] accused of human rights abuses during the Dirty War, which occurred during Argentina's military [[dictatorship]] from 1976 to 1983. The low-ranking officers were charged with a wide range of crimes, including the execution of guerrilla dissidents, torture and kidnapping of guerrilla fighters and their supporters.

In December 1988, members of the Grupo Albatros, led by Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín rebelled once again against the Alfonsín [[government]] and seized the military barracks at [[Villa]] [[Martelli]].

"The Vancouver [[Dragons]] were a professional basketball [[team]] in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams.

"Nagana szlachectwa (Latin: [[Vituperatio]] nobilitatis), literally reprobation/reprimand/censure of nobility, also translated by Norman Davies as Test of [[Nobility]] was a legal procedure of the revocation of nobility in the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to the absence of formalized heraldry laws and lineage in early Poland, nobility of a person was tested in a regular court. The confirmation of nobility was based on calling for a certain number of witnesses. In Poland this was in accordance with a 1633 statute, in Lithuania by Chapter 3, Article 22 of a 1588 Statute. The latter demanded two witnesses each from the maternal and paternal side. The penalty for perjury was being stripped of own szlachta status by 1601. In case of the successful nagana, the accuser earned up to half of the property of the accused, the other half going to the state. The justice was highly prone to miscarriage, in particular, to abusive ennoblement Therefore, this procedure was gradually restricted in various ways. After 1581, the procedures took place before either the Crown Tribunal or the Lithuanian Tribunal. Norman Davies conjectures that this practice was among the factors leading to the establishment of a unique Polish practice of heraldic families (Polish: ród heraldyczny, \""heraldic clans\"", by Davies).

The league was successful enough for a major expansion in 2000. Expansion was done regionally to cut down on travel [[expense]]. [[hence]], the majority of the teams were in the Midwest. Midway through the 2000 season, the Topeka Knights changed [[seasons]] and nicknames and became the Kings. After the season, the entire league was [[consumed]] by the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators.

"Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[center]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered. Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, founder of Still Mind Zendo, has been a Zen teacher since 2000 prior to which she was in private practice as a spiritual director for 15 years, also working as a community organizer and peace activist. She is married to Sensei Gregory Abels and they are the parents of a grown daughter. Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels is co-resident teacher at Still Mind Zendo. As well as being a Zen teacher, he has enjoyed a 50 year career as an actor, theatre director and Master Teacher of Acting and is also a poet, his writing being informed by his Zen practice.

"40s Junction is a commercial-free music [[channel]] on the Sirius XM Radio platform, broadcasting on Sirius XM channel 73 as well as Dish Network channel 6073. (DirecTV formerly carried the channel as well, on channel 801, but as of February 9, 2010 had dropped Sirius XM programming in favor of SonicTap). The channel mostly plays big band, swing, and hit parade music from 1936 to 1949, with occasional songs from the early 1950s. Until May 7, 2015, the station was known as '40s on 4, and programming was broadcast on channel 4 as part of the Decades lineup of stations. It was moved to channel 73 to be nearer to stations featuring similar genres of music such as jazz and standards. For the first four months on channel 73, the station was known simply as '40s, before being rebranded as 40s Junction on August 13, 2015. Channel 4 is currently occupied by Pitbull's Globalization Radio. Both the 40s Junction name and the channel's longtime nickname, \""The Savoy Express\"", refer to the passenger train travel common in the 1940s. It also refers to the popular 1941 jazz song Chattanooga Choo Choo. The original \""Station Master\"" (Program Director) for the channel was Marlin Taylor, with Bob Moke as Music Director. Both have since departed, and the channel is currently programmed by Human Newman. The voice of the channel is Lou Brutus, who models his announcing style after that of Bing Crosby staff announcer Ken Carpenter. In keeping with the railroad theme, the channel's logo now features a train itself.","40s Junction is a commercial-free music [[facility]] on the Sirius XM Radio platform, broadcasting on Sirius XM channel 73 as well as Dish Network channel 6073.
