Its main platform includes a recognition of the two-state solution, the creation of a Palestinian state that would include an exchange of some largely Arab-inhabited parts of Israel for largely Jewish-inhabited parts of the West Bank. The party maintains an anti-clerical mantle and encourages socio-economic opportunities for new immigrants, in conjunction with efforts to increase Jewish immigration.

"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

The team improved the following season however, finishing 7th place at the 2010 European Curling Championships, qualifying them once again for the World Championships. At the 2011 Ford World Men's Curling Championship, the team earned their best finish at the worlds to date, placing in 8th. The next season, they had a great run at the 2011 European Curling Championships, making the playoffs for the first time. The team wound wind up placing fourth, after losing the bronze medal match to Denrmark's Rasmus Stjerne. They could not replicate their success however at the 2012 World Men's Curling Championship, where they once again finished last. 2012-13 would be the best season for the Czech team. The team would finish the round robin portion of the 2012 European Curling Championships in 2nd with a 7-2 record. However, the team lost to Norway's Thomas Ulsrud in the semi-final, before rebounding to beat the Danes in the bronze medal match. This would be a first for the country in curling, as it is the first time that the Czech Republic got a medal in international play.",0

"Russells Hall Hospital is an [[NHS]] general hospital [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, [[England]], run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the [[town]] centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first [[planned]] in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The [[first]] phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment [[meant]] that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells [[Hall]] to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital [[would]] close completely and Corbett and [[Dudley]] Guest [[would]] be downsized to out-patient [[services]] only, with Russells [[Hall]] being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first [[phases]] of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was [[completed]] during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in [[size]].

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"William Harold [[Lee]] (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles.

"George Elliott [[Hagan]] (May 24, 1916 – December 26, 1990) was an [[American]] politician, businessman and farmer and a Democrat. Hagan was [[born]] in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the [[University]] of Georgia in Athens. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1939 to 1944, resigned from office to join the United States Army as a member of the Signal Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. [[He]] served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to 33,629), but under Georgia's election laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a month after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. [[Hagan]] would serve six terms from the 87th United States Congress to the 92nd United States Congress. He ran unopposed in 1962, and faced minor Independent opposition in 1964, winning with 72%. In 1966, he was [[challenged]] in the Democratic primary by several opponents and was forced by Savannah State Sen. Frank [[Downing]] into a runoff. Hagan [[held]] off Downing by a margin of 53-47%. In the [[general]] election, he faced his first Republican opponent, [[Porter]] Carswell (1904-?) of Burke County, who held [[Hagan]] to a 58-42% margin. In 1968, he [[would]] face desultory opposition in the primary and [[defeated]] Savannah Republican State Senator and former Georgia Republican Party chairman Joe Tribble (1920–2003) by a 68-32% margin. He would dispatch another challenger in the 1970 Democratic primary by [[2-to-1]] and faced no Republican in the general [[election]]. In 1972, former Hagan staffer and assistant Ronald 'Bo' Ginn [[would]] aggressively challenge his former boss in a spirited [[three-man]] primary. Holding Hagan to a 43-39% margin in the first round, Ginn would defeat Hagan by a margin of 55-45% in the runoff. Ginn would go on to win the general unopposed.

"Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (Arabic: محمد أحمد ابن عبد الله; [[August]] 12, 1844 – June 22, 1885) was a religious [[leader]] of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who, on June 29, 1881, [[proclaimed]] himself the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith.

"Dark Discoveries is an internationally distributed, quarterly slick [[magazine]] formerly published by Dark Discoveries Publications, and now published by Journalstone, LLC. [[It]] focuses primarily on the horror fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction genres. The [[magazine's]] content includes short fiction, interviews, nonfiction articles, profiles of industry notables, and is fully illustrated. Dark Discoveries Publications was originally founded in January, 2004 by James R. Beach of Longview, WA. The magazine began as a black and white periodical with David Emrich, of David Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from 2004 to 2007. Together Editor-in-chief Beach and designer Emrich created the basic look and feel of the magazine that continued through the first ten issues. Designer Cesar Puch briefly took over the layout for two issues in 2008, but left for a job with Bad Moon Books after that. Dark Discoveries then became a color publication in 2009 after Jason V Brock became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni Productions, LLC, who also maintained the Dark Discoveries website) and Art Director in 2008, helping to salvage the magazine from being discontinued by publisher Beach. Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press. Dark Discoveries, both the magazine and name, were purchased by JournalStone, LLC. Owner/President Christopher C. Payne in August, 2012. The page count was expanded, the format changed to a perfect-bound magazine, and color was added to all of the pages, the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all concepts Brock had predicted would be needed to continue the magazine).

"The [[Nedbank]] [[Golf]] [[Challenge]], previously [[known]] as the Million [[Dollar]] Challenge, is an annual men's [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the Gary Player Country Club in [[Sun]] City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the major [[tours]], but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the [[world's]] highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field.

"Oleg [[Mikhailovich]] [[Romanishin]] (born 10 January 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] chess grandmaster and former European junior [[champion]]. Many [[honours]] and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. [[After]] winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same [[year]]. [[In]] 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in Teesside, England, where he [[scored]] the best result for board 4 (8/9). The [[following]] year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail [[Tal]] and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran [[Petrosian]]. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad [[1975]], Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 ([[shared]] with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 ([[shared]] with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen [[1990]]. [[Playing]] the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most [[impressive]] victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less [[active]] as a tournament player, he has nevertheless [[maintained]] a highly competitive rating and is able to [[win]] smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. [[At]] the [[Olympiads]] he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the [[1990s]], winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team [[Chess]] Championships his medal haul has amounted to an [[incredible]] 6 gold and 1 silver. [[His]] chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this [[may]] be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor [[Kart]] (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an [[improver]], was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an [[ex-world]] champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess [[opening]] theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, [[offbeat]] and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by [[means]] of [[deep]] research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg [[chuk]] [[ov]] (born 10 January 1952 in Lviv) is a [[prominent]] chess grandmaster and former European junior [[champions]].

"Perfect [[Records]] was a United States-based [[record]] [[label]] founded in 1922 by Pathé [[Records]] to [[produce]] cheap 78 rpm [[discs]]. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as [[opposed]] to the more common black shellac of the era.

This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way [[tended]] to have a lot of rumble that was not [[detected]] by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"".

Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school. Contributors to Girl Germs included Kathleen Hanna; Jean Smith of Mecca Normal; Sue P. Fox; Kaia Wilson; the editors of Double Bill, G.B. Jones, Jena von Brücker, Caroline Azar, Johnny Noxzema and Rex; Jen Smith; and Erin Smith of Bratmobile. Groups interviewed by Girl Germs editors include Calamity Jane, Unrest, 7 Year Bitch, Jawbox and Fastbacks. Girl Germs also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time.

"Ricky S. Moore (born April 10, 1976) is a [[retired]] American basketball player and current coach. He is currently an assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He played professionally for eleven years. Moore came to UConn after an All-American high school career at Westside High School in Augusta, Georgia. He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998–99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard [[Trajan]] Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily-favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team. After graduation, Moore played professionally in the United States, Austria, Ukraine, Sweden, Turkey, and Germany over eleven seasons.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the [[Hungaria]] family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an [[eccentricity]] of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroids]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belts]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronicus]] II Palaeologus [[hired]] 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

It is a biographical museum that offers an insight into the life and therefore the teachings of Sadhu Vaswani. The museum is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the Sadhu Vaswani Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings – in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, holographic screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011.

"Weyerbacher Brewing [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States, founded in 1995 by [[Dan]] and Sue Weirback. The brewery is [[well]] [[known]] for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

Hops Infusion is [[one]] of the bitterest examples of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in [[wooden]] [[barrels]] previously used for aging bourbon. This [[process]] was [[used]] to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering [[Idiot]] into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and [[QUAD]] into Blasphemy. [[These]] four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends [[additional]] oak and whiskey flavors. [[The]] results have been widely [[praised]] by fans of huge beers, [[though]] persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may [[find]] them an acquired taste. [[In]] September 2008, Weyerbacher [[released]] a limited run of a seasonal India pale [[ale]], marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that [[featured]] a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the [[Weirbacks]] on their farm.

"Canaiolo (also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine [[grape]] grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany.

In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares). Today there are renewed efforts by Tuscan winemakers to find better clonal selections and re-introduce the variety into popular usage.

"Martin Bruce Cameron ([[born]] 24 August 1936), Australian politician, was a [[member]] of the Australian Senate and the South Australian Legislative [[Council]]. [[In]] 1968 Cameron contested the safe Labor House of Assembly [[seat]] of Millicent for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent [[Des]] Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but [[lost]] by one vote. Cameron [[challenged]] the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which [[ordered]] a by-election. Corcoran [[comfortably]] won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught [[died]] suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. [[However]], Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative [[Council]] in 1971 [[following]] the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He [[became]] an important ally of Steele Hall (now [[Leader]] of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible [[moderate]] forces [[within]] the party. Cameron often opposed his [[fellow]] LCL Legislative Councillors, [[due]] to his support for Universal [[Suffrage]] for that chamber. This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally functioned as a faction within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the LCL (led at this stage by Bruce Eastick) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement members, such as future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown, decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron left with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 Election when he was joined by John Carnie. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the LCL (renamed the Liberal Party of Australia in 1974), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification. In 1976 Cameron and Hall rejoined the Liberal Party, while Millhouse initially formed the New LM before helping found the Australian Democrats. Despite not serving in the Tonkin ministry, Cameron assumed the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council after the election of the John Bannon Labor government at the 1982 Elections. He held this position until his retirement from politics in 1990. Following his retirement from the Council, Cameron served a term as president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party. Later, he became a vocal supporter of the 'yes' case in the 1999 republic referendum.","Martin Bruce Cameron ([[reigned]] 24 August 1936), Australian politician, was a [[membership]] of the Australian Senate and the South Australian Legislative [[councils]].

"The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[band]] [[formed]] in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"". The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have [[sold]] more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks.

"George Washington Murray (September 22, 1853 – April 21, 1926), born into slavery in South Carolina, became educated and worked as a teacher, farmer and politician. After serving as chairman of the Sumter County Republican Party, he was elected in the 1890s as a United States congressman from South Carolina. He was the only black member in the 53rd and [[54th]] Congresses. Because South Carolina passed a constitution in 1895 that effectively [[disenfranchised]] blacks and crippled the Republican Party, Murray was the last Republican [[elected]] in the state for nearly 100 years.

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, [[form]] the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly [[known]] as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""[[ascus]]\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the [[Ascomycota]] are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the [[Ascomycota]].

This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

In the year of 2006, it was considered the biggest pride parade of the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$ 1 million reais in the parade. The event is the second largest of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best of the world. The Pride and its associated events are organized by the APOGLBT, Associação da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais, since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities as well as to the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade.

Even though the meeting time is at 12 noon, the parade doesn't start to move before 2 or 3 PM. The parade is 2.6 miles long (4.2 km) and starts at Avenida Paulista (MASP), at around noon. It follows Rua da Consolação to the end at Praça Roosevelt, in Downtown São Paulo, at around 10 PM. Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan.

In the year of 2006, it was considered the biggest pride parade of the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$ 1 million reais in the parade. The event is the second largest of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best of the world. The Pride and its associated events are organized by the APOGLBT, Associação da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais, since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities as well as to the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route.

"The [[slaty-backed]] gull (Larus [[schistisagus]]) is a large white-headed gull that breeds on the western coast of Alaska but travels widely during nonbreeding seasons. It is similar in appearance to the western gull and the glaucous-winged gull. Another alternate name is Pacific gull, though this also applies to a southern hemisphere species, Larus [[pacificus]]. Claims have been made as to its (sometimes occasional) presence throughout North America as well as the eastern coast of Asia. On November 3, 2012, an individual was spotted in Finland. The species has only been spotted three times before in Europe. It measures 55–68.5 cm (21.7–27.0 in) in length, 132–160 cm (52–63 in) in wingspan and weighs 1.05–1.7 kg (2.3–3.7 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 40.6 to 48 cm (16.0 to 18.9 in), the bill is 4.8 to 6.5 cm (1.9 to 2.6 in) and the tarsus is 6 to 7.6 cm (2.4 to 3.0 in). It has a white head, belly, and tail with a dark slaty-gray back and wings with a broad white trailing edge. The wings and back are slightly darker than those of the Western Gull. The underside of the wings features a \""string of pearls\"" pattern along their edges; these can be seen from below when the bird is in flight. Its eyes are yellow. The legs are pink and short when compared with those of similar-looking gulls, and the body appears more stout. The bill is yellow with orange-red subterminal spot.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the [[culminating]] point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the [[Assyrians]] for control over the remnants of the [[former]] empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) [[conquered]] Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the [[large]] part of [[territories]] of this kingdom between his allies. [[The]] rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a [[Hittite]] vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with [[Ḫatti]]. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also [[known]] as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a [[railroad]] [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. [[The]] Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 [[miles]] (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna [[Old]] Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 [[fewer]] curves, with all but one permitting passenger [[train]] [[speeds]] of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its [[construction]]. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. The bridge is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.","The [[sandstone]] Viaduct is a large wrought iron box [[truss]] bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia.

"Herbert Alexander Bruce [[FRCS]] (September 28, 1868 – [[June]] 23, 1963), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, [[Bruce]] was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of Toronto and in [[Paris]] and Vienna. [[He]] was a [[member]] of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. He owned [[Wellesley]] [[Hospital]] in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the [[University]] of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]] by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the [[rank]] of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce [[investigated]] medical practices in the army and [[issued]] a [[Report]] on the Canadian Army Medical Service which [[urged]] a complete reorganization of the medical corps. [[Few]] of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. [[Bruce's]] report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he [[named]] Annandale. [[In]] 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a [[term]] that lasted until 1937.

He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"Sir Matthew [[Hale]] [[SL]] (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, [[judge]] and lawyer most [[noted]] for his treatise Historia [[Placitorum]] Coronæ, or [[The]] [[History]] of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his [[wife]], who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was [[raised]] by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and [[inherited]] his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), [[intending]] to [[become]] a priest, but after a series of distractions was [[persuaded]] to [[become]] a barrister [[like]] his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a [[dispute]] over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 [[May]] 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist [[figures]] during the prelude and duration of the English Civil [[War]], including Thomas Wentworth and [[William]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that [[Hale]] was to represent Charles I at his state [[trial]], and conceived the defence Charles [[used]]. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for [[integrity]] and his political neutrality saved him from any [[repercussions]], and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the [[Commission's]] dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common [[Pleas]]. [[As]] a judge, [[Hale]] was noted for his [[resistance]] to bribery and his [[willingness]] to make politically unpopular decisions which [[upheld]] the [[law]]. He sat in Parliament, either in the [[Commons]] or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of [[Parliament]] who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as [[monarch]], sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then [[Chief]] Justice of the King's Bench. [[In]] both positions, he was again [[noted]] for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative [[judge]].

Born to a barrister and his [[wives]], who had both died by the time he was [[five]], Hale was [[brought]] by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and [[learned]] his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[university]]), [[studied]] to [[becoming]] a priest, but after a series of distractions was [[convinced]] to [[turn]] a barrister [[of]] his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a [[disputes]] over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[entering]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 [[might]] 1636. [[since]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist [[people]] during the prelude and duration of the English Civil [[wars]], including Thomas Wentworth and [[william]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that [[hale]] was to represent Charles I at his state [[trials]], and conceived the defence Charles [[had]]. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for [[gallantry]] and his political neutrality saved him from any [[loss]], and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[given]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the [[estates]] dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common [[court]]. [[though]] a judge, [[hale]] was noted for his [[resistant]] to bribery and his [[will]] to make politically unpopular decisions which [[challenged]] the [[laws]]. He sat in Parliament, either in the [[estates]] or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of [[parliament]] who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as [[executed]], sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then [[was]] Justice of the King's Bench. [[by]] both positions, he was again [[awarded]] for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative [[jurist]]. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 [[jul]] 1676, dying ten months later on 25 [[december]] 1676.

"The men's single sculls competition at the 2000 [[Summer]] Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[took]] place at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. [[This]] rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held.

"The SM [[Kirov]] Stadium was a [[multi-purpose]] stadium in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The stadium was named after Sergey Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium.

"The Belmond Copacabana Palace is a [[luxury]] hotel located on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The hotel is widely considered as South America's premier hotel, and has received the rich and famous for over 90 years. It faces the coast, and consists of an 8-story main building and a 14-story annex. The Art Deco hotel was designed by French architect Joseph Gire. It has 216 rooms (148 in the main building and 78 in the annex), a semi-olympic swimming pool, an exclusive swimming pool for VIP guests located at the penthouse, a tennis court, fitness center, a 3-story spa, three bars all of them inside the respective restaurants, one with Italian food, one with pan-Asiatic and other with international food. It was inaugurated on August 13, 1923. It was featured in the 1933 film Flying Down to Rio. After [[Brasília]] became the Brazilian capital in 1960, the hotel underwent a period of slow decline and was surpassed by the more modern hotels which were built in the 1970s. There were plans to demolish the hotel in 1985, but they were scrapped afterwards. The hotel was refurbished sometime after 1989 when the [[Orient-Express]] Hotels bought it. Since being refurbished, the hotel once again rose to the top of Rio de Janeiro's (and South America's) luxury 5-star hotel market. (In March 2014 Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. renamed itself Belmond Hotels, and the hotel was renamed Belmond Copacabana Palace.) Many famous people have been guests at the Copacabana Palace, including Madonna, Michael Jackson, Robbie Williams, Walt Disney, Rolling Stones, Elizabeth Taylor, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe, Rita [[Hayworth]], Gina Lollobrigida, Brigitte [[Bardot]], Diana, Princess of Wales, Harald V of Norway, Queen [[Sonja]] of Norway, Luciano Pavarotti among others. In 1998, Alexander Frey conducted the Rio de Janeiro Philharmonic Orchestra in a sold-out gala concert in the hotel's Golden Room featuring the music of James [[Helme]] Sutcliffe, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johannes Brahms. In 2008, the Copacabana Palace was confirmed as a cultural patrimony of the city of Rio de Janeiro. [[It]] had already previously been appointed as such by the federal government (8/14/86), by the municipal government (4/7/2003) and in 10/30/2008 was confirmed as such by all three spheres of government.","The Belmond Copacabana Palace is a [[hotel]] hotel located on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

"Athanasios John Traicos (born 17 [[May]] 1947) is a [[former]] cricketer who represented South Africa and Zimbabwe at [[international]] [[level]]. [[He]] was [[primarily]] an off spin bowler, and is one of a [[small]] number of [[cricketers]] to have played at the highest [[level]] for more than one country. Traicos was [[born]] in Zagazig, Egypt in 1947 where his father [[Tryphon]] [[worked]] in the family business. He is of Greek [[descent]], his [[father]] having been born in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal [[grandmother]] in Kalymnos, [[also]] in Greece. In September 1948 the family [[moved]] to what was then Fort [[Victoria]] in Southern Rhodesia. [[As]] a child he was known as \""[[Naso]]\"", a contraction of his name \""Athanasios\"", but when he started [[university]] he adopted the name \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and [[played]] for that [[country]], which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" [[within]] the South African domestic cricket setup. While a [[student]] at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard [[making]] his first-class [[debut]] on 24 [[June]] 1967 when he represented South African [[Universities]] against Cambridge [[University]], taking 5–54 in the first innings.

"The 2015 Catalan parliamentary [[election]] was held on [[Sunday]], 27 September 2015, electing the 11th Parliament of Catalonia, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Catalonia. All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election. This was the third regional Catalan election in only five years, after the 2010 and 2012 elections and the first one in over 37 years in which Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) ran separately, after the dissolution of Convergence and Union (CiU) in June 2015 over disgreements on the coalition's separatist turn. The plan to hold a snap election in 2015 was announced on 14 January by President Artur Mas. After the non-binding 2014 independence referendum, Mas declared that the election was to be turned into an alternative vote on independence, with pro-independence parties including the independence goal in their election manifestos. As part of the process, CDC, along with Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Democrats of Catalonia (DC) and Left Movement (MES) would run together under the Together for Yes (JxSí) platform, with support from members of the pro-independence Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Òmnium and the Municipalities' Association for Independence (AMI). The alliance, however, failed to achieve its self-stated goal to attain an absolute majority on its own.

"[[Rhithropanopeus]] [[harrisii]] ([[common]] names include the Zuiderzee crab, dwarf crab, estuarine mud crab, Harris mud crab, and white-tipped mud crab), is a small omnivorous crab native to Atlantic coasts of the Americas, from New Brunswick to Veracruz. R. harrisii is [[usually]] [[found]] in brackish water, but can also be [[found]] in freshwater. It likes to live on [[stones]] and in oyster beds. The crab can reach a maximum [[size]] of 20 millimetres (0.8 in). It has an olive-green-brownish color, sometimes with dark spots on its carapace. It is a common inhabitant of Texas and Florida estuaries, but was later introduced all over the world. In 1937, it was discovered to be invading the San Francisco Bay's brackish waters and adjacent fresh waters of the California Central Valley. It was also recently discovered in the Third Lock Lake in Panama, a man-made lake intended to be a part of the Panama Canal. R. harrisii was first discovered in Europe in the Zuider Zee, the Netherlands, and is now also found in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, Poland, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria, from the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. In the British Isles, R. harrisii has only been observed in Roath Docks, Cardiff, which have lower salinity (12‰) than the surrounding waters.

R. harrisii is [[normally]] [[lives]] in brackish water, but can also be [[introduced]] in freshwater. It likes to live on [[pebbles]] and in oyster beds. The crab can reach a maximum [[depths]] of 20 millimetres (0.8 in). It has an olive-green-brownish color, sometimes with dark spots on its carapace. It is a common inhabitant of Texas and Florida estuaries, but was later introduced all over the world. In 1937, it was discovered to be invading the San Francisco Bay's brackish waters and adjacent fresh waters of the California Central Valley. It was also recently discovered in the Third Lock Lake in Panama, a man-made lake intended to be a part of the Panama Canal. R. harrisii was first discovered in Europe in the Zuider Zee, the Netherlands, and is now also found in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, Poland, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Romania and Bulgaria, from the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. In the British Isles, R. harrisii has only been observed in Roath Docks, Cardiff, which have lower salinity (12‰) than the surrounding waters.

"The Ohrid–Debar [[uprising]] (Macedonian: Охридско-Дебaрско вoстание, Ohridsko-Debarsko vostanie; Albanian: Kryengritja e Dibër-Ohrit; Serbian: Охридско-дебарски устанак, Ohridsko-Debarski ustanak; Bulgarian: Охридско-Дебърско въстание, Ohridsko-Debarsko vǎstanie) was an uprising in Western Macedonia, then Kingdom of Serbia, in September 1913. It was organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and by local Albanian leaders against the Serbian capture of the regions of Ohrid, Debar and Struga after the Balkan Wars. The rebellion started only two months after the end of the Second Balkan War. The Albanian government organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days. After a fortnight of fierce fighting, a Serbian army of 100,000 regulars suppressed the uprising.

"The 2010 United States Senate [[election]] in [[Florida]] took place on November 2, 2010 concurrently with other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Republican Senator Mel [[Martínez]], who was elected in a very close race against Democrat Betty Castor with 49% of the vote in 2004, announced on December 2, 2008, that he would not run for re-election to a second term, then announcing on August 7, 2009, that he would resign prior to the end of his term. The Governor of Florida, Republican Charlie Crist, was required to appoint a successor and he chose his former Chief of Staff, George LeMieux. LeMieux, a placeholder who did not run in the election, replaced Martínez in the Senate on September 10, 2009. Crist publicly announced he was running for the seat in mid-2009. When he declared his candidacy, he received many Republican endorsements, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Martínez, and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. However, his support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives, and Tea Party candidate Marco Rubio, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, surged in the polls. In April 2010, Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. The National Republican Senatorial Committee withdrew its endorsement of Crist and demanded a refund of its campaign funds that it provided for the Crist campaign. Rubio went on to win the Republican primary against only token opposition. U.S. Representative Kendrick Meek was the first Democrat to declare his intention to run and he defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene in his [[party's]] primary.

He was supported by Republican and some Independent voters whereas Democratic and other Independents were split between Crist and Meek.

"[[Elisaeus]] Adougan was a late 14th century and early 15th century Scottish cleric. His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390, but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of [[Lincluden]] providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine [[nunnery]], was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ...

The race is currently open to horses age three and older and offers a purse of $300,000. The Pimlico Special was first run in 1937 and was won by that year's U.S. Triple Crown winner War Admiral who went on to be voted the American Horse of the Year. In 1938, the Pimlico Special was host to one of American racing's historic moments when Seabiscuit defeated War Admiral in a much anticipated match race.

"The Oregon [[Trunk]] Rail Bridge or [[Celilo]] Bridge is a single-track railroad bridge opened in 1912 over the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It consists of eight steel truss spans and several deck girder spans, and since 1957 it has included a vertical-lift section. The bridge was designed by engineer Ralph Modjeski and erected by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co., of [[Leavenworth]], Kansas. It is part of the Wishram, Washington to Bend, Oregon line of the BNSF Railway (formerly the Oregon Trunk line of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway). The bridge is downstream of the site of Celilo Falls, now submerged by water impounded by The Dalles Dam. The Celilo Canal passed beneath the southernmost span, which was a swing span. Completion of The Dalles Dam in 1957 inundated the canal. Over a period of several months starting in October 1956, the bridge was raised by up to [[5]] feet (1.5 m) over its entire length, and the truss span to the north of the swing span was modified to a [[vertical-lift-type]] span for river navigation. The new lift span's first complete raising and lowering took place on June 21, 1957, and the bridge reopened to rail traffic the following day. The swing span, to the south of the lift span, remains in place, but it ceased to be used after the lift span was installed. It was \""permanently locked in place\"" in October 1956, for the start of work to modify the bridge. All of the bridge's piers rest on rocks that were normally exposed during low water periods.

"Laurie [[Fowler]] (born 29 December 1951) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Richmond and Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL). After finishing runner-up in the senior best and fairest count as a 16-year-old at Oakleigh Districts, Fowler was zoned to Richmond. Working his way up from the thirds side, Fowler made his senior VFL debut in 1971 and soon became recognised as a tough and courageous defender. He will be best remembered as the player who crashed into Carlton captain-coach John Nicholls at the start of the 1973 VFL Grand Final. The collision severely impacted Nicholls and helped Richmond avenge their loss to Carlton in the previous year's Grand Final. Richmond won the premiership again in 1974, but Fowler quit after he was omitted from the team. The Tigers considered Fowler's senior options to be limited and sold him to Melbourne, the club Fowler had supported as a child, for $15,000 (equivalent to over $100,000 in 2009). Fowler made an instant impact with the struggling Demons, winning the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Medal for the best and fairest player at the club in his first season. Although primarily a back-pocket player, Melbourne coach Bob Skilton also used Fowler as a ruck-rover to help cover for Greg Wells' lack of defensive skills in the midfield. In 1976, Melbourne narrowly missed out on the finals after Carlton drew with Footscray in the final round of the home-and-away season. Fowler was again among Melbourne's best players, finishing [[runner-up]] to Wells in the Keith Truscott Medal count. Skilton was replaced as coach by former premiership player Dennis Jones at the end of the 1977 VFL season, but Melbourne's fortunes did not improve and they finished last in 1978. During that season, Fowler had to be talked out of retirement after being relegated to the Reserves, and then quit for a brief time in May after being substituted against North Melbourne. Despite receiving offers from a number of top clubs at the time, Fowler returned to Melbourne just days later and reconciled. Jones was sacked at the end of the season and Carl Ditterich returned as captain-coach. Although Melbourne did not fare much better under Ditterich, Fowler continued to stand out, winning successive Keith Truscott Medals in 1979 and 1980 and representing Victoria at interstate level in 1980 and 1981. Fowler walked out on Melbourne after contract negotiations failed before the start of the 1982 VFL season. Instead, he [[spent]] the season in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) with Waverley.

"Fred Warren [[Waters]] (February 2, 1927 – August 28, 1989) was an [[American]] professional baseball player, manager, scout and coach. The left-handed [[pitcher]] appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955–1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the [[University]] of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949–58; 1960–62) pitching career in minor league baseball. He was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one trade in Major League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. [[In]] [[three]] seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.","Fred Warren [[donald]] (February 2, 1927 – August 28, 1989) was an [[outstanding]] professional baseball player, manager, scout and coach.

"The Iraqi Accord Front or Iraqi Accordance Front (Arabic: جبهة التوافق العراقية Jabhet Al-Tawafuq Al-'Iraqiyah) also known as Tawafuq is an Iraqi Sunni political coalition created on October 26, 2005 by the Iraqi Islamic Party to contest the December 2005 general election.

"The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Region of Sudan (Arabic: [[حزب]] البعث العربي الاشتراكي - وطن [[في]] السودان Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-Arabi Al-Ishtiraki - Watan fi Al-Sudan), previously known as the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Country of Sudan, is a political [[party]] in Sudan. The party is the Sudanese regional branch of the [[Iraqi-led]] Ba'ath Party in Sudan. While the branch has always been small, accounting for an estimated 1,000 members in 2003, it has been able to have a bigger impact than what its meager membership numbers would suggest, mostly due to Iraqi financing of the branch. After collaborating with the Arab nationalist Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990; this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the 1991 Gulf crisis. In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in Ba'athist Iraq. The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, and was opposed to the National Islamic Front and was staunchly secularist. Members have historically been torn between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the Sudanese Communist Party. Because of Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, the body ruling Sudan, the Ba'ath branch was oppressed by the authorities. Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in Khartoum after a failed military coup. In 2002, a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein broke away from the branch and established the independent Sudanese Ba'ath Party, which has no affiliation with either the Iraqi or the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party.

"[[DJ]] Boy, also [[known]] as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up [[game]] partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities.

"Jerry Allen [[Walker]] ([[born]] February 12, 1939 in Ada, Oklahoma) is a former right-handed [[pitcher]] in American Major League Baseball who [[performed]] for the Baltimore [[Orioles]], Kansas City Athletics and Cleveland Indians between 1957 and 1964. [[During]] his career, he [[stood]] 6 [[feet]] 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and [[weighed]] 195 pounds (88 kg). [[He]] signed with [[Baltimore]] as a \""bonus [[baby]]\"" out of Ada's Byng High School on June 28, 1957. A [[member]] of the Orioles' fabled \""Kiddie Corps\"" of young [[pitchers]] signed in the late 1950s (others included Milt Pappas, Steve Barber and Chuck [[Estrada]]), Walker is one of a very few players to have [[gone]] straight to the Major Leagues without ever playing a game in the minor leagues. In his debut, on July 6, 1957, against the Boston Red Sox, he failed to retire a batter, issuing bases on balls to Mickey Vernon and Jackie Jensen, then uncorking a wild pitch. Walker then was lifted from the game, but both runners [[scored]], giving Walker an earned run average of infinity coming out of his first MLB game. However, he was consistently more effective as the season progressed, and threw a four-hit, complete game shutout against the Washington Senators on September 4, beating Camilo Pascual 1–0 for his first big-league victory. He also became the youngest pitcher ever to start a Major League [[Baseball]] All-Star game when, at age 20, he went to mound for the American League in the second All-Star contest of 1959. Walker went three innings and allowed one run on two hits and one base on balls, and was credited with the win in a 5–3 AL victory at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Later that season, on September 11, 1959, he hurled a 16-inning, complete game shutout against the eventual league champion Chicago White Sox, winning 1–0. It was his 11th and final win of the 1959 season, his most successful campaign in the big leagues. By age 26, however, Walker was out of the Majors. In 190 games pitched, 90 as a starter, he allowed 734 hits and 341 bases on balls over 747 innings. He had 326 strikeouts, 16 complete games, four shutouts and 13 saves. Walker's active career [[ended]] in 1967 in the Double-A Eastern League. He has maintained his involvement in organized [[baseball]] as a minor league manager, big-league pitching coach, scout and front-office executive. He served one season (1993) as the general manager of the Detroit Tigers. From 1995 through 2007, he was the vice president and director of player personnel in the front office of the St. Louis Cardinals, working as a key assistant to then-GM Walt Jocketty.

"Age of Electric is a Canadian hard rock [[band]] founded in 1989 with members from Lanigan and Regina, Saskatchewan. The members are singer/guitarist Todd Kerns, guitarist Ryan Dahle, bassist John Kerns and drummer Kurt Dahle. Ryan and Kurt also provide backing vocals. AOE were a commercially successful Canadian rock band of the mid-90s. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995. In 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with their side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \""Remote Control\"", which peaked at No. 9 on Canada's Singles Chart and was later featured on MuchMusic's diamond certified compilation album, Big Shiny Tunes 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace. Upon the break-up of Age of Electric, the brothers Kerns would go on to form Static in Stereo with other members including their brother Ryan. Kurt Dahle went on to work with The New Pornographers. Todd Kerns is now the bass player and backup vocalist with Slash's band The Conspirators. In July 2015, Age of Electric performed a reunion show scheduled in Calgary on August 29, 2015 ( with opening act, Zuckerbaby), marking their first public performance together in over 17 years.","Age of Electric is a Canadian hard rock [[bands]] founded in 1989 with members from Lanigan and Regina, Saskatchewan.

"The [[2012]] Wisconsin gubernatorial election were recall elections to [[elect]] the governor and lieutenant governor of [[Wisconsin]].

"William [[Froude]] (/ˈfruːd/; 28 November 1810 in Devon – 4 May 1879 in Simonstown, South Africa) was an English engineer, [[hydrodynamicist]] and naval architect. He was the first to formulate reliable laws for the resistance that water offers to ships (such as the hull speed equation) and for predicting their stability. Froude was born at Dartington, Devon, England, the son of Robert [[Froude]], Archdeacon of Totnes and was educated at Westminster School and Oriel College, [[Oxford]], [[graduating]] with a first in mathematics in 1832. His first [[employment]] was as a surveyor on the South [[Eastern]] Railway which, in 1837, [[led]] to Brunel [[giving]] him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced analternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction, near Exeter. [[At]] Brunel's invitation Froude [[turned]] his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of Naval Architects became influential in ship design. This [[led]] to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape, which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models: he established a formula (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the picture) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws; Raven's sharp prow [[followed]] the \""waveline\"" theory of John Scott Russell, but Swan's [[blunter]] profile [[proved]] to offer lower resistance. His experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was [[built]], at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to [[combine]] mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still [[followed]] today. In 1877, he was commissioned by the [[Admiralty]] to [[produce]] a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the [[power]] of large naval engines. He invented and [[built]] the world's first water brake dynamometer, sometimes [[known]] as the hydraulic dynamometer, which led to the formation of Heenan & [[Froude]] Ltd in Birmingham. He died while on [[holiday]] (as an official guest of the [[Royal]] Navy) in [[Simonstown]], South Africa, and was buried there with [[full]] naval honours.

"[[Rough]] Trade Records is an independent record label based in London, England. It was formed in 1978 by Geoff Travis who had opened a record store off Ladbroke Grove.

"666 Desdemona, provisional designation 1908 DM, is a stony [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], approximately 27 kilometers in diameter. It was [[discovered]] on 23 July [[1908]], by German astronomer August Kopff at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The stony S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a [[distance]] of 2.0–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,525 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery in 1908. In 2013, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by astronomer Anna Marciniak at Poznań Observatory, Poland. It gave a rotation period of 14.607±0.004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 in magnitude (U=2+), superseding a period from in 2000, obtained at the Californian Santana Observatory (646), which gave a slightly longer period of 15.45±0.01 hours and an amplitude of 0.11 (U=2). Between 2004 and 2006, three more light-curves were constructed from photometric observations, but they were all fragmentary and based on results with less than full coverage (U=2-/1+/2-). According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid's surface has an albedo between 0.095 and 0.106. While the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the space-based IRAS and Akari surveys on a diameter of approximately 27 kilometers, the results from WISE and NEOWISE found a larger diameter of 31.5 to 32.7 kilometers, respectively. The minor planet was named after the wife of Othello in the play The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice written in 1604 by William Shakespeare, after whom the minor planet 2985 Shakespeare is named. It is presumed that the naming of \""Desdemona\"" could have been inspired by the two letters of its provisional designation (1908 DM). One of the [[satellites]] of Uranus (Uranus X), discovered by the Voyager 2 in 1986, is also named Desdemona (H 68).","666 Desdemona, provisional designation 1908 DM, is a stony [[asteroids]] from the inner regions of the asteroid [[ring]], approximately 27 kilometers in diameter.

"McKeon [[Pavilion]] is a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena at Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga, California. Home men's and women's basketball and volleyball games are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project. With gym renovations years away, the college has made several upgrades to the facility. Prior to the 2005-2006 season new floors were installed. Before the 2006-2007 season, the lower level reserved seating (directly behind the benches) was changed from bleachers to stadium-style seats with backs. The bleachers in the student section (also known as Gaelforce) - opposite the benches - were painted dark blue. Large banners were hung from the railings separating the upper and lower seating sections, reading \""Saint Mary's College\"" behind the reserved seating and \""Gaelforce\"" behind the student section. More recently, the student section has been filled with Australian flags, reflecting the prevalence of Australians on the Gaels squad, including former star Patty Mills. In recent memory, the gym has seen the 2001 women's basketball team and the 2005 men's basketball team reach the NCAA Tournament. The women's volleyball team has also achieved much success, reaching the post-season in 2004-2006. During the 2004-2005 season the men's basketball team posted a 15-1 record in their home gym en route to a bubble NCAA tournament berth.

"The Whitlam Government [[refers]] to the federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. It was made up of members of the Australian Labor Party. The government commenced when it defeated the McMahon Government in the 1972 federal election after a record 23 years of Coalition government. It concluded in historic circumstances, when it was dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr as a result of the 1975 constitutional crisis and was succeeded by the Fraser Government. The Whitlam Government remains the only federal government in Australian history to be dismissed by an either a monarch or viceregal representative. The Whitlam Government, while highly controversial during its short tenure, is credited with the implementation of major reforms.

"Pinot noir (French: [pino nwaʁ]) is a [[red]] wine [[grape]] variety of the species Vitis vinifera. The name may also refer to [[wines]] created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes.

Pinot noir is also a primary variety used in sparkling wine production in Champagne and other wine regions. It is widely considered to produce some of the finest wines in the world, but is a difficult variety to cultivate and transform into wine. The grape's tendency to produce tightly packed clusters makes it susceptible to several viticultural hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management. The thin-skins and low levels of phenolic compounds lends Pinot to producing mostly lightly colored, medium bodied low tannin wines that can often go through dumb phases with uneven and unpredictable aging. When young, wines made from Pinot noir tend to have red fruit aromas of cherries, raspberries and strawberries.

Over the years, the station successfully hosted a wide variety of programmes including soap operas, local and international news, educational documentaries such as the School Broadcasting Unit's show, which aired around 10a.m. on Mondays to Fridays when school was in session, and The Passing Parade hosted by John Doremus. The station's announcers included June Gonsalves, Barbara Assoon, Glen Antoine, Sam Ghany, Ken Laughlin, Hugh Blackman, Larry Heywood, Val Douglas, Russell Winston, Trevor McDonald, Holly Betaudier, Peter Minshall, Don Proudfoot, Bob Gittens and Raffie Knowles. Two of the most popular programmes were: \n*  Sunday Serenade, a show that featured performers of the day including the Mighty Sparrow and Ken Hutcheon), broadcast at noon on Sundays co-hosted by Bob Gittens and Sam Ghany. \n*  Auntie Kay, a children's talent show named after its presenter Kathleen Davis, which ran on Sundays at 2 p.m. and was sponsored by the Bermudez Biscuit Company. The back-up band was Choy Aming and the featured pianists were Aldwyn Albino and Dawlett Ahee. Among other regular features were the Cook Caribbean Jazz programme (which took its name from a Trinidad recording company, Cook Caribbean, that originally produced 78rpm records and later continued with the 33 1⁄3 format), and The Indian Hour at 6 p.m. every day. There was also a programme for children called Tell Me a Story with Auntie Wendy, and a classical music show entitled Music of the Masters. Radio Trinidad [[covered]] the many events linked with the thoroughbred horse breeding fostered by Trinidad and Tobago: horse races at the Queen's Park Savannah, in Port of Spain, at the Arima Race Track, at Union Park in San Fernando and at Shirvan Park on Tobago, and aired live commentary on races in Barbados. The main race and sporting commentator was Ralph Ellis Knowles, better known as Raffie Knowles, who was Head of Sports at the station for years. (When television came to Trinidad on Independence Day in 1962, he moonlighted there as Trinidad and Tobago Television's main sportscaster. Raffie's photographic memory enabled him to work without benefit of script or teleprompter, providing detailed scores, giving historical data and anecdotes on players and teams on a whole variety of sports and sporting personalities.) A sister station at 95 FM was officially launched in 1976; prior to that 95 FM merely broadcast the same programming as Radio Trinidad. The Radio Trinidad 730 AM frequency was dedicated to inspirational music and other church and religious broadcasting. Radio Trinidad ceased broadcasting on the AM band on Easter Sunday, 5 April 2015. The format (inspirational music and Christian broadcasting) of the AM frequency has now been vested in a new station, operating at 99.5 FM.

"Pierre Charles Fournier [[de]] [[Saint-Amant]] (12 [[September]] 1800 – 29 October 1872) was a leading French chess [[master]] and an [[editor]] of the chess periodical Le Palamède. He is best [[known]] for losing a match against Howard Staunton in 1843 that is [[often]] [[considered]] to have been an unofficial match for the [[World]] Chess Championship. Saint-Amant [[learned]] chess from Wilhelm [[Schlumberger]], who later became the operator of The Turk. He [[played]] at the Café [[de]] [[la]] Régence, where he was a student of Alexandre Deschapelles. [[For]] many years he played on level terms with Boncourt, a [[strong]] player, and received odds of pawn and two moves from Deschapelles and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. In 1834–36, he led a Paris team that won both games of a correspondence chess match against the Westminster Club, then England's leading chess club. After La Bourdonnais' death in 1840, he was considered the country's best player. In December 1841 he revived Le Palamède (at its inception in 1836 the world's first chess periodical), which ran until 1847. He played two matches against Staunton in 1843. The first, in London, he won 3½–2½ (three wins, one draw, two losses), but he lost a return match in Paris just before Christmas 13–8 (six wins, four draws, eleven losses). This second match is sometimes considered an unofficial world championship match. In 1858, Saint-Amant [[played]] in the Birmingham tournament, a knockout event. He won in the first round, but lost in the second by a 2–1 score to Ernst Falkbeer. Returning to Paris, he [[witnessed]] the adulatory reception accorded Paul Morphy at the Café de la Régence. The score of [[one]] game between them is known, a 22-move rout by Morphy of [[Saint-Amant]] and his consultation partner, given as \""F. de L.\"" or \""F. de L'A\"". Outside of chess, Saint-Amant became a government clerk in Paris at an early age. He then served as the secretary to the governor of French Guiana from 1819 to 1821. He was dismissed from that appointment after he protested against the slave trade that still existed in that colony. After that, he tried his hand as a journalist and actor, then became a successful wine merchant. He was a captain in the French National Guard during the 1848 revolution. For his role in saving the Palais des Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851–52, he was the French consul to California. Upon returning to France he spent some years writing well-regarded works on the French colonies, and a treatise on the wines of Bordeaux. In 1861 Saint-Amant retired to Algeria. He died there in 1872 after being thrown from his carriage.","Pierre Charles Fournier [[of]] [[tracy]] (12 [[september]] 1800 – 29 October 1872) was a leading French chess [[magazine]] and an [[editors]] of the chess periodical Le Palamède.

"Pierre Joseph Arthur Cardin, PC ([[June]] [[28]], 1879 – [[October]] 20, 1946) [[also]] known as [[Arthur]] Cardin was a Canadian politician who [[quit]] the cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King over the [[issue]] of conscription. Born in Sorel, Quebec, he was a [[lawyer]] before being elected to the Canadian House of [[Commons]] for the riding of Richelieu in the 1911 federal [[election]]. [[A]] Liberal, he was re-elected in every election he [[contested]] in Richelieu and, [[beginning]] in 1935, Richelieu—Verchères. He held four [[ministerial]] positions: Minister of Marine and [[Fisheries]], Minister of [[Marine]], Minister of Public Works, and Minister of Transport. Cardin [[called]] for a \""Yes\"" vote in the 1942 plebiscite to [[release]] the King government's from its pledge not to introduce conscription but [[resigned]] from Cabinet in [[May]] 1942 over the introduction of the National Resources [[Mobilization]] [[Act]] which gave the government the authority to do so when Mackenzie King was [[prepared]] to [[enable]] conscription through an Order in Council, although he had previously [[promised]] to [[seek]] a motion of confidence before bringing in mandatory military [[service]]. In April 1942, Cardin announced that he would be [[leading]] a slate of candidates in the [[June]] 1945 federal election most of whom were [[former]] Liberals who had left the party over the issue of conscription. The [[party]], which won the support of the \""Independent [[Group]]\"" of Quebec [[MPs]] led by Frédéric Dorion was to be [[known]] as the National Front and was [[considered]] more moderate than the Bloc populaire canadien. Among its [[policies]] was opposition to the \""socialism\"" the Mackenzie King government had introduced during the war, continued [[opposition]] to conscription, and bringing about greater national unity in Canada based on equality between French and English Canadians. [[However]], in May Cardin abandoned his plans for a [[new]] party on May 8, 1945, declaring his [[desire]] to use the new party to bring about the \""unity and [[equality]]\"" of both the province and the country as \""an illusion\"", due to the [[failure]] of the more radical Bloc populaire canadien and other [[nationalists]] to join his movement and unite behind his [[leadership]]. [[One]] serious problem for Cardin was hostility [[towards]] him from former Montreal mayor Camillien Houde who had been interned during the war for his [[opposition]] to conscription and was attempting to lead his own [[group]] of candidates in the 1945 election. Houde held [[Cardin]], who had been a member of Cabinet at the time of Houde's arrest, responsible for the [[decision]] to intern him.

After the signing of a Soviet-Mongolian mutual assistance treaty, units of the corps were deployed to Mongolia in March. On 8 June 1937 Davidovsky was arrested. On 19 August 1937 the 32nd Brigade became part of the 57th Special Rifle Corps as the Special Mechanized Brigade.

"St Reims (foaled 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[racehorse]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002. A million-dollar yearling, big things were always expected of the son of Zabeel, and although he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon started to live up to expectations. A runaway win in the Avondale Guineas at his last start before the Derby ensured that he would start favourite in the Classic, and he didn't disappoint. Given an excellent ride out in front by Greg Childs, the colt was never headed and scored a narrow but authoritative win. After the Derby his career went downhill. After disappointing performances in an autumn Sydney campaign, St Reims failed to win a single race as a four-year-old and looked to be a shadow of his former self. But at Hastings in the spring of 2004 he regained his interest in racing and put together a string of wins against horses the quality of Waitoki Dream and Zafar, culminating in a return to Group race success in the Lindauer Grandeur Stakes at Ellerslie, the scene of his Derby triumph. But he didn't stop there. He followed that win up with the Group 2 Counties Cup, a desperately close second under a demanding weight in the Group 2 Waikato Cup and a well-deserved second Group 1 victory in the Zabeel Classic at Ellerslie, just over two full years after his last Group 1 win. Following another Group 1 placing behind Xcellent in the Darley Stakes and a seventh behind the same horse in the Kelt Capital Stakes, he was retired to stand at Stoney Bridge Stud. St Reims had his first winner as a sire when two-year-old filly St J'adore, from his first crop, won a maiden race at Avondale on 7 May 2010.","St Reims (foaled 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[horse]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002.

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e [[Vittoriano]]) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Their Passio contains all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are [[genuine]] but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at Marsica. The earliest source on their life actually [[dates]] from a Passio of 1406. The Passio [[states]] that [[Simplicius]] and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of [[Simplicius]], became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while [[Simplicius]] and his two sons Constantius and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; [[Simplicius]] and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae. After the death of the three saints, an earthquake shook the town and one of the executioners was converted to Christianity, with the deacon named Florentius, a witness to the event, writing down and passing down the news of their deaths.","Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e [[gni]]) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century.
