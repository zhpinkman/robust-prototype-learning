"On 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in [[Latrobe]], Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda [[Gehrke]] of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the [[league's]] first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as [[surmised]] by the Chicago Tribune.

[[The]] museum is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the Sadhu [[Vaswani]] Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial [[experiences]] rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings – in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, [[holographic]] screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very [[emotive]] experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by [[ushers]] who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative.

The highway serves the communities of Graham and South Hill before reaching Puyallup and the communities of Edgewood, Milton, and Lakeland South before reaching Federal Way. [[rd]] 161 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering, replacing three Secondary State Highways (SSHs): Secondary State Highway 5D (SSH 5D) and SSH 5G, both established in 1937, and SSH 5N, established in 1955. SSH 5D served as a connector between Federal Way and Puyallup and SSH 5G served as a connector between Puyallup and South Hill. SSH 5N connected Eatonville to South Hill and was extended south towards La Grande in 1967. SR 161 was moved onto a bypass of Puyallup in the 1980s and formed concurrencies with SR 167 and SR 512 as a result. As of 2013, projects to expand the highway in Edgewood and Milton and adding new offramps at the I-5 and SR 18 interchange are in progress.",2

"Federal [[elections]] were held in Germany on 20 May [[1928]]. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats.

The coalition though, was [[plagued]] by internal [[divisions]] right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von [[Hindenburg]] for emergency powers.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off ([[also]] known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&[[W]]) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on [[December]] 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which [[included]] two [[large]] concrete viaducts that allowed for what was [[considered]] high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 [[km]]) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. [[The]] Cut-Off [[ran]] [[west]] for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris [[Junction]] — near the south end of [[Lake]] Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 [[miles]] (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford [[Junction]] [[near]] the [[Delaware]] [[Water]] [[Gap]] in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 [[km]]) [[shorter]] than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail [[line]] it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one [[permitting]] passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

All 73 structures on the [[line]] were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of [[tons]] of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

The [[win]] [[boats]] in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all [[remaining]] were relegated to the repechages. The repechages [[got]] the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final. [[quarterfinals]] in the repechages determined which semifinal the [[yacht]] would race in. [[a]] top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B [[finalist]], with the [[semifinal]] three boats going to the C/D semifinals. Six [[finalists]] were [[found]], two each of A/B semifinals, C/[[ds]] semifinals, and E/[[f]] semifinals. [[into]] each [[separate]] race, the top three boats moved on to the [[stronger]] of the two finals, while the [[top]] three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. [[that]] example, a second-place [[finished]] in an A/B semifinal [[might]] [[matter]] in advancement to the A final. The fourth and final [[system]] was the Finals. Each final determined a [[sort]] of [[ranking]]. [[an]] A [[last]] determined the medals, [[as]] with the rest of the places through 6th. [[those]] B final gave rankings from 7th to [[7th]], the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to [[have]] a medal rowers had to finish in the [[lowest]] four of their heat, top three of their [[semifinal]], and [[bottom]] three of their [[a]]/B semifinal to [[become]] the A final.",5

"The [[Journal]] of Economic Education (JEE) offers original peer-reviewed articles on teaching economics. The inaugural issue appeared in the fall of 1969. At the time, G.L. Bach (Stanford University) wrote in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings (1971) that the JEE was to be the forum for scholarly work in economic education, primarily at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities, but including junior colleges and, to some extent, the high schools. In the early days, the Council for Economic Education (then call the Joint Council and later the National Council) oversaw publication of the JEE, and members of the American Economic Association Committee on Economic Education served as the editorial board, with Henry Villard (City University of New York) serving as editor. The Council for Economic Education assigned the JEE copyright and publishing responsibility to the nonprofit Heldref Publications in 1981. The Council, however, retained responsibility for appointing the editor and providing financial support to the editorial office. In 1983, Donald Paden (University of Illinois) became editor when the JEE expanded to a quarterly publication. Kalman Goldberg (Bradley University) became editor in 1986.

The inaugural issue appeared in the fall of 1969. At the time, G.L. Bach (Stanford University) wrote in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings (1971) that the JEE was to be the forum for scholarly work in economic education, primarily at the undergraduate level in colleges and universities, but including junior colleges and, to some extent, the high schools. In the early days, the Council for Economic Education (then call the Joint Council and later the National Council) oversaw publication of the JEE, and members of the American Economic Association Committee on Economic Education served as the editorial board, with Henry Villard (City University of New York) serving as editor. The Council for Economic Education assigned the JEE copyright and publishing responsibility to the nonprofit Heldref Publications in 1981. The Council, however, retained responsibility for appointing the editor and providing financial support to the editorial office. In 1983, Donald Paden (University of Illinois) became editor when the JEE expanded to a quarterly publication. Kalman Goldberg (Bradley University) became editor in 1986.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which would [[serve]] the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. The [[line]] is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards [[connecting]] it to the Oslo Metro. The [[line]] has at various stages been proposed as a automated [[people]] mover, tram-train, tramway, light rail, stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it.

It has a hub at the downtown Canby Transit Center. CAT was established as a department of the City of Canby on January 1, 2002 upon Canby's withdrawal from the TriMet service area, and had an official dedication on August 20, 2002. Canby paid TriMet to continue service in the interim, and replaced TriMet's commuter runs in 2004, which received little ridership at the end. CAT also expanded service within the city of Canby, to Woodburn and to Wilsonville, the latter in partnership with Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit. Canby replaced TriMet's payroll tax with its own within the city, but at a somewhat lower rate, and also receives state and federal grants. Due to the loss of state tax credits and recession-caused tax revenue decreases, CAT had to eliminate Saturday service, fixed-route service within Canby and trips to Wilsonville, as well as started charging a $1 fare. In exchange, they started to allow the general public to use dial-a-ride service within Canby that was previously limited to eligible disabled riders, and SMART continued to operate its trips from Wilsonville.","Canby Area [[line]], or simply CAT, is the public transit bus [[serving]] provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

"Pinot noir (French: [pino [[nwaʁ]]]) is a red wine grape variety of the species [[Vitis]] [[vinifera]]. The name may also refer to wines created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes.

"St Reims (foaled 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[racehorse]] who won the New [[Zealand]] Derby in 2002. [[A]] million-dollar yearling, big things were [[always]] expected of the son of Zabeel, and [[although]] he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon [[started]] to [[live]] up to expectations.

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus ([[Victorian]](us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century.

Finally, on [[August]] [[26]], 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), [[identified]] by the writer of the Passio as the future [[site]] of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S.

Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood.

"Free Society (1895-1897 as The Firebrand; 1897-1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist [[newspaper]] in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Most anarchist publications in the US were in Yiddish, German, or Russian, but Free Society was published in English, permitting the dissemination of anarchist thought to English-speaking populations in the US. The newspaper was established as The Firebrand in 1895 in Portland, Oregon by the Isaak family, Abraham Isaak, Mary Isaak, and their children, along with some associates; the organization served as \""the headquarters of anarchist activity on the [West] Coast\"". The paper was particularly known for its advocacy of free love and women's rights, bringing an anarchist critique to bear on social and gender relations. Deliberately defying the Comstock laws in an act of civil disobedience, The Firebrand published Walt Whitman's \""A Woman Waits for Me\"" in 1897; A.J. Pope, Abe Isaak, and Henry Addis were quickly arrested and charged with publishing obscene information for the Whitman poem and a letter \""It Depends on the Women\"", signed by A.E.K. The A.E.K. letter presented various hypotheticals of women refusing or assenting to sex with their husbands or lovers, and argued that true liberation required education of both sexes and particularly women.

"[[Presidential]] [[elections]] were held in France on 24 April and 8 [[May]] 1988. In 1981, the Socialist Party leader, François [[Mitterrand]], was elected President of France and the Left won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the right regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the [[RPR]] leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \""reserved domain\"" – foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates opposed the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet advocated [[liberal-conservative]] policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by President Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was challenged by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", claiming that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth Republic\"". He appeared as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he announced his candidacy, Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by [[SOFRES]] polls institute, against 23% for Barre. But, from the start of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and took the lead among the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist candidate was uncertain. Mitterrand said he was not sure he would run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel [[Rocard]] campaigned for the nomination. The favourite to win the [[election]] according to the polls, the incumbent president announced his candidacy at the end of March. [[He]] wrote an open letter to the French, where he proposed a moderate programme (\""neither nationalisations, nor privatizations\"") and advocated a \""united France\"" against \""the appropriation of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the RPR. He benefited from the decline of the French Communist Party, represented by André Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \""reforming Communist\"", Pierre Juquin and a Trotskyist, Arlette Laguiller. Meanwhile, the Ecologist Antoine Waechter refused to ally the Greens with either the left or the right. On the far-right, the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, tried to confirm the FN's good result in the previous legislative election. The French economy shrugging off the early 1980s recession with 4% growth that year put the economy off the mind's of voters as well as popular social programs being implemented, both of which gave Mitterrand the economic argument to achieve a second term despite the fallback in the last legislative election that caused cohabitation.","[[presidential]] [[recounts]] were held in France on 24 April and 8 [[can]] 1988.

"Bedwetters are an Estonian pop punk [[band]] formed in September 2004. They became well recognized in the spring of 2007 when they won the most prestigious contest for Estonian new groups. One of the main prizes of the competition Bedwetters won, was the possibility to shoot a music video with acclaimed Estonian music video director Masa (Supersonic). Video for \""Dramatic Letter To Conscience\"" received the highest possible rotation on MTV Baltic and band became hugely popular in all three Baltic countries after which they became one of the few Baltic acts that were nominated in the MTV EMA Munich 2007 New Sounds of Europe category. On November 1 a miracle happened - when Nelly Furtado and Snoop Dogg handed them the MTV award, they became the first Estonian artist ever to receive an MTV prize. In spring 2008, Bedwetters was a support act for Good Charlotte & Avril Lavigne in Tallinn and spent the summer touring in the Baltics sharing the festival stages with the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Reamonn, Justice and many more. In summer 2008, Bedwetters was signed to a Swedish record label I Can Hear Music (TMC Entertainment) and the work on the debut album could begin. Petter Lantz (ex-Lambretta) was chosen to produce the material that the guys had written during spring & summer 2008. Band headed to the studio in December and recording was finished in the end of January 2009. \""Meet the fucking Bedwetters\"" was released in Estonia and the world (iTunes) on the 20th of April 2009.

"The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland and, formerly, in Germany) or ICE (German pronunciation: [iːtseːˈʔeː]) is a [[system]] of high-speed trains predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service category offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam. On 10 June 2007, a new line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart was opened, jointly operated by ICE and TGV trains. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2018. While ICE 3M trains operate the Paris-Frankfurt service (with the exception of trains 9553/9552, which operate with TGV Duplex equipment and are cross-crewed with both SNCF and DB staff), SNCF's TGV runs from Paris to Munich (via Stuttgart), with mixed crews on both trains. German and Austrian ICE T trains run to Vienna. On 9 December 2007, the ICE TD was introduced on the service from Berlin via Hamburg to the Danish cities of Aarhus and Copenhagen.

"The Cimmeron Show Review was originally a 1960s Revival [[Band]] originating in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA in 1972. The group originally consisted of four University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh students, Phil Barry, Scott Nelson, Gregg Tipple, and R.B.Smith. When they first started, the idea of the band was to make some extra money while they were in school. That plan included disbanding the group at graduation, which they did in the summer of 1973. After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B. Smith and Phil Barry returned to Oshkosh from New York and Chicago, respectively, and reformed the band in the spring of 1974. Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow. With some creative marketing, they became a headliner band in a very short period of time. They had a large fan base and enjoyed considerable popularity in the Midwest from 1972 through 1979. Although there were brief stints by Bass Players Larry Wolf and Bobby Way, the majority of their 9-year run consisted of Phil Barry, R.B.Smith, Scott Nelson, and Jeff Kannenberg.

"For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., [[transported]] people across the city and region. The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District. For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified. A bit later, the extensive mergers dubbed the \""Great Streetcar Consolidation\"" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses. After a strike in 1955, the company changed ownership and became DC Transit, with explicit instructions to switch to buses. The system was dismantled in the early 1960s and the last streetcar ran on January 28, 1962.

Despite the Liberal Party's determination to make their policy of privatisation of public infrastructure work, the private sector in Hobart, which is a relatively small market, was already well served by Calvary Hospital, St Johns [[Calvary]] Hospital and St Helens Private Hospital, and Hobart Private was experiencing financial difficulties within months of opening.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Middle Creek was an engagement fought January 10, 1862, in Eastern Kentucky during the American Civil [[War]]. More than a month after Confederate Colonel John S. Williams left Kentucky, following the fight at Ivy Mountain, Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall led another force into Eastern Kentucky to continue recruiting [[activities]]. From his headquarters in Paintsville, on the Levisa Fork of the [[Big]] Sandy [[River]], northwest of Prestonsburg, [[Marshall]] recruited volunteers. He [[raised]] a [[force]] of more than 2,000 men by [[early]] January, but [[could]] only partially equip them. Union Brig. Gen. [[Don]] Carlos Buell directed Col. [[James]] [[A]]. Garfield to [[force]] Marshall to [[retreat]] back into Virginia. Leaving Louisa, Garfield [[took]] [[command]] of the 18th Brigade and began his [[march]] south on Paintsville. He compelled the Confederates to [[abandon]] [[Paintsville]] and [[retreat]] to the vicinity of Prestonsburg. Garfield slowly headed south, but [[swampy]] [[areas]] and numerous streams slowed his movements, and he [[arrived]] in the [[vicinity]] of Marshall on the 9th. Heading out at 4:00 a.m. on [[January]] 10, Garfield [[marched]] a mile west near the Forks of Middle [[Creek]], fought off the Confederate cavalry, and turned [[west]] to [[attack]] Marshall. Marshall had put his [[men]] in line of battle north and east of the creek near its forks. Garfield [[attacked]] shortly after noon, and the fighting continued for most of the afternoon until Union [[reinforcements]] arrived in time to dissuade the Confederates from assailing the Federal [[left]]. [[Instead]], the Confederates retired south and were ordered [[back]] to Virginia on January [[24]]. Garfield's force moved to Prestonsburg after the fight and then retired to [[Paintsville]].

More than a month after Confederate Colonel John S. Williams left Kentucky, following the fight at Ivy Mountain, Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall led another force into Eastern Kentucky to continue recruiting [[people]]. From his headquarters in Paintsville, on the Levisa Fork of the [[lost]] Sandy [[river]], northwest of Prestonsburg, [[marshall]] recruited volunteers. He [[mobilized]] a [[forces]] of more than 2,000 men by [[later]] January, but [[might]] only partially equip them. Union Brig. Gen. [[winfield]] Carlos Buell directed Col. [[james]] [[se]]. Garfield to [[command]] Marshall to [[force]] back into Virginia. Leaving Louisa, Garfield [[takes]] [[care]] of the 18th Brigade and began his [[way]] south on Paintsville. He compelled the Confederates to [[abandoning]] [[wheeling]] and [[retreating]] to the vicinity of Prestonsburg. Garfield slowly headed south, but [[overgrown]] [[land]] and numerous streams slowed his movements, and he [[walked]] in the [[surroundings]] of Marshall on the 9th. Heading out at 4:00 a.m. on [[jan]] 10, Garfield [[walked]] a mile west near the Forks of Middle [[run]], fought off the Confederate cavalry, and turned [[sharp]] to [[face]] Marshall. Marshall had put his [[lines]] in line of battle north and east of the creek near its forks. Garfield [[awoke]] shortly after noon, and the fighting continued for most of the afternoon until Union [[counterattack]] arrived in time to dissuade the Confederates from assailing the Federal [[flanks]]. [[here]], the Confederates retired south and were ordered [[forward]] to Virginia on January [[23rd]]. Garfield's force moved to Prestonsburg after the fight and then retired to [[gettysburg]].
