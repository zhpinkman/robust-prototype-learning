The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story.

"Balaji Baji Rao (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), also known as Nana Saheb, was a Peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire in India.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"[[The]] Grand Rapids Hotel also [[known]] as the [[The]] Grand Rapids Resort, was a hotel that existed outside of Mount Carmel, Illinois in [[Wabash]] County, Illinois, United States in Southern Illinois from 1922 to 1929.

Before the hotel was built, the property where the hotel was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman for multiple small shops that sold goods to fisherman and tourists.

[[DThe]] [[Qhotel]] was [[on]] of the first major [[resort]] on the southern portion of the [[Wbaash]] River and quickly was able to attract tourist from across the country because of its location on the river and ease of access provided by the railroad. During its 9-year existence the hotel established a reputation for luxury and high quality. In later years, after manager Glenn Goodart took over operation of the hotel it gradually began to [[los]] patronage due to incompetent business planning and flooding of the [[Wabagh]] River in the summers of 1927, 1928, and 1929. On July 29, 1929 Glenn Goodart burned the [[rand]] [[Raids]] Hotel to the ground by dropping a [[bloworch]] in the basement shop. Three months before Goodart burned the hotel down, the [[Uinted]] States Senate Committee on Commerce had decided to remove the Grand Rapids Dam by [[reovking]] funding. Due to the onset of the Great Depression shortly after the hotel was burned down it was not rebuilt. The same year Goodart burned the hotel down he was elected as [[FinanCe]] Commissioner for [[Waash]] County, Illinois.",2

"[[The]] Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived [[Women's]] Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by [[Medeski]] and members of the North Mississippi [[Allstars]], both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoolie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to [[Slateford]] Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the [[Lackawanna's]] 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into [[Conrail]] in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the [[right-of-way]] to private developers.

"Cagliostro-Walzer [[op]].[[370]] is a waltz by Johann Strauss [[II]] composed in [[1875]] based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on [[27]] February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien. The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' ich mit Ihnen fliegen [[durchs]] Leben\"" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta. The operetta itself was a success at its first performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera [[composers]] to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be arranged as a [[new]] piece to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this '[[Cagliostro-Walzer']]. The [[entire]] waltz consists of just 3 [[two-part]] waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part sections [[heard]] in his earlier works. The [[piece]] began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. [[The]] principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of [[The]] Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief [[coda]] enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated.

The [[entinre]] waltz consists of just 3 [[two-art]] waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part sections [[hear]] in his earlier works. The [[pieec]] began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. [[he]] principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of [[he]] Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief [[aoda]] enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated. After a short [[chorde]] passage, the swirling Waltz [[A]] recurs and Strauss signs off the waltz with a strong chord and long [[snaer-drumroll]].",1
"The Newcastle [[Jets]] 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] [[since]] the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000.

Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal.

[[t]] was launched on a [[fimve-day]] trial basis against the backdrop of a general decline in newspaper sales, with an initial print-run of 60,000 copies for its first edition, but this was increased the following day as a result of public demand, and Newsquest decided to print it on a permanent basis after healthy sales continued throughout the first week. By January 2015, daily sales had fallen to below 20,000. The first front page carried a story about charities urging [[devoletion]] of powers over welfare legislation to Scotland. Reception to the [[newspapee's]] launch was mixed in both media and political circles. Libby Brooks of The Guardian praised the depth of its news coverage, but suggested announcing its launch at an SNP event could prove \""auspicious\"", while the Labour peer George [[Foulks]] branded it \""McPravda\"". However, the Scottish journalist and broadcaster Lesley Riddoch was more positive, feeling its launch could be a \""sound business move\"" by its publishers. Upon its [[lunch]], The National stated that it is a separate entity from the SNP.",1

The Passio states that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons Constantius and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they [[preached]] the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight [[erupting]] between the Christians and [[pagans]]; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S.

This magazine was published a couple of times in 1996 and 1997 before folding. In 1999, Shueisha revived the Ribon Teens concept in a new magazine which soon received the title Cookie. The first issue of Cookie was soon published and the second issue followed in 2000 and being published on the 26th of each month. At that time, the former Bouquet editing department was made into the Cookie editing department. The editor-in-chief had been a former editor-in-chief of [[Ribbon]]. Cookie began being published monthly starting from the May 2000 issue, and switched to being published bimonthly in July 2012. Today, the manga artists featured in Cookie are a [[mixure]] of former Bouquet manga artists (some series that ran in Bouquet, such as Toriko [[Chiha's]] Clover and Yumi [[kefuji's]] Zoccha no [[Nichiou]], were transferred to [[CookXe]]) and former Ribon manga artists such as Miho Obana and Ai Yazawa. There are also some new manga artists as well. Perhaps the most popular manga in Cookie is Nana. It was one of the first manga to run in Cookie and still continues today, and is also being [[publishe]] in many other countries [[avound]] the world.",1

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky. In 1982, Ten Broeck was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.","Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorsPe]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks.
