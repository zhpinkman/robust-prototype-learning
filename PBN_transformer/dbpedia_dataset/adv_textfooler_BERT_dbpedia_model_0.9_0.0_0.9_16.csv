In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players.

The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle.

"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an [[American]] 20th century [[movie]] theater [[designer]] and later the [[chief]] [[architect]] for [[Eastern]] [[College]].

[[Lee]] [[attended]] Trinity College for a [[year]], before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles.

"Perfect Records was a [[United]] States-based [[record]] [[label]] founded in 1922 by Pathé [[Records]] to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. [[Their]] slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of [[records]] by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day.

"(For their \""best of\"" album, see The Best of Judas Priest: Living After Midnight.) \""Living After Midnight\"" is a [[song]] by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It was originally featured on their 1980 album British Steel, which was their first gold album in the United States selling more than 500,000 copies (and eventually went platinum for selling at least 1 million).

On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing. For example, on the DVD Rising in the East, lead vocalist Rob Halford sings, \""I took the Budokan 'bout one a.m.\"", in reference to the stadium in Tokyo, Japan, that hosted the concert. On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the new wave of British heavy metal movement).

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The [[brewery]] is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Blithering]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging [[lends]] additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste.

"[[Steven]] [[Lynn]] \""[[Steve]]\"" Beshear ([[born]] [[September]] 21, 1944) is an [[American]] [[attorney]] and [[Democratic]] [[Party]] politician who was the 61st [[Governor]] of [[Kentucky]] from 2007 to 2015. [[He]] served in the Kentucky [[House]] of [[Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the state's [[Attorney]] [[General]] from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] from 1983 to 1987. [[After]] graduating from the [[University]] of Kentucky [[College]] of Law in 1968, Beshear [[briefly]] [[practiced]] [[law]] in [[New]] York before [[returning]] to [[Kentucky]] and being elected to the state [[legislature]], where he [[gained]] a [[reputation]] as a [[consumer]] [[advocate]]. [[He]] parlayed that [[reputation]] into a [[term]] as attorney [[general]], [[serving]] under [[Governor]] [[John]] Y. Brown, Jr. As [[attorney]] [[general]], Beshear issued an opinion that [[copies]] of the Ten Commandments would [[have]] to [[be]] [[removed]] from the [[walls]] of the state's classrooms in the wake of the [[U]].S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. [[He]] also [[clashed]] with first [[lady]] Phyllis [[George]] Brown when he [[opposed]] the [[practice]] of charging an admission [[fee]] for [[visitors]] to [[view]] the renovated governor's [[mansion]]. [[In]] 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the [[administration]] of Governor Martha [[Layne]] Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the [[formation]] of the Kentucky Tomorrow [[Commission]], a panel charged with [[making]] [[recommendations]] for the [[future]] of the state. Beshear's initial [[rise]] to [[political]] prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial [[primary]] election. The Beshear campaign's [[sparring]] with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place [[finisher]] in the [[primary]], opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind [[upset]] in the race. [[For]] the next 20 [[years]], Beshear [[practiced]] [[law]] at a [[Lexington]] [[law]] firm. [[His]] only [[foray]] into [[politics]] during this [[period]] was an [[unsuccessful]] [[challenge]] to Senator [[Mitch]] [[McConnell]] in 1996. [[In]] 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into [[politics]] by the [[vulnerability]] of [[incumbent]] [[Republican]] [[Governor]] [[Ernie]] [[Fletcher]], whose [[administration]] was under [[extended]] investigation by then-Attorney [[General]] [[Greg]] Stumbo, over [[violations]] of the state's [[merit]] [[system]].
