"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","[[as]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixtures]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011.

Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""[[super-railroad]]\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it [[superseded]]; it had a [[much]] gentler ruling gradient (0.55% [[vs]]. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 [[mph]] (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",5

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – [[November]] 1972) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international.

"The Hammersmith & City [[line]] of the London Underground runs between Hammersmith and Barking. Coloured salmon pink on the tube map, it serves 29 stations in 15.8 miles (25.5 km). It runs below ground in the central section between Paddington and Bow Road; between Farringdon and Aldgate East it skirts the City of London, the capital's financial heart. The tunnels are just below the surface and are a similar size to those on British main lines. Most of the track and all stations are shared with the District, Circle or Metropolitan lines, the other parts of London Underground's sub-surface railway, and over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year on this line and the Circle line. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway began the world's first underground railway service between Paddington and Farringdon with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The following year, a railway west from Paddington to Hammersmith was opened and this soon became operated and owned jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western railways. The line was then extended to the east, in stages, reaching the East London Railway in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906, and, in 1936, after the Metropolitan Railway had been absorbed by London Passenger Transport Board, some Hammersmith & City trains were extended over the former District Railway line to Barking. The Hammersmith & City route was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, since when it has appeared as a separate line.

"Fred Warren Waters ([[February]] [[2]], 1927 – August 28, 1989) was an [[American]] [[professional]] baseball player, manager, scout and coach. [[The]] left-handed pitcher appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955–1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. [[Born]] in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the University of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949–58; 1960–62) pitching [[career]] in minor league baseball. He was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one [[trade]] in Major League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. [[Waters]] appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the [[Open-Classification]] Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and [[sat]] out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.","Fred Warren Waters ([[month]] [[20th]], 1927 – August 28, 1989) was an [[american]] [[career]] baseball player, manager, scout and coach.

The league was created to [[accommodate]] the travel restrictions put in place because of World [[War]] I and the 1918 flu pandemic, which [[required]] a delay in the start of the season (not starting until October 27) and [[prevented]] Buffalo's teams from leaving the city. [[Because]] of the greatly fewer number of teams playing across the country in 1918, the Niagaras had greater access to the remaining players who were not in the war. The 1918 Niagaras, whose name was borrowed from an [[earlier]] (and later) semi-pro team, were the [[first]] Buffalo team to [[employ]] [[former]] Michigan Wolverines and Youngstown Patricians quarterback Ernest \""Tommy\"" Hughitt; Hughitt [[would]] [[go]] on to play for the Prospects and its [[NFL]] successors through 1924 and live in Buffalo for the rest of his life. Under Hughitt's leadership, Buffalo dominated the makeshift four-team league and [[compiled]] a perfect season of five wins, a [[sixth]] [[game]] was scheduled but canceled due to it being rendered moot. [[Only]] in one game did the Niagaras give up any points at all, surrendering a [[single]] touchdown and extra point to the [[Buffalo]] Hydraulics through the [[entire]] season. Because of the travel [[restrictions]], the Niagaras were not allowed to challenge the other teams in the nation (such as the first-place Dayton Triangles, the still-active Detroit Heralds or [[even]] Buffalo's regional [[rivals]], the Rochester Jeffersons), leaving it unknown how the team [[would]] have [[fared]] compared to the rest of the country.","The [[18th]] Buffalo [[highlanders]] season was a top-level semi-professional football team in Buffalo, New York.

"The Somonyng of Everyman ([[The]] Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late [[15th-century]] morality [[play]].

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) ([[Italian]]: Simplicio, Costanzo [[e]] Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd [[century]]. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. [[Their]] Passio [[contains]] all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed [[together]] at Marsica. The earliest source on their [[life]] actually dates from a Passio of 1406. The Passio [[states]] that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons [[Constantius]] and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae. After the death of the three saints, an earthquake shook the town and one of the executioners was converted to Christianity, with the deacon named Florentius, a witness to the event, writing down and passing down the news of their deaths.","Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) ([[italian]]: Simplicio, Costanzo [[della]] Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd [[time]].

"The Vancouver Dragons were a professional basketball [[team]] in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams.

"The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland and, formerly, in Germany) or ICE (German pronunciation: [iːtseːˈʔeː]) is a [[system]] of high-speed trains predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service category offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam. On 10 June 2007, a new line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart was opened, jointly operated by ICE and TGV trains. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2018.

At its west end near Belt Line Road in Irving, State Highway 161 (SH 161) continues southwest to Interstate 20 (I-20) in Grand Prairie. The discontinuous free frontage roads along the turnpike from I-35E in Carrollton east to its end at I-30 in Garland are assigned the State Highway 190 (SH 190) designation. SH 190 signage appears only along the Garland, Richardson, Plano, and Carrollton sections of the frontage road with the undersign \""frontage road only\"". At intersections with city streets, only the Bush Turnpike signs are displayed, not the SH 190 signage. Prior to the construction of the main lanes as a tollway, SH 190 was used as the name of the planned main lanes too. Similarly, the part west of I-35E was planned as part of SH 161. Bush Turnpike is signed as a north–south road from I-20 to I-35E (the \""Western Extension\""), an east–west road from I-35E to the Merritt Main Lane Gantry (the original sections) and as a north–south road from the Merritt Main Lane Gantry to I-30 (the \""Eastern Extension\""), as Bush Turnpike makes a nearly 90-degree curve in both places.

Currently, all maintenance is done under a five-year total routine maintenance (TRM) [[contract]] with Roy Jorgensen Associates, Inc. based in Buckeystown, Maryland, that started in November 2011. The turnpike passes through three Texas counties (Dallas, Collin and Denton) and nine Dallas suburbs (Rowlett, Sachse, Garland, Richardson, Plano, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving and Grand Prairie). Originally the PGBT was equipped with traditional toll plazas for cash payment as well as RFID-based TollTag express lanes. However, on July 1, 2009 the cash plazas were closed and replaced with \""ZipCash\"", an OCR-based camera system which reads the license plate and bills the owner by mail. This made the turnpike the first in the United States to transition to all-electronic toll collection. The ZipCash rates, however, come at a premium being significantly higher than both the TollTag rate and the earlier cash prices.","The President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) is a 52-mile (84 km) toll [[routes]] running through the northern, northeastern and western suburbs, forming a partial loop around Dallas, Texas, United States.

"The citizens of Poland have the world's highest count of individuals who have been recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations for saving Jews from extermination during the [[Holocaust]] in World War II. There are 6,620 Polish men and women recognized as Righteous to this day, over a quarter of the total number of 26,120 awards. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Poles concealed and aided hundreds of thousands of their Polish-Jewish neighbors. Many of these initiatives were carried out by individuals, but there also existed organized networks of Polish resistance which were dedicated to aiding Jews – most notably, the Żegota organization.

"[[Cape]] Horn (Dutch: , Spanish: Cabo de Hornos), named after the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands, is the southernmost [[headland]] of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of southern Chile, and is [[located]] on the small Hornos Island. Although not the most southerly [[point]] of South America (which are the Diego Ramírez Islands), Cape [[Horn]] [[marks]] the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and [[marks]] where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans collide. [[For]] [[decades]] it was a [[major]] milestone on the clipper route, by which sailing [[ships]] carried trade [[around]] the world. The [[waters]] around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, [[owing]] to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and [[Icebergs]]; these dangers have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard. The [[need]] for [[ships]] to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the [[opening]] of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing [[around]] the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major [[challenges]] in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point). Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the VELUX 5 Oceans, and the Vendée Globe, sail around the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route.

"Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[center]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered. Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, founder of Still Mind Zendo, has been a Zen teacher since 2000 prior to which she was in private practice as a spiritual director for 15 years, also working as a community organizer and peace activist. She is married to Sensei Gregory Abels and they are the parents of a grown daughter. Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels is co-resident teacher at Still Mind Zendo. As well as being a Zen teacher, he has enjoyed a 50 year career as an actor, theatre director and Master Teacher of Acting and is also a poet, his writing being informed by his Zen practice.

"The Army of the Danube (French: [[Armée]] du Danube) was a field [[army]] of the French Directory in the 1799 southwestern campaign in the Upper Danube valley. [[It]] was formed on 2 March 1799 by the simple expedient of renaming the Army of Observation, which had been observing Austrian movements on the border between French [[First]] Republic and the Holy Roman Empire. [[It]] was commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Comte Jourdan (1762–1833). The formation of the army was [[part]] of the French Directory's long term strategy to undermine Habsburg influence in the Holy Roman [[Empire]], and, conversely, to strengthen French hegemony in central Europe after the wars of the First Coalition and the [[Treaty]] of Campo Formio in 1797. Despite the Treaty, Austria and France remained [[suspicious]] of each other's motives, and the purpose of the Army of the Observation was to [[watch]] for [[Austrian]] border transgressions.

"Jazz FM, is a radio [[station]] broadcasting on digital radio in the United Kingdom which predominantly plays jazz music, jazz standards as well as blues and soul music. The station also plays specialist programming in a wide variety of jazz disciplines.

The station started off as a separate website named ejazz as an accompaniment to the now defunct 102.2 Jazz FM and 100.4 Jazz FM stations in London and the North West respectively. GMG Radio revamped the site in 2004 and in 2005 when the London Jazz FM station was replaced with 102.2 Smooth FM, the ejazz website adopted the Jazz FM name and moved to jazzfm.com. Jazzfm.com also took up DAB slots in Yorkshire, South Wales and the Severn Estuary to relay the Blue Room stream of smooth jazz and funk music from the website at a higher bitrate, which were left vacant by the defunct Smooth Digital radio station. GMG also launched jazzfm.com on free-to-air digital satellite via the Sky platform, but closed it down in 2006 to save money to re-invest into the website. The station also took spare slots when GMG Radio bought the Saga radio stations across the UK, but also sold jazzfm.com DAB slots to a number of buyers, including Leeds United F.C. and United Christian Broadcasters. In 2008, GMG made plans to relaunch Jazz FM in a move to encourage Ofcom to remove jazz commitments from the licences of 102.2 Smooth Radio and 100.4 Smooth Radio. The format change was denied but GMG promised to continue its plans to relaunch jazzfm.com as Jazz FM, including a three-year licensing deal with The Local Radio Company. In January 2009, The Local Radio Company placed the station up for sale.

The two expansion teams were denied early draft picks in the first season, but the Grizzlies secured Shareef Abdur-Rahim in 1996. The team continued to lose games despite high draft picks. After they selected Steve Francis as second pick in 1999, he refused to play in Vancouver and was traded away. After the 1998–99 lockout, lower attendance and a weak Canadian dollar caused the owner Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment to start losing money on the franchise. After a failed attempt to sell the team to Bill Laurie, it was instead sold to Michael Heisley and subsequently moved to Memphis, Tennessee for the 2001–02 season.",0

"Eén NL (One NL) is a Dutch political [[party]] founded in September 2006. It took part in the 2006 Dutch election under the leadership of Marco Pastors and Joost Eerdmans, but a dismal election result leaves the political future of the party quite uncertain. The party is seen as one of the political heirs of the late Pim [[Fortuyn]]. The Eén in the name Eén NL, meaning 'one', emphasizes national unity where NL is the standard abbreviation of the Netherlands. The party broadly stands for opposition to mass immigration to the Netherlands, tax cutting and shrinking government, zero tolerance on crime, constitutional reform (particularly more direct democracy and the direct election of the prime minister and members of parliament), restoring the \""human dimension\"" in large public sectors such as education and health care, and a skeptical attitude to European integration.

Several moderate Muslims support the party. On September 20, 2006, Anton van Schijndel, formerly of the VVD, joined the party and on September 24 he and Eerdmans formed a new parliamentary group with the provisional name Groep Eerdmans-Van Schijndel.

A lawsuit filed against Pastors by the political opponent Moslim Democratische Partij was not honored, the judge argued that although the remark was sensitive it was not outside the bounds of law as it remarked not on Islam itself but on islamization as a civic phenomenon.","Eén NL (One NL) is a Dutch political [[paper]] founded in September 2006. It took part in the 2006 Dutch election under the leadership of Marco Pastors and Joost Eerdmans, but a dismal election result leaves the political future of the party quite uncertain. The party is seen as one of the political heirs of the late Pim [[het]]. The Eén in the name Eén NL, meaning 'one', emphasizes national unity where NL is the standard abbreviation of the Netherlands. The party broadly stands for opposition to mass immigration to the Netherlands, tax cutting and shrinking government, zero tolerance on crime, constitutional reform (particularly more direct democracy and the direct election of the prime minister and members of parliament), restoring the \""human dimension\"" in large public sectors such as education and health care, and a skeptical attitude to European integration.

"Concord Area [[Transit]] (CAT) is the primary provider of public transportation in [[Concord]], New Hampshire, United States.

[[In]] 1989, the City of Concord went out to bid for public transit service. Since high bids came in to [[operate]] the service, the city's mayor appointed a committee made up of supporters and detractors of the bus service. The outcome was to approach the Community Action Program Belknap-Merrimack Counties, Inc. (CAPBMCI) to [[provide]] the service. CAPBMCI [[operated]] and continues to operate senior bus service in the region and, therefore, was in a position to step up to the plate. [[The]] agreement was that the city would [[provide]] match support (annual federal grants for transit [[require]] a 20% or 50% match depending on the [[type]] of funding) to purchase buses and three years of [[operating]] support as a pilot program. A City of [[Concord]] [[Advisory]] [[Committee]] would work with CAPBMCI. CAPBMCI began CAT and still [[operates]] it as one of its programs and transportation systems. [[From]] CAT's inception, it included fixed-route service as [[well]] as weekday service for seniors and people with disabilities. [[The]] [[routes]] were from Concord Heights to [[Concord]] Hospital and from Penacook to the South [[End]] of Concord, along with service for people with disabilities and seniors. [[At]] this time, the first Orion buses were [[used]] on the routes. Trolley-shaped buses were rented and [[operated]] during the six-week holiday season for three years. These trolleys were [[supported]] by the Chamber of Commerce, Concord Hospital and Steeplegate [[Mall]]. CAMBMCI [[also]] [[assumed]] operation of senior service that had been [[operated]] by the [[YMCA]]. [[In]] 1991, the City of [[Concord]] began to [[provide]] CAPBMCI with ongoing funding to [[support]] public transportation beyond the three-year pilot. In 1999, the Americans with Disabilities Act ([[ADA]]) mandated specific [[regulations]] for bus service for people with disabilities. [[Since]] CAT already provided such service, it ensured that it conformed to the [[new]] ADA regulations. [[In]] 1999, CAT also operated the Penacook, Heights, [[Manchester]] [[Street]] and senior service routes. Manchester Street service was funded through a three-year Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) [[grant]]. By 2005, CAT had started a Crosstown bus service between Airport Road and Concord Hospital. The Crosstown bus developed into the Industrial Park route that operates between Industrial Park Drive and the hospital today. CAT started year-round trolley service in 2008 when it received a three-year CMAQ grant. The matching funds for this grant were generously donated by Delta Dental.

[[the]] [[journeys]] were from Concord Heights to [[concord]] Hospital and from Penacook to the South [[end]] of Concord, along with service for people with disabilities and seniors. [[during]] this time, the first Orion buses were [[displayed]] on the routes. Trolley-shaped buses were rented and [[displayed]] during the six-week holiday season for three years. These trolleys were [[followed]] by the Chamber of Commerce, Concord Hospital and Steeplegate [[mall]]. CAMBMCI [[similarly]] [[provided]] operation of senior service that had been [[pioneered]] by the [[ymca]]. [[by]] 1991, the City of [[concord]] began to [[assist]] CAPBMCI with ongoing funding to [[deliver]] public transportation beyond the three-year pilot. In 1999, the Americans with Disabilities Act ([[da]]) mandated specific [[rules]] for bus service for people with disabilities. [[unlike]] CAT already provided such service, it ensured that it conformed to the [[earlier]] ADA regulations. [[at]] 1999, CAT also operated the Penacook, Heights, [[broughton]] [[streets]] and senior service routes. Manchester Street service was funded through a three-year Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) [[plan]]. By 2005, CAT had started a Crosstown bus service between Airport Road and Concord Hospital. The Crosstown bus developed into the Industrial Park route that operates between Industrial Park Drive and the hospital today. CAT started year-round trolley service in 2008 when it received a three-year CMAQ grant. The matching funds for this grant were generously donated by Delta Dental. CAT currently provides fixed route transportation Monday-Friday from 6:00am to 6:30pm in Concord. CAT also provides demand-response transportation to seniors and people with disabilities.",0

"The Sheriff of Nottingham is the main villain of the 2006 BBC [[television]] series, Robin Hood. Keith Allen's portrayal was described by the Hollywood Reporter as \""very camp in the Alan Rickman tradition of sardonic villains,\"" referring to Rickman's role as the Sheriff in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Sarcastic and with a dark sense of humour, he has many catch phrases, including \""La di da di da!\"" and \""A clue: no\"" (also the title of the first season finale). He also has an explosive temper, usually triggered by Robin's interference or the repeated failures of Guy of Gisbourne and other minions. He has many insults for his servants when they fail him, including \""blithering oafs\"", \""incompetent fools\"" and \""idiotic buffoons\"". Vaisey became the Sheriff a few years before Robin's return to England, taking over from Marian's father Edward. He has used the position to become the leading figure in the 'Black Knights', a group conspiring to overthrow King Richard in favour of Prince John. As a plot device to explain why Robin does not kill the Sheriff, John insures the latter's life by promising to destroy Nottingham should he be killed. In \""Sisterhood,\"" the Sheriff's sister Davina is introduced, with whom he displays previously unseen affection. Davina dies in his arms after an altercation with Robin, for which the Sheriff vows revenge. Keith Allen lost one of his teeth while filming a fight sequence for the show. This was written into the script, with the Sheriff losing a tooth in the last episode of Series 1. He takes teeth from skulls and places them in the gap in his teeth as a recurring gag in the second series. In the third series, Prince John plays the Sheriff off against Gisbourne until in \""Do You Love Me?\"" they finally fight to the death and the Sheriff is killed by Gisbourne, or so Gisbourne thinks - it is shown at the end of the episode that the Sheriff survived; as his apparently dead body is carted away, his fingers twitch.

He is assisted by Blamire, Isabella's second-in-command, and it is later revealed that he has formed an alliance with Isabella. In a deadly confrontation with Robin and Gisborne, he ends up killing Gisborne. He is finally killed by a dying Robin (who has been poisoned by Isabella). who fires a burning arrow into the barrels of byzantine fire stored in the castle. Vaisey just has enough time to notice the barrels before the entire castle is blown up - and him, Isabella and their remaining men along with it.","The Sheriff of Nottingham is the main villain of the 2006 BBC [[tv]] series, Robin Hood. Keith Allen's portrayal was described by the Hollywood Reporter as \""very camp in the Alan Rickman tradition of sardonic villains,\"" referring to Rickman's role as the Sheriff in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Sarcastic and with a dark sense of humour, he has many catch phrases, including \""La di da di da!\"" and \""A clue: no\"" (also the title of the first season finale). He also has an explosive temper, usually triggered by Robin's interference or the repeated failures of Guy of Gisbourne and other minions. He has many insults for his servants when they fail him, including \""blithering oafs\"", \""incompetent fools\"" and \""idiotic buffoons\"". Vaisey became the Sheriff a few years before Robin's return to England, taking over from Marian's father Edward. He has used the position to become the leading figure in the 'Black Knights', a group conspiring to overthrow King Richard in favour of Prince John. As a plot device to explain why Robin does not kill the Sheriff, John insures the latter's life by promising to destroy Nottingham should he be killed. In \""Sisterhood,\"" the Sheriff's sister Davina is introduced, with whom he displays previously unseen affection. Davina dies in his arms after an altercation with Robin, for which the Sheriff vows revenge. Keith Allen lost one of his teeth while filming a fight sequence for the show.

"The Stockton and Darlington Railway  (S&DR) was a railway [[company]] that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863. The world's first public railway to use steam locomotives, its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington, and was officially opened on 27 September 1825. The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business, and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough. While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start, passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833. The S&DR was involved in the building of the East Coast Main Line between York and Darlington, but its main expansion was at Middlesbrough Docks and west into Weardale and east to Redcar. It suffered severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1840s and was nearly taken over by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, before the discovery of iron ore in Cleveland and the subsequent increase in revenue meant it could pay its debts. At the beginning of the 1860 it took over railways that had crossed the Pennines to join the West Coast Main Line at Tebay and Clifton, near Penrith. The company was taken over by the North Eastern Railway in 1863, transferring 200 route miles (320 route kilometres) of line and about 160 locomotives, but continued to operate independently as the Darlington Section until 1876. The opening of the S&DR was seen as proof of the effectiveness of steam railways and its anniversary was celebrated in 1875, 1925 and 1975. Much of the original route is now served by the Tees Valley Line, operated by Northern.","The Stockton and Darlington Railway  (S&DR) was a railway [[business]] that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863.

"Lost Dakotas was a Canadian alternative country [[band]] in the 1990s. The band originally consisted of vocalist Paul Dakota and bassist Greg McConnell (formerly of Absolute Whores), who began in 1989 as a busking duo at the corner of Yonge and Dundas Streets in Toronto. Dakota and McConnell added guitarist Adam Faux and drummer Ron Duffy for their 1990 debut, Love to Play. Initially released as a limited edition cassette, the album completely sold out in just two days. The band's visuals, including posters, album art and animated video clips, were created by artist Erella Vent. 1991's Last Train to Kipling (a reference to Kipling station on the Toronto Transit Commission's Bloor-Danforth subway line) stayed in the campus radio charts in Chart for over 100 weeks. The album was most noted for a countrified cover of AC/DC's \""Back in Black\"". In 1992 Faux left to focus work on his previous band Pig Farm, and was replaced by Rick O'Brien and later by Tim Bovaconte. The band supported the album with their first full-scale national tour in spring 1993. Their third and final album, Sun Machine, was released in 1993 on Cargo Records. The album included a cover of Ned Sublette's \""Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other\"", 13 years before the song was made famous by Willie Nelson. At the 1993 Kumbaya Festival, the band performed the song live with rock singer Lee Aaron as guest vocalist. For their 1994 tour to support that album, the band was also joined by J.C. Orr, formerly of King Apparatus, as a second guitarist. The band's final recording was a cover of Bob Snider's \""You\"" on the 1996 tribute album Poetreason: The Songs of Bob Snider. McConnell went on to form Stratochief, but died in 1999. Erella Vent, now Erella Ganon, continues as an illustrator and writer.

"After the Williams Omnibus Bus Line had become heavily loaded in 1861, the city of Toronto issued a transit franchise (Resolution 14, By-law 353) for a horse-drawn street railway.

"United States [[v]]. Cruikshank, 92 [[U]].[[S]]. 542 (1875) was an important United States Supreme [[Court]] decision in United States constitutional law, one of the earliest to [[deal]] with the application of the Bill of Rights to state [[governments]] following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case [[arose]] during the Reconstruction Era from the 1872 Louisiana [[gubernatorial]] [[election]] which was hotly disputed, and led to both [[major]] political parties certifying their slates of local officers. [[At]] Colfax, Louisiana, [[tensions]] climaxed in the Colfax massacre, in which 105 [[black]] [[people]] and 3 white people were killed. A federal [[judge]] ruled that the Republican-majority legislature be seated, but the [[Democrats]] did not [[accept]] this. [[Growing]] social tensions erupted on [[April]] [[13]], 1873, when an armed militia of white [[Democrats]] attacked black [[Republican]] freedmen, who had gathered at the Grant Parish [[Courthouse]] in [[Colfax]], Louisiana, to resist an attempt of Democratic [[takeover]] of the offices. Federal charges were brought against several [[members]] of the white insurgents under the Enforcement [[Act]] of 1870, which prohibited two or more [[people]] from conspiring to deprive anyone of their constitutional [[rights]]. [[Convictions]] were appealed to the Supreme Court. Among these [[charges]] including hindering the freedmen's First Amendment right to [[freely]] assemble and their Second Amendment right to keep and bear [[arms]]. In its [[ruling]], the Supreme Court overturned the convictions of the white men, [[holding]] that the Due Process Clause and the [[Equal]] [[Protection]] Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to state action, not to actions by individual citizens. It said that the plaintiffs had to rely on state courts for protection, although at the [[time]] and for decades after these courts never convicted white men for [[murder]] of [[blacks]].The Justices ruled that the Second Amendment only [[restricts]] the power of the national government in taking away rights and that the right to \""keep and bear arms for a lawful purpose\"" exists apart from the Constitution, not because of it, stating \""This is not a right granted by the Constitution.
