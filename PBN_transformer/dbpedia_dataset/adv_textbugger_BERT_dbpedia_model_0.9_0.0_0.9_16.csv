"\""Space Invaders\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979. The song is based on the hugely successful 1978 video game Space Invaders. It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and ending up as the fourth best selling single in Australia for 1980. The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984). Dunlop and Brown also released an album as Player One, Game Over. Dunlop recalled: \""We sat down and wrote a bunch of space songs, but instead of sticking to the concept of the hit, we wandered off into the 'clever' musical genre with fancy time signatures, radical chord progressions and so on. The reply came back for the States that this was intended for 13- to 14-year-olds: 'You've lost us.'\"" The single and album were released in the US under the band name Playback, which Brown and Dunlop had used for other projects, to avoid confusion with the US band Player.

It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and ending up as the fourth best selling single in Australia for 1980. The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984). Dunlop and Brown also released an album as Player One, Game Over. Dunlop recalled: \""We sat down and wrote a bunch of space songs, but instead of sticking to the concept of the hit, we wandered off into the 'clever' musical genre with fancy time signatures, radical chord progressions and so on. The reply came back for the States that this was intended for 13- to 14-year-olds: 'You've lost us.'\"" The single and album were released in the US under the band name Playback, which Brown and Dunlop had used for other projects, to avoid confusion with the US band Player. The US version of the album was titled Space Invaders.",1

"[[Our]] [[Boys]] was a boys' [[magazine]] [[published]] monthly by the Irish Christian Brothers in Ireland. The various Education Acts of the late 19th and early 20th century had created a market in Britain for magazines and periodicals which were also popular in Ireland. At a time when there was a growing sense of national self-identity in Ireland, the purpose of the Our Boys magazine was to compete with British boys' magazines, which were in the main pro-British Empire and pro-Church of England. It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. It was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie.

The various Education Acts of the late 19th and early 20th century had created a market in Britain for magazines and periodicals which were also popular in Ireland. At a time when there was a growing sense of national self-identity in Ireland, the purpose of the Our Boys magazine was to compete with British boys' magazines, which were in the main pro-British Empire and pro-Church of England. It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. It was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage [[band]], they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. [[Formed]] in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). [[The]] band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the [[band]] recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic [[proto-heavy]] metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double [[guitar]] instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli.

Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, [[Akarma]] Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an [[audiophile]] remaster of this underground classic\"".

"William [[Harold]] Lee (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century [[movie]] theater [[designer]] and later the [[chief]] [[architect]] for Eastern [[College]]. He was a prot√©g√© of [[acclaimed]] [[Philadelphia]] architect Frank [[Furness]]. [[Lee]] attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he [[studied]] architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg.

"[[The]] black-lored babbler or Sharpe's pied-babbler (Turdoides [[sharpei]]) is a [[species]] of bird in the [[Leiothrichidae]] family. It is found in southwestern Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and the part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo immediately adjacent to the three [[last-named]] countries. This bird was formerly considered the same species as Turdoides [[melanops]] of southern Africa, now known as the black-faced babbler. These birds are mostly grey-brown with white mottling, especially on the underparts, that varies according to location and the individual. The population near Nanyuki, Kenya, is darker but can have a pure white chin or entire throat.

First published in 1865, the newspaper is published every Tuesday and Friday, at the retail price of 50p. Many of its reporters have gone on to make careers in Fleet Street, and it is still considered a training ground for the nationals. Max Wall and then Richard Woolveridge edited the bi-weekly in its glory days when its circulation was over 130,000. The novelist Martyn Bedford used to work in the Lewisham office of the paper, while Brian Alexander, the former sports editor of The Sun and Mail on Sunday, was sports editor until 1986. Paul McCarthy, sports editor of the News of the World, John Pienaar, political correspondent and reporter on BBC Radio 5 Live and David Bond, who was appointed as the BBC's Sports Editor in 2010, worked at the SLP in the 1980s and 1990s.

Max Wall and then Richard Woolveridge edited the bi-weekly in its glory days when its circulation was over 130,000. The novelist Martyn Bedford used to work in the Lewisham office of the paper, while Brian Alexander, the former sports editor of The Sun and Mail on Sunday, was sports editor until 1986. Paul McCarthy, sports editor of the News of the World, John Pienaar, political correspondent and reporter on BBC Radio 5 Live and David Bond, who was appointed as the BBC's Sports Editor in 2010, worked at the SLP in the 1980s and 1990s. Others who went on to Fleet Street include Brian McConnell, Peter Burden, Ron Ricketts, Geoff Manners, John Rodda and Colin Wood. The South London Press won the Press Gazette Regional Press Awards 2009 Newspaper of the Year for weekly newspapers above 20,000 circulation. The current editor of the South London Press is Hannah Walker. The SLP incorporates former newspapers, South London News and South London Observer, and the South London Advertiser Group. The newspaper is part of the Tindle Group, which bought it from Trinity Mirror in 2007. It has previously sponsored Millwall F.C.

"Girl Germs was a zine created by University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, both members of the band Bratmobile. Feminism was influential in the Pacific Northwest in the early nineties: Girl Germs heralded an explosion of zines that accompanied the rebirth of feminism. These zines included Ms America,Satan Wears A Bra, Fantastic Fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter and others. Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school.

"(For their \""best of\"" album, see The Best of Judas Priest: Living After Midnight.) \""Living After Midnight\"" is a [[song]] by British heavy metal band Judas Priest.

On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing.

On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks.

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss.

"[[Weyerbacher]] [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], Pennsylvania, [[United]] States, founded in [[1995]] by Dan and [[Sue]] Weirback.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon.

"Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the [[sac]] fungi or ascomycetes. They are the [[largest]] phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a [[microscopic]] sexual structure in which nonmotile [[spores]], called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously [[placed]] in the Deuteromycota [[along]] with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now [[identified]] and [[classified]] based on morphological or physiological similarities to [[ascus-bearing]] [[taxa]], and by [[phylogenetic]] [[analyses]] of DNA sequences.

"\""Nobody Does It Better\"" is a [[song]] composed by Marvin Hamlisch with lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager. It was recorded by Carly Simon as the theme song for the 1977 James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me. It was the first Bond theme song to be titled differently from the name of the film since Dr. No, although the phrase \""the spy who loved me\"" is included in the lyrics. The song was released as a single from the film's soundtrack album. \""Nobody Does It Better\"" became a major wordwide hit, spending three weeks at #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart. It also reached #7 on the UK Singles Chart. The [[song]] was certified Gold by the RIAA, signifying sales of one million copies in the US. The song is Simon's longest-charting hit. Her earlier hit \""You're So Vain\"" spent three weeks at #1; however, its chart run was two months shorter than that of \""Nobody Does It Better.\"" The title of the theme was later used for Simon's 1999 greatest hits compilation, The Very Best of Carly Simon: Nobody Does It Better. Among the most successful Bond theme songs, \""Nobody Does It Better\"" received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song where it lost to \""You Light Up My Life\"", as well as a Golden Globe Award nomination. At the 20th Annual Grammy Awards held in 1978, \""Nobody Does It Better\"" received a nomination for Song of the Year and Simon was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.

The Waitaki flows through Lake Benmore, Lake [[Aviemore]] and Lake Waitaki, these lakes being contained by hydroelectric dams, Benmore Dam, Aviemore Dam and Waitaki Dam. The Waitaki has several tributaries, notably the Ahuriri River and the [[Hakataramea]] River. It passes Kurow and [[Glenavy]] before entering the Pacific Ocean. The river‚Äôs flow is normally low in winter, with flows increasing in spring when the snow cloaking the Southern Alps begins to melt, with flows throughout the summer being rainfall dependent and then declining in the autumn as the colder weather begins to freeze the smaller streams and streams which feed the catchment.

"The [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a natural landslide [[dam]] [[along]] the Murghab River in [[Tajikistan]]. At [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the [[tallest]] dam in the [[world]], either natural or [[man-made]]. The dam was [[created]] on February 18, [[1911]], when the [[7]].[[4-Ms]] Sarez earthquake [[caused]] a [[massive]] landslide that blocked the flow of the [[river]]. The [[dam]] is formed of [[approximately]] 2 [[cubic]] kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of [[rock]] dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the [[Murghab]], which cuts from east to [[west]] through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely [[buried]] by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 [[metres]] (1,600 to 2,300 [[ft]]) from the original [[valley]] [[floor]]. The [[basin]] formed by Usoi Dam now holds [[Sarez]] [[Lake]], a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 [[mi]])-[[long]] [[lake]] holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre¬∑ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the dam, which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which [[approximately]] matches the rate of [[inflow]], maintaining the [[lake]] at a relatively constant [[level]]. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the [[Usoi]] Dam [[may]] become unstable during [[future]] large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or [[subsequent]] landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. The Murghab's river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep.

He sings that this is \""magic\"" and presents the scenario as a perfect way to be with his lover. In contrast to the fast tempo songs beginning to dominate the Contest by this point, the song is quite laid-back with an acoustic guitar (first introduced immediately after Faniello sings \""A guitar in my hand\"") providing a melodic counterpoint. The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following Estonia's Tanel Padar and Dave Benton with \""Everybody\"" and preceding Greece's Antique with \""Die For You\"". At the close of voting, it had received 48 points, placing 9th in a field of 23.

He sings that this is \""magic\"" and presents the scenario as a perfect way to be with his lover. In contrast to the fast tempo songs beginning to dominate the Contest by this point, the song is quite laid-back with an acoustic guitar (first introduced immediately after Faniello sings \""A guitar in my hand\"") providing a melodic counterpoint. The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following Estonia's Tanel Padar and Dave Benton with \""Everybody\"" and preceding Greece's Antique with \""Die For You\"".

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010‚Äì11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020.

It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place.

"The Raving Loony Green Giant [[Party]] was a [[political]] [[party]] in the [[United]] Kingdom. It was founded in 1989 by former members of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party (OMRLP) after clashes between them and other members of the party over direction and party activities ‚Äì in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the OMRLP ‚Äì the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: [[Fornebubanen]]) is a proposed rail [[line]] which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in [[B√¶rum]], [[Norway]].

"[[Str√°nsk√°]] [[sk√°la]] (often without diacritics as [[Stranska]] skala) is a [[hill]] and refers to a Mid-Pleistocene-Cromerian [[interglacial]] most important [[paleontological]] site in Central [[Europe]]. It is situated in the eastern part of Brno, Moravia near the city districts ≈Ωidenice/Juli√°nov and Slatina, [[dating]] to [[approximately]] [[600]],000 BP, as supported by paleomagnetic dating. It is a 1500 m long and 400 m wide [[hill]], built from [[Jurassic]] limestone, especially Callovian-Oxfordian, [[built]] from light brown [[Caleidocrinus]] (Crinoid) mostly and Brachiopoddes and Coral and more other types of limestones rich of fossil fauna as well. Str√°nsk√° sk√°la [[hill]] is [[located]] in Bohemian [[Massif]] (and right on the border between the [[two]] [[geological]] provinces): Bohemian Massif (Moravian Karst) and Carpates (Western [[Subcarpathia-]] [[Dyje-Svratka]] Vale). Its northwestern [[slope]] is composed from karstified limestone cliffs in which numerous fossiliferous fissures and caves were found. [[Approximately]] 48 meter of this [[slope]] are [[covered]] by complex talus fan. At this place extensive [[excavations]] were made by [[paleonthologist]] Rudolf Musil and his colleagues in 1956-1968 which yielded rich [[paleothological]] material, including Homotherium [[moravicum]] teeth and [[approximately]] 1600 bones and bone fragments of birds from 23 families, 51 genera and 68 species. Earlier (1943) were Ursus deningeri discovered, an later rich spectrum of [[coastal]] animal fossils such as ostracods, bivalves and fishes.

It is situated in the eastern part of Brno, Moravia near the city districts ≈Ωidenice/Juli√°nov and Slatina, [[daùöùing]] to [[a—Äproximately]] [[60]],000 BP, as supported by paleomagnetic dating. It is a 1500 m long and 400 m wide [[h—ñll]], built from [[Jurassiœ≤]] limestone, especially Callovian-Oxfordian, [[builùöù]] from light brown [[Caledocrinus]] (Crinoid) mostly and Brachiopoddes and Coral and more other types of limestones rich of fossil fauna as well.

Its northwestern [[s‚Öºope]] is composed from karstified limestone cliffs in which numerous fossiliferous fissures and caves were found. [[Approxim…ëtely]] 48 meter of this [[s‚Öºope]] are [[covere‘Å]] by complex talus fan. At this place extensive [[excavation—ï]] were made by [[paleonthoogist]] Rudolf Musil and his colleagues in 1956-1968 which yielded rich [[paleotholo]] [[gical]] material, including Homotherium [[moavicum]] teeth and [[approximatel—É]] 1600 bones and bone fragments of birds from 23 families, 51 genera and 68 species.
