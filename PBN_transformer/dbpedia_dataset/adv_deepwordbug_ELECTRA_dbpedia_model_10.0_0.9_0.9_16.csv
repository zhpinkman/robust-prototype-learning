"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

[[She]] is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent ([[白蛇のナガー]] Sāpento no Nāga) is a fictional [[charactZr]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan.

In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team. During the 2000–2001 season the team hosted the ECHL All-Star game at Alltel Arena. Head coach Jeff Ward. Assistant coach Brad Gratton. In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central Hockey League team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down. In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–2004 season but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely. In July 2009, Alltel Arena officially became Verizon Arena after Verizon Wireless, Inc. purchased Alltel Corp.",0

The [[story]] focuses on the character, [[Masafumi]] [[Tamura]], a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, [[Lackawanna]] & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The [[Cut-Off]] ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the [[Lackawanna]] Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much [[gentler]] ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The [[Cut-Off]] also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the [[line]] were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the [[roadbed]] required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. [[Operated]] through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cut-Off]] remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie [[Lackawanna]] Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. [[Conrail]] ceased operation of the [[Cut-Off]] in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

"[[Elisaeus]] Adougan was a late 14th century and early 15th century Scottish [[cleric]]. His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390, but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish [[church]] of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ...

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of [[Fame]] [[Thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] [[whose]] [[1878]] match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the [[horse]] became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the [[three-year-old]] Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard [[IV's]] future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky.
