"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The [[match]] is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The [[mtach]] is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.",5

Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard [[garage]] band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"[[William]] [[Harold]] [[Lee]] ([[December]] [[9]], 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the [[chief]] architect for [[Eastern]] [[College]]. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he [[studied]] architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia. Lee used Art Deco elements in combination with traditional building detailing. \n* Lansdowne Theatre \n* Sedgwick Theatre \n* The Seville Theater, now known as the Bryn Mawr Film Institute",0

The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

"The Jerusalem Light [[Rail]] (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail system in Jerusalem. Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011.

Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ₪3.8 billion (approx.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel [[band]], likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [[Their]] debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"Hugo Lafayette Black ([[February]] [[27]], [[1886]] – [[September]] 25, 1971) was an [[American]] [[politician]] who served as a Democratic United States Senator and [[represented]] Alabama in the [[Senate]] from 1927 to 1937, and served as an [[Associate]] [[Justice]] of the Supreme [[Court]] of the United States from [[1937]] to 1971.

It opened to the public in 1991, and today consists of three [[roomѕ]] containing a large collection of anatomical oddities and dissections, most of which date from the 19th and [[earⅼy]] [[20𝚝h]] centuries. In addition to animal skeletons and dissections, such as a piglet displayed in cross-section, the [[museuｍ]] contains a [[ѕubstantial]] collection of monstrosities ([[terɑtology]]) including Siamese twin lambs, a two-headed calf, a [[10]] -[[legged]] sheep, and a colt with one [[hue]] eye. The museum's most astonishing items are the famous \""écorchés\"" ([[flaeyd]] figures) [[prepareԁ]] by Honoré Fragonard, the school's first [[professoⲅ]] of anatomy, appointed in 1766 and in 1771 dismissed from the school as a [[madｍan]].

"[[Elisaeus]] Adougan was a late [[14th]] [[century]] and [[early]] [[15th]] [[century]] [[Scottish]] [[cleric]]. His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter [[datable]] to 25 November [[1390]], but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years.

"Laurie [[Fowler]] ([[born]] [[29]] [[December]] 1951) is a former [[Australian]] [[rules]] [[footballer]] who [[played]] for [[Richmond]] and [[Melbourne]] in the [[Victorian]] [[Football]] League (VFL). [[After]] [[finishing]] runner-up in the [[senior]] [[best]] and fairest [[count]] as a 16-year-old at Oakleigh Districts, [[Fowler]] was zoned to [[Richmond]]. [[Working]] his way up from the [[thirds]] side, [[Fowler]] [[made]] his [[senior]] VFL [[debut]] in [[1971]] and [[soon]] [[became]] recognised as a [[tough]] and [[courageous]] [[defender]]. He will be [[best]] [[remembered]] as the [[player]] who [[crashed]] into [[Carlton]] captain-coach John [[Nicholls]] at the start of the 1973 VFL Grand [[Final]]. The collision severely impacted Nicholls and helped Richmond avenge their loss to Carlton in the previous year's Grand Final. Richmond won the [[premiership]] again in [[1974]], but Fowler quit after he was omitted from the team. The Tigers [[considered]] Fowler's [[senior]] options to be [[limited]] and [[sold]] him to [[Melbourne]], the [[club]] [[Fowler]] had [[supported]] as a [[child]], for $[[15]],000 ([[equivalent]] to over $100,000 in [[2009]]). [[Fowler]] [[made]] an [[instant]] impact with the struggling [[Demons]], [[winning]] the [[Keith]] '[[Bluey']] [[Truscott]] [[Medal]] for the best and fairest [[player]] at the [[club]] in his [[first]] season. Although [[primarily]] a [[back-pocket]] [[player]], [[Melbourne]] coach Bob Skilton [[also]] [[used]] [[Fowler]] as a ruck-rover to help [[cover]] for [[Greg]] Wells' [[lack]] of [[defensive]] [[skills]] in the [[midfield]]. In [[1976]], Melbourne [[narrowly]] missed out on the [[finals]] after Carlton drew with Footscray in the final [[round]] of the home-and-away [[season]]. [[Fowler]] was again [[among]] Melbourne's [[best]] [[players]], [[finishing]] [[runner-up]] to [[Wells]] in the [[Keith]] Truscott Medal [[count]]. Skilton was replaced as coach by [[former]] [[premiership]] [[player]] Dennis Jones at the [[end]] of the [[1977]] [[VFL]] season, but Melbourne's [[fortunes]] did not improve and they finished last in [[1978]]. [[During]] that season, [[Fowler]] had to be [[talked]] out of [[retirement]] after being relegated to the [[Reserves]], and then [[quit]] for a [[brief]] [[time]] in May after being substituted against North [[Melbourne]]. Despite [[receiving]] offers from a number of top [[clubs]] at the [[time]], [[Fowler]] [[returned]] to [[Melbourne]] just days [[later]] and [[reconciled]]. [[Jones]] was sacked at the end of the season and Carl Ditterich returned as captain-coach. [[Although]] Melbourne did not [[fare]] [[much]] better under [[Ditterich]], Fowler continued to stand out, winning [[successive]] Keith Truscott [[Medals]] in 1979 and [[1980]] and [[representing]] Victoria at [[interstate]] level in [[1980]] and [[1981]]. [[Fowler]] walked out on Melbourne after [[contract]] [[negotiations]] failed before the start of the 1982 VFL season.

"Mosh n' [[Roll]] is the [[sixth]] studio [[album]] from metalcore [[band]] Bury Your Dead. Most notably, the [[album]] marks the return of the band's former vocalist, [[Mat]] [[Bruso]].

"The Irish [[Independence]] [[Party]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in [[Northern]] Ireland, [[founded]] in October [[1977]] by [[Frank]] [[McManus]] (former Unity MP for [[Fermanagh]] & South Tyrone between [[1970]] and 1974) and Fergus [[McAteer]] (son of Eddie [[McAteer]], who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and [[1969]]). The party was [[effectively]] a [[merger]] of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the [[bulk]] of activists and councillors from the two [[movements]] joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. [[It]] was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party ([[SDLP]]) councillor, [[John]] Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in [[1980]] in [[Carnlough]], County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence [[Association]]. [[The]] [[party]] first [[came]] to prominence by [[standing]] four candidates in the [[1979]] UK [[general]] election. Its [[best]] result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick [[Fahy]] captured [[12]],055 [[votes]] (19%), [[however]] the main effect was to [[split]] the Nationalist vote and [[prevent]] the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP [[continued]] to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the [[blanket]]\"" and [[later]] hunger strike. The [[IIP]] won 21 [[seats]] on councils in the local [[elections]] of 1981 as a result of its [[involvement]] with the campaign, [[although]] this [[support]] was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just [[four]] [[councils]]: Fermanagh, Derry, [[Omagh]] and Newry & Mourne. [[However]], for a [[short]] period of time it [[came]] to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a [[number]] of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist [[Party]] securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the [[Assembly]] elections in October [[1982]], [[leaving]] the field clear for [[Sinn]] Féin, who began [[standing]] candidates in [[elections]] in the [[early]] [[1980s]]. As a [[result]], the IIP lost [[republican]] support, for [[example]] in the [[first]] [[by-election]] in which Sinn Féin [[stood]], in Omagh in 1983, the [[IIP]] were only able to poll [[5]]% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took [[60]]%.

"Ah Pook Is Here was a collaboration between author William S. Burroughs and artist [[Malcolm]] Mc Neill. [[It]] began in [[1970]], when Burroughs was living in [[London]] and Mc [[Neill]] was in his [[final]] year of [[art]] school. It [[first]] [[appeared]] under the title The [[Unspeakable]] [[Mr]]. [[Hart]] as a [[comic]] [[strip]] in the English Cyclops. When that [[magazine]] [[ceased]] [[publication]], [[Burroughs]] and [[Mc]] Neill [[decided]] to develop the concept as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 [[pages]] to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in [[reference]] to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco agreed to [[publish]] the proposed work in 1971 as a \""Word/Image [[novel]]\"" which was to comprise 120 [[pages]], some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. However, the small [[advance]] proffered by the publisher [[made]] any more than a few months of working [[full-time]] on the project [[impossible]], and when Straight Arrow closed in 1974 the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, Mc Neill moved to New York in 1975 to rejoin Burroughs and continue the work. They were unable to find another publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was subsequently [[published]] in 1979 (by John Calder and Viking Penguin) in text form only under the original title of Ah Pook Is Here. [[After]] 30 years the [[original]] visual works were resurrected and restored by Mc Neill for a West [[Coast]] showing at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, CA, April 4th to [[May]] 2nd, 2009 and a [[December]] 2008 showing in [[New]] York at Saloman Arts [[Gallery]].

"The Vancouver [[Dragons]] were a [[professional]] [[basketball]] team in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams.

"(In this [[name]], the family [[name]] is [[Law]], not Bonar [[Law]].) [[Andrew]] [[Bonar]] [[Law]] ([[16]] [[September]] [[1858]] – [[30]] [[October]] [[1923]]), [[commonly]] called Bonar [[Law]] (), was a [[British]] [[Conservative]] [[Party]] [[statesman]] and [[Prime]] Minister. [[Born]] in the [[colony]] of [[New]] [[Brunswick]] (now in [[Canada]]), he is the only [[British]] [[Prime]] [[Minister]] to have been [[born]] [[outside]] the British [[Isles]]. [[Law]] was of Scottish and Ulster Scots [[descent]], and having [[moved]] [[back]] to Scotland in [[1870]], he [[left]] [[school]] aged sixteen to [[work]] in the iron industry, becoming a wealthy man by the [[age]] of thirty. He entered Parliament at the [[1900]] [[general]] election, relatively [[late]] in life for a front-rank [[politician]], and was [[made]] a junior minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, in [[1902]]. Law [[joined]] the Shadow [[Cabinet]] in opposition after the [[1906]] [[election]]. In [[1911]] he was [[appointed]] a Privy Councillor, and stood for the vacant party leadership. [[Despite]] never having served in the [[Cabinet]], and despite trailing [[third]] after Walter [[Long]] and [[Austen]] Chamberlain, [[Law]] became leader when the two frontrunners withdrew [[rather]] than risk a draw splitting the [[party]]. As Leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition, Law [[focused]] his attentions in [[favour]] of tariff reform and against Irish Home Rule. [[His]] campaigning [[helped]] turn Liberal attempts to [[pass]] the Third Home Rule Bill into a [[three-year]] [[struggle]] eventually halted by the start of the First World War, with much argument over the status of the six [[predominantly]] Protestant counties which would [[later]] become Northern Ireland. [[Law]] [[first]] [[held]] Cabinet office as Secretary of State for the [[Colonies]] in Asquith's Coalition Government (May [[1915-December]] 1916). On Asquith's fall from power he declined to [[form]] a government, instead serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer in [[Lloyd]] [[George's]] Coalition [[Government]]. He resigned on grounds of [[ill-health]] early in [[1921]]. In October [[1922]], with [[Lloyd]] George's [[Coalition]] having become unpopular with Conservatives, he [[wrote]] an anonymous letter to the [[press]] giving only lukewarm support to the [[Government's]] actions over Chanak. After Conservative MPs voted to end the [[Coalition]], he again became Party Leader and, this time, Prime Minister. In November he won a clear majority at the [[1922]] [[general]] election. His brief premiership saw negotiation with the USA over Britain's war loans. Seriously ill with throat cancer, Law resigned in May 1923 and died later that year.

"For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region.

Although not the most southerly point of South America (which are the Diego Ramírez Islands), Cape Horn [[marks]] the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans collide. For [[decades]] it was a major milestone on the clipper [[route]], by which sailing [[ships]] carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and [[Icebergs]]; these dangers have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard. The need for ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape.
