AIA [[traces]] its [[roots]] back to 1919 when an [[enterprising]] [[young]] [[man]] [[named]] [[Cornelius]] Vander [[Starr]] [[opened]] an insurance [[agency]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. Vander [[Starr]] [[eventually]] [[expanded]] his [[business]] throughout [[Asia]], the US, and [[worldwide]]. [[In]] 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American [[International]] [[Group]] (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, [[raising]] approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 [[billion]]), the world's [[third]] largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA [[agreed]] to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest [[financial]] conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings.

"[[Oleg]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[born]] 10 [[January]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] [[chess]] grandmaster and former European [[junior]] [[champion]].

In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, [[Pennsylvania]], [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

"The [[Word]] is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup [[includes]] well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel [[bands]], with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that [[often]] accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally [[developed]] from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional [[exclamations]] of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.
