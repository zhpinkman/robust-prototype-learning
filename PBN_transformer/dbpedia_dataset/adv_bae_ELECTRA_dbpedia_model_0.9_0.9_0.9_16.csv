"Balaji Baji Rao (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), also known as Nana Saheb, was a Peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire in India. During his tenure, the [[Chhatrapati]] (Maratha king) was reduced to a mere figurehead. At the same time, the Maratha empire started transforming into a confederacy, in which individual chiefs — such as the Holkars, the Scindias and the Bhonsles of Nagpur — became more powerful. During Balaji Rao's tenure, the Maratha territory reached its zenith. A large part of this expansion, however, was led by the individual chiefs, whose acts of plundering alienated the masses. By the end of Balaji Rao's tenure, the Peshwa was reduced to more of a financier than a general. Unlike his father, Balaji Rao was not a great military leader, and failed to gauge the seriousness of Durrani invasions in northern India. This ultimately resulted in a massive Maratha defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat. Some judicial and revenue reforms were made during his tenure, but the credit for these goes to his cousin Sadashivrao Bhau and his associate Balshastri Gadgil.","Balaji Baji Rao (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), also known as Nana Saheb, was a Peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha Empire in India.

"Court Martial (foaled 1942 in England – died in 1974) was a Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] bred and raced by Lord Astor best known for defeating two exceptional colts in Dante and Royal Charger for the Classic 2000 Guineas Stakes and as a two-time leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland. He was a chestnut horse sired by the leading sire Fair Trial, that also sired Petition (won the Eclipse Stakes). Court Martial’s dam Instantaneous by Hurry On was the dam of several other named foals, but none was a stakes winner. She was a great granddaughter of Astor's foundation mare Conjure. John Hislop describes Court Martial as \""A beautiful horse of superb quality, truly made, sound and possessed of excellent limbs, but with shelly feet a trait which he has handed on ...

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived [[Women's]] Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

The mission of Constant Peg was to train Air Force, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps pilots and weapon systems officers, in air combat tactics against these foreign aircraft and was instrumental in the re-development of Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) methods developed after the end of the Vietnam War. Today's USAF [[gunnery]] training squadrons can symbolically trace their histories back to the [[former]], as well as the paint motifs on their aircraft, which were used by the aircraft of the squadron in the 1970s and 1980s.",0

"Asia are a British progressive rock [[band]]. The band was formed in 1981 as a supergroup of four members from different progressive rock bands: John Wetton (former bassist/vocalist of bands including King Crimson, Family, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep, UK and Wishbone Ash), Steve Howe (guitarist of Yes), Geoff Downes (keyboardist of Yes and The Buggles) and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Atomic Rooster). With their debut album Asia from 1982 reaching No. 1 in several countries, Asia ranks as one of the most popular progressive rock bands in history.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel [[Live]]! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live [[concerts]], there is [[typically]] only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[construction]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"Cagliostro-Walzer [[op]].370 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February [[1875]] at the famous Theater an der Wien. [[The]] waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' [[ich]] [[mit]] Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben\"" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta. [[The]] operetta itself was a success at its first [[performance]] and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera composers to draft melodies from their successful [[stage]] works to be arranged as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'. [[The]] entire waltz [[consists]] of just 3 two-part waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the [[previous]] 5 two-part [[sections]] heard in his earlier works. The [[piece]] began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. [[The]] principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody [[starts]] off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C [[major]] as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief coda enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated.

"Shore [[Line]] East (SLE) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut, US. A fully owned subsidiary of the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT), SLE provides service seven days a week along the Northeast Corridor from New London west to New Haven, with limited through service to Bridgeport and Stamford. Connecting service west of New Haven to New York City is available via Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. The service was introduced in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.","Shore [[lines]] East (SLE) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut, US.

"The Arab Socialist Ba'ath [[Party]] – Region of Sudan (Arabic: [[حزب]] البعث العربي الاشتراكي - وطن في السودان Hizb Al-Ba'ath Al-Arabi Al-Ishtiraki - Watan fi [[Al-Sudan]]), previously known as the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Country of Sudan, is a political [[party]] in Sudan. The party is the Sudanese regional branch of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party in Sudan. While the branch has always been small, accounting for an estimated 1,000 members in 2003, it has been able to have a bigger impact than what its meager membership numbers would suggest, mostly due to Iraqi financing of the branch. After collaborating with the Arab nationalist Sudanese government for years, the Ba'ath Party broke off relations and became an opposition party in 1990; this would have disturbed Iraq if Sudan had not supported it during the 1991 Gulf crisis. In 1990, the party was composed largely of students who had studied in Ba'athist Iraq. The party, which was small in 1990, was influential in certain sectors, and was opposed to the National Islamic Front and was staunchly secularist. Members have historically been torn between the Ba'ath and other secular party movements, such as the Sudanese Communist Party. Because of Saddam Hussein's amicable relationship with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation, the body ruling Sudan, the Ba'ath branch was oppressed by the authorities. Later in 1990, 26 Ba'athi military officers were executed in Khartoum after a failed military coup. In 2002, a group led by Mohamad Ali Jadein broke away from the branch and established the independent Sudanese Ba'ath Party, which has no affiliation with either the Iraqi or the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party.

"[[State]] Route 410 (SR 410, partially named the Chinook Scenic Byway, and also [[named]] the Stephen Mather Memorial Parkway) is a 107.44-mile (172.91 km) long state [[highway]] that traverses Pierce, King, and Yakima counties in the US state of Washington. It begins at an [[interchange]] with SR 167 in Sumner and travels southeast across the Cascade Range to a junction with U.S. Route 12 (US 12) in Naches. While the western part of SR 410 is a freeway that serves built-up, urban areas, the remainder of the route is a surface road that traverses mostly rural areas as it passes through the mountains. The route starts as a limited-access southerly bypass of Downtown Sumner, but becomes a surface road east of the city. Traveling eastward, the roadway serves Bonney Lake and Buckley, and crosses and eventually parallels the White River into Enumclaw and Greenwater. SR 410 enters the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and later heads into Mount Rainier National Park, crossing the Cayuse and Chinook passes, and leaves the park southeast along the American River into Wenatchee National Forest.

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. [[Their]] Passio contains all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at Marsica. The earliest source on their life actually dates from a Passio of 1406. The Passio states that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons Constantius and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to [[visit]] the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards [[prohibited]] this. However, God liberated them from their chains, [[allowing]] them to [[make]] the pilgrimage to the tombs with a [[group]] of Christians. The pilgrimage [[resulted]] in a fight [[erupting]] between the Christians and [[pagans]]; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae. After the death of the three saints, an earthquake shook the town and one of the executioners was converted to Christianity, with the deacon named Florentius, a witness to the event, writing down and passing down the news of their deaths.","Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century.

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] [[whose]] 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky.

"\""Peter Pan\"" is a song co-written and recorded by American country pop artist Kelsea Ballerini for her debut studio album, The First Time (2015). Ballerini co-wrote the song with Forest Glen Whitehead and Jesse Lee. It was released to American country radio on March 21, 2016 as the album's third single. The song is a country pop ballad about a lost love being compared to the song's namesake as a metaphor for being immature and having a tendency to run off to his own fantasy. \""Peter Pan\"" peaked at number one on both the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, becoming Ballerini's first to hit the [[top]] of the [[former]], and her third consecutive on the latter [[chart]].

"The [[Church]] of St. Mary of the Priory (Italian: Chiesa di Santa Maria del Priorato), can also be known by its previous name of St. Mary on the Aventine (Italian: Santa Maria in Aventino). It is the monastery church of the Priory of the Knights of Malta on the Aventine Hill in Rome, and is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The original church was built in 939, when Odo of Cluny was given the Roman palace of Alberic II of Spoleto, which was then converted into a Cluniac Benedictine monastery. When the monastery was dissolved in the 14th-century, the site was acquired by the Knights of Malta, and, under them, the church was rebuilt in the 1550s. In 1760, the papal nephew and Grand Prior of the Knights, Cardinal Giambattista Rezzonico, sought to [[improve]] the appearance of the buildings. On a limited budget, the church was substantially [[renovated]] between 1764-66 according to the designs of [[Giovanni]] [[Battista]] Piranesi, who also built the piazza in front of the church, the Piazza dei Cavaliere di Malta.

"The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland and, formerly, in Germany) or [[ICE]] (German pronunciation: [iːtseːˈʔeː]) is a system of high-speed [[trains]] predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service category offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam. On 10 June 2007, a new line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart was opened, jointly operated by ICE and TGV trains. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are planned for 2018. While ICE 3M trains operate the Paris-Frankfurt service (with the exception of trains 9553/9552, which operate with TGV Duplex equipment and are cross-crewed with both SNCF and DB staff), SNCF's TGV runs from Paris to Munich (via Stuttgart), with mixed crews on both trains. German and Austrian ICE T trains run to Vienna. On 9 December 2007, the ICE TD was introduced on the service from Berlin via Hamburg to the Danish cities of Aarhus and Copenhagen. The Spanish railway operator RENFE also employs trains based on the ICE 3 (Siemens Velaro) called AVE Class 103 which are certified to run at speeds up to 350 km/h. Wider versions were ordered by China for the Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Railway link (CRH 3) and by Russia for the Moscow – Saint Petersburg and Moscow – Nizhny Novgorod routes (Velaro RUS).","The Intercity-Express (written as InterCityExpress in Austria, Denmark, Switzerland and, formerly, in Germany) or [[icy]] (German pronunciation: [iːtseːˈʔeː]) is a system of high-speed [[railway]] predominantly running in Germany and its surrounding countries. It is the highest service category offered by DB Fernverkehr and is the flagship of Deutsche Bahn. The brand name \""ICE\"" is among the best-known in Germany, with a brand awareness close to 100%, according to DB. There are currently 259 trainsets in five different versions of the ICE vehicles in use, named ICE 1 (deployed in 1991), ICE 2 (1996), ICE T (1999), ICE 3 (1999) and ICE TD (2001–2003, back in service 2007). The ICE 3, including its variant models, is made by a consortium led by Bombardier and Siemens. Procurement of a further version, ICx, began c.2008, and was rebranded ICE 4 in late 2015. Introduction of the trains are expected from 2016 onwards. Apart from domestic use, the trains can also be seen in countries neighbouring Germany. There are, for example, ICE 1 lines to Basel and Zurich. ICE 3 trains also run to Liège and Brussels and at lower speeds to Amsterdam.

The brother monks asked him the reason for his joy to which he replied, 'I have just seen the angels, and they showed me a page with all my many sins. I said to them: \""The Lord said: 'Judge not, that ye be not judged.' I have never judged anyone and I hope in the mercy of God, that He will not judge me.\"" And the angels tore up the sheet of paper.' Hearing this, the monks wondered at it and learned from it.\"" (From the Prologue) The commemoration of the Uncondemning Monk is celebrated on 30 March in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Catholic Churches. (See St. John Climacus who is also commemorated on 30 March.)",0

"Nagana [[szlachectwa]] (Latin: Vituperatio nobilitatis), literally reprobation/reprimand/censure of nobility, also translated by Norman Davies as Test of Nobility was a legal procedure of the revocation of nobility in the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Due to the absence of formalized heraldry laws and lineage in early Poland, nobility of a person was tested in a regular court. The confirmation of nobility was based on calling for a certain number of witnesses. In Poland this was in accordance with a 1633 statute, in Lithuania by Chapter 3, Article 22 of a 1588 Statute. The latter demanded two witnesses each from the maternal and paternal side. The penalty for perjury was being stripped of own szlachta status by 1601. In case of the successful nagana, the accuser earned up to half of the property of the accused, the other half going to the state. The justice was highly prone to miscarriage, in particular, to abusive ennoblement Therefore, this procedure was gradually restricted in various ways. After 1581, the procedures took place before either the Crown Tribunal or the Lithuanian Tribunal. Norman Davies conjectures that this practice was among the factors leading to the establishment of a unique Polish practice of heraldic families (Polish: ród heraldyczny, \""heraldic clans\"", by Davies).

"The Hobart Private Hospital is a 146 bed private hospital located in the central business [[district]] of Hobart adjacent to the Royal Hobart Hospital. It is owned by [[Healthscope]], one of Australia's leading providers of hospitals, medical and pathology centres. The Hobart [[Private]] Hospital provides private health care specialising in the areas of emergency, cardiac, maternity, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, urology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, respiratory medicine, rehab and general surgery. History-The Hobart Private Hospital was established in 1999 following the Government of Tasmania's decision to privatise the Queen Alexandria maternity wing attached to the Royal Hobart Hospital. Many were opposed to the privatisation of the wing, but it was a policy agenda of Tony Rundle's Liberal Party (in power 1996-1998) to privatise the bulk of Tasmania's public infrastructure. Australian Hospital Care Limited purchased the site following the sale of the Queen Alexandra wing in 1999, but soon found themselves compulsorily purchased by Mayne Nickless Limited (now [[Mayne]] Group Limited). Despite the Liberal Party's determination to make their policy of privatisation of public infrastructure work, the private sector in Hobart, which is a relatively small market, was already well served by Calvary Hospital, St Johns Calvary Hospital and St Helens Private Hospital, and Hobart Private was experiencing financial difficulties within months of opening. Despite frequent requests from the board of the Royal Hobart Hospital to the Tasmanian Government for them to reacquire the site in order that the RHH could make much need expansions, the owners of Hobart Private refused to sell unless all three of their Tasmanian Hospitals were bought in one package. By 2001 Healthscope had bought Hobart Private from Mayne Health, and through shrewd management made it profitable. The Royal continued to apply pressure on the government to buy the site, as they were becoming desperate to expand, but Healthscope, now turning a profit, rejected it out of hand. Also the increasing need to turn profit for shareholders led to a reduction of service provision, and the Liberal's grand vision of a private sector which would solve all of the government's healthcare problems was falling apart. In 2005 premier Paul Lennon again [[requested]] the return of the site in order to aid the desperate [[need]] for the Royal's redevelopment, but the request was again flatly refused by [[Healthscope]]. By June 2005, the Hbart Private was having problems with [[accreditiation]] and facilities management, and even had to be evacuated due to flooding. By August 2005 the Hobart Private Hospital had been flagged by Australia's national healthcare standards organisation as one of 26 hospitals nationally that was failing to meet required standards, however this report was claimed to be misrepresentative by Healthscope's chief medical officer, Michael Coglin.","The Hobart Private Hospital is a 146 bed private hospital located in the central business [[ward]] of Hobart adjacent to the Royal Hobart Hospital.

[[It]] is the sixth major [[installment]] in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical [[timeframe]] precedes that of Assassin's Creed III (2012), though its [[modern-day]] sequences succeed III's own. Black Flag was first released on the PlayStation 3, [[Xbox]] 360, and Nintendo Wii U in October 2013 and a [[month]] [[later]] on the [[PlayStation]] 4, Microsoft Windows, and [[Xbox]] [[One]]. [[The]] plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and [[follows]] the centuries-old [[struggle]] between the Assassins, who [[fight]] for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through [[control]]. The framing story is set in the 21st century and describes the player as an Abstergo agent. The main story is set in the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, and follows notorious [[pirate]] Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin's [[Creed]] [[III]] protagonists Ratonhnhaké:ton and Haytham Kenway respectively, who stumble upon the Assassin/Templar conflict. Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on ship-based [[exploration]] of the seamless open world map, while also [[retaining]] the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game spans across the Caribbean with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau and Kingston along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway [[captains]] the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet. Assassin's [[Creed]] IV: Black [[Flag]] was positively received upon release, and was one of the best selling games of 2013. [[It]] has sold more than 11 million [[copies]] to date. Critics praised the massive open world [[gameplay]], numerous side-quests, graphics and [[improved]] naval combat. [[The]] light-hearted [[pirate]] theme and engaging [[story]] were well received by critics. The modern day story however, [[received]] a [[slightly]] more mixed [[response]], while criticism fell on [[aspects]] of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. [[The]] game received several [[awards]] and [[nominations]], including [[winning]] the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best [[Action]] Adventure [[Game]]. It was followed by Assassin's Creed Unity and [[Assassin's]] Creed Rogue, [[set]] during the French Revolution and Seven [[Years']] War [[respectively]], with both released in November 2014.","[[bloody]] Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 [[games]] [[core]] [[gaming]] developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.

The framing story is set in the 21st century and describes the player as an Abstergo agent. The main story is set in the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, and follows notorious [[captain]] Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin's [[creed]] [[tournament]] protagonists Ratonhnhaké:ton and Haytham Kenway respectively, who stumble upon the Assassin/Templar conflict. Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on ship-based [[gameplay]] of the seamless open world map, while also [[allowing]] the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game spans across the Caribbean with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau and Kingston along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway [[is]] the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet.

"Tactical [[Imagery-Intelligence]] Wing (TIW) is a 1 Group Force Element, based at RAF Marham. TIW is responsible for the processing and exploitation of fast-jet [[electro-optical]] imagery, on deployed operations, exercises and routine training. [[Fast-jet]] imagery has been [[analysed]] from the Raptor pod on the Tornado GR4 and the Digital Joint Reconnaissance Pod on the Jaguar, Harrier and Tornado GR4. TIW is also responsible for providing specialist training of all Imagery Analysts within 1 Group. TIW formed in April 2002 from II (AC), XIII and 39 (1 PRU) Sqn RICs (Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre). No. 41(F) Sqn RIC became part of TIW in April 2003. The formal grouping of what were previously four separate RICs brings benefits in ensuring a more coherent approach against a common set of standards. Traditionally, TIW was considered to be part of the role known as tactical reconnaissance or tac recce. As traditional tasking and reporting has evolved to provide a much broader, more complex and often more dynamic set of questions to—and range of products from—TIW, the term [[Combat-aircraft]] ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target-Acquisition and Reconnaissance) much better describes the role of TIW and the aircraft that collect the imagery.","Tactical [[strike]] Wing (TIW) is a 1 Group Force Element, based at RAF Marham.
