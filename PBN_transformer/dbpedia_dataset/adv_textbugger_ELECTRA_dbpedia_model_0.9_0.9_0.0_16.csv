In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute.

"The 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was held on Sunday, 22 May 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias. At stake were all 45 seats in the General Junta, determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. The FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco √Ålvarez Cascos, former Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as PP's candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture voting of √Ålvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration. The resulting government, however, was not able to gather legislative support to approve its 2012 regional budget, with both PP and PSOE blocking the vote, resulting in a fresh election being held in March 2012.","The 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[electi–æn]] was held on Sunday, 22 May 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias.

"[[The]] [[Raid]] on Griessie was a [[British]] [[attack]] on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. [[The]] raid was the final action in a series of engagements fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch [[squadron]] with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron‚Äîunder the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew‚Äîsought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia [[raid]] however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander‚ÄîCaptain Cowell‚Äîrefused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on Madura. [[With]] the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated.

"[[James]] [[Edwin]] [[Campbell]] ([[July]] [[7]], 1843 ‚Äì [[December]] 18, [[1924]]) was a [[Democratic]] [[politician]] from [[Ohio]]. [[He]] [[served]] as the 38th [[Governor]] of Ohio. Campbell was [[born]] in Middletown, Ohio where he [[attended]] the public schools and then [[Miami]] University. He [[served]] in the Union [[Army]] as a [[member]] of the Mississippi [[River]] Squadron during the [[Civil]] [[War]]. He was a [[master's]] [[mate]] on the [[gunboats]] Elk and [[Naiad]] until his health [[gave]] out and he returned [[home]] emaciated. James Campbell was [[admitted]] to the [[bar]] in 1865 and began [[practicing]] law in Hamilton, Ohio two [[years]] later. Campbell was married to Maud Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, 1870. [[They]] had four children. [[He]] was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876‚Äì1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district ([[Forty-eighth]] and [[Fiftieth]] Congresses) and once from the third district ([[Forty-ninth]] Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from 1884-1889. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio governorship, serving from 1890 to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1891, losing to future president William McKinley. During his term as governor, he signed a bill enacting the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of Democrats in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895. Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio State University 1895-1896. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to codify the State of Ohio laws from 1908-1911. Campbell was nominated for Congress in 1906, but lost, and was his party's choice for Senator in 1908, but was again defeated. In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the Board of Trustees as president on September 25, 1918. He served as president until his death. He resumed the practice of law in Columbus, Ohio after 1892 and died there in 1924.

"[[Russells]] Hall Hospital is an [[NHS]] [[general]] hospital [[located]] in [[Dudley]], West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the [[borough's]] [[in-patient]] services. [[The]] first phases of the [[work]] were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had [[doubled]] in size. Much of the existing hospital was [[also]] refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 ‚Äì 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable [[rise]] in traffic, the main road towards Dudley [[town]] centre - Kingswinford [[Road]] - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999. Cricketer Ian Botham, famous for his charity work, opened a state of the art leukaemia unit at the [[hospital]] in 1998.

"[[The]] [[Ten]] Days of Brescia (Italian: Dieci giornate di Brescia) was a [[revolt]] which broke out in the northern Italian city of that name, which lasted from March 23 to April 1, 1849. In the early 19th century Brescia was part of the Austrian puppet state called Kingdom of [[Lombardy-Venetia]]. The revolt, headed by the patriot Tito Speri, began on the same day as the Battle of Novara (though news of Austria's victory there had not yet reached Brescia). The Austrian troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily cannonaded the city, damaging many of [[Brescia's]] historical monuments. A total [[encirclement]] of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the revolt, when reinforcements arrived. The following day General Haynau, later nicknamed \""The Hyena of Brescia\"", came and demanded the unconditioned surrender of the [[Bresciani]].

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

"AIA [[Group]] [[Limited]] known as AIA (Chinese: [[ÂèãÈÇ¶‰øùÈö™ÊéßËÇ°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏]]) is the largest independent public [[listed]] pan-Asian life insurance [[group]]. It has a presence in 18 markets in [[Asia-Pacific]], wholly [[owned]] branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, [[Macau]], Brunei, a [[97]]% subsidiary in [[Sri]] Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and [[representative]] offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA [[traces]] its roots back to [[1919]] when an enterprising young [[man]] [[named]] Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually [[expanded]] his business throughout [[Asia]], the US, and worldwide. In [[1945]], he [[relocated]] his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. [[Thus]] the [[Asian]] AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later [[fell]] through, and AIA [[held]] an IPO in October 2010, [[raising]] approximately HK$[[159]].08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September [[2012]], AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of ‚Ç¨1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Waxhaws ([[also]] [[known]] as the Waxhaws or Waxhaw massacre, and Buford's massacre) took place during the American Revolutionary [[War]] on [[May]] 29, [[1780]], near Lancaster, [[South]] [[Carolina]], between a Continental Army force [[led]] by Abraham Buford and a [[mainly]] [[Loyalist]] force [[led]] by British [[officer]] [[Banastre]] Tarleton.

"William Harold [[Lee]] (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a prot√©g√© of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg.

"Deep [[Space]] Climate [[Observatory]] (DSCOVR; formerly known as Triana, unofficially known as GoreSat) is a NOAA Earth observation and space weather [[satellite]] launched by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle on February 11, 2015 from Cape [[Canaveral]]. It was originally developed as a NASA satellite proposed in 1998 by then-Vice President Al Gore for the purpose of Earth observation. It is in a Lissajous orbit at the Sun-Earth L1 [[Lagrangian]] point, 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth, to monitor variable solar wind condition, provide early warning of approaching coronal mass ejections and observe phenomena on Earth including changes in ozone, aerosols, dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, vegetation cover and climate. At this location it has a continuous view of the Sun and the sunlit side of the Earth. The satellite is orbiting the Sun-Earth L1 point in a six-month period, with a [[spacecraft-Earth-Sun]] angle varying from 4 to 15 degrees.

"George Elliott [[Hagan]] (May 24, 1916 ‚Äì December 26, 1990) was an [[American]] politician, businessman and farmer and a Democrat. Hagan was [[born]] in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the [[University]] of Georgia in Athens.

"[[Iddo]] \""Snowy\"" [[Munro]] ([[26]] [[March]] [[1888]] ‚Äì [[27]] October 1980) was an [[Australian]] [[racing]] [[cyclist]]. [[The]] [[highlights]] of his [[career]] were [[winning]] the [[Australasian]] long distance road [[championship]] in [[1909]] and [[competing]] in the [[1914]] Tour de France.

In [[1914]], Munro and Don [[Kirkham]] were the first Australian [[cyclists]] to compete in the Tour de France.

Dark Discoveries then became a color publication in 2009 after Jason V Brock became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni Productions, LLC, who also maintained the Dark Discoveries website) and Art Director in 2008, helping to salvage the magazine from being discontinued by publisher Beach. Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press.

"[[The]] [[Nedbank]] Golf [[Challenge]], [[previously]] [[known]] as the Million [[Dollar]] [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] [[men's]] [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the [[Gary]] Player [[Country]] Club in Sun [[City]], North West province, South Africa. [[Originally]] it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the major [[tours]], but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in [[professional]] golf, it takes [[place]] between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early [[November]], and Christmas. [[It]] usually attracts many of the [[world's]] highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999.

"Henry Lee [[Prather]] (October 10, 1886 ‚Äì September 23, 1964) was an [[American]] [[football]] and [[basketball]] [[coach]]. He served as the head football [[coach]] at the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute for one season in 1912, compiling a record of 3‚Äì4. He is best known, however, for his [[tenures]] as the head football and men's basketball coach at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Prather coached the Demons' football team between 1913 and 1917, and again from 1919 through 1933. The 1918 season was canceled because of World [[War]] I. In 20 seasons as coach at [[NSU]], Prather compiled an overall record of 79‚Äì51‚Äì14. Including his one season at SLII, his overall football record was 82‚Äì55‚Äì14.

The leaves are needle-like, 13-25 mm long, rhombic in cross-section, bluish-green with conspicuous stomatal lines. The cones are cylindric, 7-11 cm long and 3 cm broad, maturing pale brown 5-7 months after pollination, and have stiff, smoothly rounded scales. It is closely related to the dragon spruce from western China.

"Perfect [[Records]] was a United States-based record [[label]] [[founded]] in 1922 by Path√© Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way [[tended]] to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.","Perfect [[Recors]] was a United States-based record [[l…ëbel]] [[foun‘Åed]] in 1922 by Path√© Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.",0

"Pandora (/p√¶nÀàd…î…ôr…ô/ [[pan-DOHR-…ô]]; Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œéœÅŒ±) is an inner [[satellite]] of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby [[Prometheus]], and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on [[moon's]] surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with [[Prometheus]]. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the [[periapsis]] of Pandora lines up with the [[apoapsis]] of [[Prometheus]] and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi).

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7¬±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72¬±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 ‚Äì a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

"[[Anthelm]] of Belley ([[1107]]‚Äì[[1178]]) was a prior of the Carthusian Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. He was [[born]] near Chamb√©ry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the [[area]] of Belley. When he was thirty years [[old]], he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at [[Portes]]. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had [[recently]] incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and [[fervency]]. He [[restored]] and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow [[women]] the [[opportunity]] to enter the order in their own houses.

Anthelm returned to Belley to help [[care]] for the poor and the lepers of the area. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178.

"The [[Darshan]] [[Museum]] is a [[museum]] in Pune, India, dedicated to the noted Sindhi Saint and scholar, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani. It is a biographical museum that offers an insight into the life and therefore the teachings of Sadhu Vaswani. The museum is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the Sadhu Vaswani Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings ‚Äì in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, holographic screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011. At the function he went on to felicitate the people who contributed majorly to the project and held a candid question and answer session with revered J. P. Vaswani.

The [[village's]] character changed slowly into a tourist resort as the demand for beach recreation rose from about the middle of the 19th century. Zoutelande was a separate municipality until 1966, when it became a part of the new municipality Valkenisse. Nowadays, tourism is [[Zoutelande's]] most important source of [[existence]]. Zoutelande, together with the beach of Dishoek and Westkapelle, are often called \""Zeeland's Rivi√®ra\"", after the famous south-coast of France. It is one of Zeeland's most-visited coasts, and one of the few places in the Netherlands where the beach faces south. Plenty of rooms, studios, bungalows and apartments are available to thousands of visitors every summer; most of the tourists are of German origin, although other nationalities are also widely represented. The remaining agriculture in the area benefits of the demand for accommodation in the form of mini-campings.

He attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. [[Galimore]] possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed [[Galimore]] could run [[side-to-side]] down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before [[NFL]] [[scouting]] became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about [[Galimore's]] prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the [[5th]] round of the [[1956]] NFL draft.

He attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. [[Gal—ñmore]] possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed [[Galiomre]] could run [[side-t–æ-side]] down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before [[NL]] [[scouùöùing]] became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about [[Galimre's]] prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the [[5ùöùh]] round of the [[156]] NFL draft.

"[[Stambaugh]] Stadium, officially Arnold D. [[Stambaugh]] Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Youngstown, Ohio, United States, on the campus of Youngstown State University. The stadium was built in 1982, and is primarily used for American football. It is the home venue for the Youngstown State Penguins football team, a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I Football Championship Division (FCS) level and the Missouri Valley Football Conference. From 1996‚Äì2012, Stambaugh Stadium was also the home field for the YSU women's soccer team. During their time at Stambaugh, the football team has risen to become a power in FCS football, qualifying for NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs 12 times, advancing to the championship game on six occasions, and winning four national championships through the 2015 season. The stadium is also known by fans as the \""Ice Castle\"". When it opened in 1982, Stambaugh had one large grandstand on the west side, with a seating capacity of approximately 17,000. The stadium was upgraded and expanded prior to the 1997 athletic season with the addition of over 3,000 bleacher seats on the east side of the field, on the site of a practice field. In addition, a new press box was created and 14 additional luxury suites were built, along with a stadium club, which hosts the football team's weekly press conferences and is rented out for private events. In the summer of 2009, an auxiliary scoreboard was constructed in the south end zone, giving Stambaugh Stadium a scoreboard in each end zone. New reserved chairback seats were also installed during the 2009 season along with two new flagpoles next to the scoreboard in the north end zone, one for the Ohio flag and one for the United States flag. Since 1997, the stadium's capacity is 20,630, making it the largest stadium in the Missouri Valley Football Conference.

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the [[Basidiomycota]], [[form]] the subkingdom [[Dikarya]]. Its members are [[commonly]] known as the [[sac]] fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the [[Ascomycota]] are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. [[Previously]] placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or [[physiological]] similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for [[medicinally]] important compounds, such as antibiotics and for [[making]] bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and [[plants]].

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the [[Canadian]] province of Ontario, at an [[estimated]] 693 m ([[2]],[[274]] ft) above [[sea]] level. Ishpatina [[Ridge]] [[rises]] approximately 300 m (984 ft) above the immediate area. It was only truly recognized as Ontario's highest point after federal government topographical mapping [[revealed]] this fact in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. [[The]] ridge lies in [[Lady]] [[Evelyn-Smoothwater]] [[Provincial]] Park. Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The [[closest]] major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km [[north]]. There are a few logging [[roads]] and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the [[town]] of Capreol [[north]] of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are [[numerous]] portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. The name \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an Ojibwe language word [[ishpadinaa]], meaning \""high [[place]]/[[ridge]]\"". The city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette County, and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same word. Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) higher than Ishpatina Ridge's rise over Scarecrow Lake. An abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original tower was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The towerman would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have hiked a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact.

After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a [[consumer]] advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. [[As]] attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v.

In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996.

As a result, a band called Asia Featuring John Payne exists as a continuation of John Payne's career as Asia's frontman from 1991 until Wetton's return in 2006. In 2013, Howe retired from the band to continue with Yes and pursue other projects, and was replaced by guitarist Sam Coulson, completing the current lineup.",0

The story focuses on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a [[sixteen-year-old]] high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow [[student]] Narumi Seiwa in class. It is [[revealed]] that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. [[Later]] when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to [[avoid]] Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"S√£o Paulo LGBT Pride Parade (Portuguese: Parada do Orgulho LGBT de S√£o Paulo) is an annual gay pride parade that [[happens]] in Avenida Paulista, in the city of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, since 1997. In the year of 2006, it was considered the biggest pride parade of the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2010, the city hall of S√£o Paulo invested R$ 1 million reais in the parade. The event is the second largest of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best of the world. The Pride and its associated events are organized by the APOGLBT, Associa√ß√£o da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais, since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities as well as to the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual S√£o Paulo Gay Pride Parade. The meeting point is at the Museum of Art of S√£o Paulo (MASP ‚Äì Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo) right at the middle of S√£o Paulo's postcard Avenida Paulista. Even though the meeting time is at 12 noon, the parade doesn't start to move before 2 or 3 PM. The parade is 2.6 miles long (4.2 km) and starts at Avenida Paulista (MASP), at around noon. It follows Rua da Consola√ß√£o to the end at [[Pra√ßa]] Roosevelt, in Downtown S√£o Paulo, at around 10 PM. Strongly supported by the State and the City of S√£o Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan. These are last [[year's]] numbers: approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds.

"The [[slaty-backed]] gull (Larus [[schistisagus]]) is a large white-headed gull that breeds on the western coast of Alaska but travels widely during nonbreeding seasons. It is similar in appearance to the western gull and the [[glaucous-winged]] gull. Another alternate name is Pacific gull, though this also applies to a southern hemisphere species, Larus pacificus. Claims have been made as to its (sometimes occasional) presence throughout North America as well as the eastern coast of Asia. On November 3, 2012, an individual was spotted in Finland. The species has only been spotted three times before in Europe. It measures 55‚Äì68.5 cm (21.7‚Äì27.0 in) in length, 132‚Äì160 cm (52‚Äì63 in) in wingspan and weighs 1.05‚Äì1.7 kg (2.3‚Äì3.7 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 40.6 to 48 cm (16.0 to 18.9 in), the bill is 4.8 to 6.5 cm (1.9 to 2.6 in) and the [[tarsus]] is 6 to 7.6 cm (2.4 to 3.0 in). It has a white head, belly, and tail with a dark [[slaty-gray]] back and wings with a broad white trailing edge. The wings and back are slightly darker than those of the Western Gull. The underside of the wings features a \""string of pearls\"" pattern along their edges; these can be seen from below when the bird is in flight. Its eyes are yellow. The legs are pink and short when compared with those of similar-looking gulls, and the body appears more stout. The bill is yellow with orange-red [[subterminal]] spot. Immature gulls' plumage is brown, similar to that of the great black-backed gull, but paler, and is practically indistinguishable from the immature [[herring]] gull in the [[field]].","The [[slaty-b…ëcked]] gull (Larus [[schistisa…°us]]) is a large white-headed gull that breeds on the western coast of Alaska but travels widely during nonbreeding seasons.

"The [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates.

"Dolomedes /[[d…íl…ôÀàmiÀêdiÀêz]]/ is a [[genus]] of large spiders of the family Pisauridae. They are also known as [[fishing]] spiders, [[raft]] spiders, dock spiders or [[wharf]] spiders. Almost all Dolomedes species are semi-aquatic, with the exception of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the southwestern United States.

They hunt by waiting at the edge of a pool or [[stream]], then when they [[detect]] the ripples from [[prey]], they [[run]] across the surface to [[subdue]] it [[using]] their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; [[like]] other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to [[kill]] and [[digest]] the [[prey]].

"The [[Taradale]] Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for ¬£3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O‚ÄôHara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society‚Äôs Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. The bridge is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.","The [[Ta‚≤Öadale]] Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia.

"Wilhelm Eugen Johansen (1 February 1892 ‚Äì 31 December 1973) was a Norwegian horse rider who competed in the 1920 Summer Olympics, in the 1928 Summer Olympics, and in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] FRCS (September 28, [[1868]] ‚Äì June 23, [[1963]]), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of [[Toronto]] and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the [[Royal]] College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the [[rank]] of [[colonel]] in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). [[Bruce]] [[investigated]] medical practices in the army and [[issued]] a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. [[Few]] of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. [[Bruce's]] report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. [[Bennett]] for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the [[vice-regal]] office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' [[Keenor]] (31 July 1894 ‚Äì November 1972) was a Welsh professional footballer and Wales international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after [[impressing]] in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A [[hard-tackling]] Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the [[Southern]] Football League before his [[spell]] at the [[club]] was [[interrupted]] by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor [[served]] in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, [[suffering]] a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. [[After]] lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his [[shrapnel]] [[wound]], Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1‚Äì0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside [[England's]] borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[ageing]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third [[Division]] South in the [[1930]]‚Äì31 season, when he was released.

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] SL (1 November [[1609]] ‚Äì 25 [[December]] [[1676]]) was an influential [[English]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a [[strict]] Puritan, and inherited his [[faith]]. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barrister]] like his [[father]] thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[joined]] [[Lincoln's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on [[17]] [[May]] [[1636]]. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the [[English]] Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[William]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his [[state]] trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] [[used]]. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the [[Commission's]] [[dissolution]], [[Oliver]] [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] Pleas. As a [[judge]], Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his [[willingness]] to [[make]] politically [[unpopular]] decisions which upheld the law. He [[sat]] in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of [[Parliament]] who moved to [[consider]] Charles [[II's]] [[reinstatement]] as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. [[Under]] Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King's]] Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a [[particularly]] innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he [[retired]] on 20 [[February]] [[1676]], dying [[ten]] months later on 25 [[December]] [[1676]]. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, [[published]] after his death.

Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[∆º]], Hale was raised by his [[fathe‚≤Ö's]] relative, a [[stricùöù]] Puritan, and inherited his [[faiùöùh]]. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[Col‚Öºege]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barriste‚≤Ö]] like his [[fathe‚≤Ö]] thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[joine‘Å]] [[Linco‚Öºn's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on [[1ùüï]] [[My]] [[1366]]. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the [[Engli—ïh]] Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[WilliaÔΩç]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his [[staùöùe]] trial, and conceived the [[defenœ≤e]] [[Charle—ï]] [[usd]]. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political [[neutraliùöùy]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[mae]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the [[Commis—ïion's]] [[dissoluti–æn]], [[Olive‚≤Ö]] [[Cromwel‚Öº]] made him a Justice of the [[ComÔΩçon]] Pleas. As a [[j]] [[udge]], Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his [[willingnes—ï]] to [[mae]] politically [[unp–æpular]] decisions which upheld the law. He [[saùöù]] in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of [[Parliamenùöù]] who moved to [[conside‚≤Ö]] Charles [[II`s]] [[reinstat–µment]] as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. [[Undr]] Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King'—ï]] Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a [[pa]] [[rticularly]] innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he [[retire‘Å]] on 20 [[Februa‚≤Öy]] [[1]] [[676]], dying [[tn]] months later on 25 [[Decembe‚≤Ö]] [[1766]].

"The 1904‚Äì05 [[Football]] League [[season]] was [[Small]] Heath [[Football]] Club's 13th in the Football League and their [[5th]] in the First Division.

Common names include cypress, sandplain-cypress and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus [[Callitris]]. There are three species in the genus, all endemic to southwestern Western Australia: \n* [[Actinostrobus]] acuminatus - Dwarf cypress, Creeping pine, Moore cypress pine \n* Actinostrobus arenarius - Sandplain-cypress \n* Actinostrobus pyramidalis - Swan river cypress, [[Swamp]] cypress, Western Australian swamp cypress, King George's cypress [[pine]] A 2010 study of Actinostrobus and Callitris has placed all three species of Actinostrobus within an [[expanded]] Callitris based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical characters. They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3‚Äì8 m (9.[[8]]‚Äì26.2 ft) tall. [[The]] leaves are evergreen, of [[two]] forms; juvenile [[needle-like]] leaves 10‚Äì20 mm (0.39‚Äì0.79 in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult [[leaves]], 2‚Äì8 mm (0.[[079]]‚Äì0.315 in) long with only the [[apex]] free. [[The]] [[leaves]] are [[arranged]] in six rows along the [[twigs]], in alternating whorls of [[three]]. The [[male]] cones are small, 3‚Äì6 [[mm]] (0.[[12]]‚Äì0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out [[similarly]] inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10‚Äì20 mm (0.39‚Äì0.79 in) long and wide, globular to [[acute-ovoid]], with [[six]] thick, [[woody]] scales, arranged in [[two]] whorls of three, and a further nine to [[fifteen]] thin, [[sterile]] basal scales. [[The]] cones remain [[closed]] on the trees for [[many]] years, opening only after being scorched by a bushfire; this then releases the seeds to grow on the newly [[cleared]] burnt [[ground]]. The closest relative of Actinostrobus is Callitris, which is much more widespread, occurring in most of [[Australia]], and differs in its cones lacking the [[basal]] whorls of [[small]] sterile [[scales]]. The wood of Actinostrobus is [[light]], [[soft]] and aromatic, but the plants are too small for any significant use. They are occasionally planted as ornamental shrubs, but their use is restricted by the high risks imposed by their very high flammability in bushfires.","[[Actinostrobu—ï]] is a genus of coniferous trees in the [[Cupressace]] [[ae]] (cypress family).

"The SM [[Kirov]] Stadium was a [[multi-purpose]] stadium in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The stadium was named after Sergey [[Kirov]]. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world.

"Dick de [[Groot]] ([[born]] [[1920]]) was [[born]] in [[Scheveningen]], a beach suburb of [[The]] Hague in the Netherlands.
