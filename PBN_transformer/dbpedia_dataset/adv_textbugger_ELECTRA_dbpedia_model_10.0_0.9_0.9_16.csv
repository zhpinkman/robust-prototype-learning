"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fix𝚝ure]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"Augustus [[George]] [[Hazard]] (April [[28]], 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an [[American]] [[manufacturer]] of gunpowder and the [[namesake]] of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was born in [[Kingston]], Rhode [[Island]] on [[April]] 28, 1802, a [[son]] of [[Thomas]] and Silence Knowles Hazard. [[His]] [[family]] moved to [[Connecticut]] when he was six years [[old]]. [[As]] a young [[man]], he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In [[1827]] he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of [[gunpowder]] and other products. In [[1837]] he bought into a gunpowder [[production]] [[company]] that had been established [[two]] years [[earlier]] on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed [[sole]] [[ownership]] of the [[company]] in [[1843]]. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder [[Company]] and the village that supported it [[became]] [[known]] as Hazardville. During the [[early]] [[years]] of the [[Civil]] War, Col. [[Hazard]] was under suspicion by the [[federal]] government as being sympathetic to the [[Southern]] Cause. [[It]] was well [[known]] that he was a good [[friend]] of [[Confederate]] President [[Jefferson]] Davis, and that he lived in the [[South]] and had [[developed]] many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly [[expand]] their facilities to meet [[war]] [[time]] production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was [[supplying]] the Union [[Forces]] with [[12]],500 lbs of powder a day. The mill at Hazardville was in [[operation]] [[24]] hours a [[day]] and [[produced]] [[40]]% of all the gunpowder used during the Civil [[War]] by the Union. [[Hazard]] lived on [[Enfield]] Street in Enfield, several miles from the powder mill, and [[ran]] the business until his [[death]] on May 7, 1868, at the Ascot House in New York City.","Augustus [[Gеorge]] [[Hɑzard]] (April [[2Ȣ]], 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an [[Amerіcan]] [[manufacturеr]] of gunpowder and the [[namesa𝒌e]] of Hazardville, Connecticut.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a fictional [[chaⲅacter]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.",0

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"The Grand Rapids Hotel also [[known]] as the The Grand Rapids [[Resort]], was a hotel that [[existed]] outside of Mount Carmel, [[Illinois]] in Wabash [[County]], [[Illinois]], United [[States]] in Southern [[Illinois]] from 1922 to 1929. The hotel was [[located]] on the [[Wabash]] River [[next]] to the [[Grand]] [[Rapids]] Dam on [[land]] that was originally purchased by Thomas S. [[Hinde]]. [[Before]] the hotel was [[built]], the [[property]] where the [[hotel]] was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick [[Hinde]] Zimmerman for multiple small [[shops]] that sold goods to fisherman and tourists. [[Frederick]] Hinde Zimmerman was the founder and [[owner]] of the hotel, and he completed construction and [[opened]] the hotel to the public on August 7, [[1922]]. [[The]] [[hotel]] had 36 [[rooms]] and one large assembly [[room]] that [[served]] as a [[dining]] [[room]], meeting hall, and was used for weddings, exhibitions, [[anniversaries]], and other [[important]] occasions. The hotel was one of the [[first]] [[major]] [[resorts]] on the [[southern]] [[portion]] of the [[Wabash]] River and [[quickly]] was able to attract tourist from [[across]] the country because of its location on the river and ease of [[access]] provided by the railroad. During its [[9-year]] [[existence]] the hotel [[established]] a [[reputation]] for luxury and high quality.

"[[Andrew]] George Silver ([[born]] 13 [[January]] [[1967]] in [[London]], England) is a [[former]] [[international]] [[motorcycle]] speedway [[rider]] who [[represented]] [[England]] at test level.

"(This article is about administrative body formed in 2000. For the similar body that existed until 1986, see Greater London Council.) The Greater London Authority ([[GLA]]) is a top-tier administrative body for Greater London, England. It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax. The GLA is unique in the British local government system, in terms of structure, elections and selection of powers. The authority was established to replace a range of joint boards and quangos and provided an elected upper tier of local government in London for the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986.","(This article is about administrative body formed in 2000.

It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax. The GLA is unique in the British local government system, in terms of structure, elections and selection of powers. The authority was established to replace a range of joint boards and quangos and provided an elected upper tier of local government in London for the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986.",0
"Perfect [[Records]] was a [[United]] [[States-based]] record label founded in [[1922]] by [[Pathé]] Records to produce cheap 78 rpm [[discs]]. Many issues of [[Perfect]] records were pressed in [[red-brown]] shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the [[era]]. [[Pathe's]] [[acoustic]] recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by [[wind-up]] phonographs of the day. [[Their]] slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on [[Perfect]] included [[Gene]] Autry, Annette [[Hanshaw]], Willard [[Robison]], Al Bernard, Big Bill [[Broonzy]], Cab [[Calloway]], [[Vernon]] Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele [[Ike]]\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, [[The]] Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the [[New]] [[York]] [[area]] orchestras and [[studio]] groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record [[Corporation]] (ARC) in [[July]] [[1929]]. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and [[Perfect]] continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their [[entire]] group of cheaper labels in [[late]] 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on [[78]] r.p.m. vinyl by Sun [[City]] Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, [[The]] Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.","Perfect [[Recordѕ]] was a [[Uniteԁ]] [[States-baseԁ]] record label founded in [[192ᒿ]] by [[P]] [[athé]] Records to produce cheap 78 rpm [[ԁiscs]].

"[[Girl]] Germs was a zine created by University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, both members of the band Bratmobile. Feminism was influential in the Pacific Northwest in the early nineties: Girl Germs heralded an explosion of zines that accompanied the rebirth of [[feminism]]. These zines included Ms America,Satan Wears A Bra, [[Fantastic]] Fanzine, I (heart) Amy [[Carter]] and others. Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school. Contributors to Girl Germs included Kathleen Hanna; Jean Smith of Mecca Normal; Sue P. Fox; Kaia Wilson; the editors of Double Bill, G.B. Jones, Jena von Brücker, Caroline Azar, Johnny Noxzema and Rex; Jen Smith; and Erin Smith of Bratmobile. Groups interviewed by Girl Germs editors include Calamity Jane, Unrest, 7 Year Bitch, Jawbox and Fastbacks. Girl Germs also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time. Allison would go on to play with Cold Cold Hearts, Partyline, and Hawnay Troof and Molly played with The Frumpies and The PeeChees.

"Pandora (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; [[Greek]]: [[Πανδώρα]]) is an inner [[satellite]] of [[Saturn]].

[[In]] late [[1985]] it was officially named after Pandora from [[Greek]] [[mythology]]. [[It]] is [[also]] designated as [[Saturn]] XVII. Pandora was thought to be an [[outer]] shepherd [[satellite]] of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a [[role]], and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than [[nearby]] Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on [[Pandora]] are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also [[present]] on moon's [[surface]]. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high [[albedo]], it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus [[hired]] [[6]],500 [[Catalan]] [[mercenaries]] under [[Roger]] [[de]] Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred.

[[Hops]] [[Infusion]] is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for [[aging]] bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into [[Blasphemy]]. These [[four]] styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

"Edward Mann was a [[London-based]] [[hatmaker]] and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century. While Mann was working as a milliner in the 1950s, he became particularly known for his creative 1960s designs, such as designs with incorporated pockets and lace baby-bonnet-style caps. In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana [[Rigg]] as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers.

The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), [[Phil]] Lesh ([[bass]], [[vocals]]), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums).

"The Arkansas RiverBlades was a short-lived minor-league ice hockey [[team]] located in North Little Rock, Arkansas.

The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change.

"The men's 100 [[metres]] was of [[one]] of [[23]] [[track]] events of the athletics at the 2004 [[Summer]] [[Olympics]], in [[Athens]]. It was [[contested]] at the Athens Olympic Stadium, from August 21 to 22, by a total of 84 sprinters from 63 nations.

In the second round, these forty runners competed in five heats, with the first three from each heat and the single next fastest runner (5×3+1=16) qualifying for the semifinals. In the semifinals, only the first four runners from each of the two heats advanced to the final (2×4=8). The final was the fastest and most disputed in Olympic history, with six runners covering the distance in 10.00 seconds or less (four of them under the 9.90 mark), and the gold and bronze medalist athletes separated by 0.02 seconds. In the final, the slowest to react was Justin Gatlin, [[still]] with the most powerful first steps, Gatlin led from the gun, with Kim Collins, the next [[slowest]] to react, also getting a typically fast start (typically in lane 1).

[[Love]] is a [[Strange]] and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] [[written]] and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name [[Mikiyo]] Tsuda) in [[2002]]. The story focuses on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] [[rail]] line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about [[45]] [[miles]] (72 [[km]]) west-northwest of [[New]] York City — to Slateford Junction near the [[Delaware]] Water Gap in Pennsylvania. [[The]] Cut-Off was 11 [[miles]] ([[18]] [[km]]) shorter than the [[Lackawanna]] Old Road, the [[rail]] line it superseded; it had a [[much]] gentler ruling [[gradient]] (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had [[42]] fewer curves, with all but one [[permitting]] [[passenger]] [[train]] speeds of [[70]] mph (110 km/h) or more. The [[Cut-Off]] also had no railroad crossings at the time of its [[construction]]. [[All]] 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the [[material]].  [[The]] construction of the [[roadbed]] required the movement of millions of tons of [[fill]] [[material]] [[using]] [[techniques]] similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, [[Lackawanna]] Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cut-Off]] remained in continual operation for [[68]] years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the [[EL's]] conveyance into Conrail in 1976. [[Conrail]] [[ceased]] operation of the Cut-Off in [[January]] 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in [[1983]], citing its excess [[east-west]] routes.

[[Te]] Cut-Off was 11 [[mileѕ]] ([[1Ȣ]] [[kｍ]]) shorter than the [[Lackaanna]] Old Road, the [[raiⅼ]] line it superseded; it had a [[mcuh]] gentler ruling [[gradien𝚝]] (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had [[4ᒿ]] fewer curves, with all but one [[permit𝚝ing]] [[passengeⲅ]] [[tran]] speeds of [[𝟕0]] mph (110 km/h) or more. The [[Ct-Off]] also had no railroad crossings at the time of its [[construc𝚝ion]]. [[Al]] 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the [[mɑterial]].  [[Te]] construction of the [[roadbeԁ]] required the movement of millions of tons of [[filⅼ]] [[materiaⅼ]] [[uѕing]] [[techniqueѕ]] similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, [[Lackaԝanna]] Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cu-Off]] remained in continual operation for [[6Ȣ]] years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the [[ELs]] conveyance into Conrail in 1976. [[Cornail]] [[cased]] operation of the Cut-Off in [[Januaⲅy]] 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in [[193]], citing its excess [[east-wet]] routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, [[N]] [[ew]] Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.",2

"Turkey, [[whose]] relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar [[Assad's]] father Hafez [[al-Assad]] expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria.

Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory.

Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. [[During]] the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a [[chance]] to qualify for the semi-final.

This [[rowіng]] event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single [[roweⲅ]]. The \""[[scul]]\"" portion means that the rower uses two [[oɑrs]], one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with [[sԝeep]] rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple [[rou]] [[nds]]. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. [[Duⲅing]] the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a [[cahnce]] to qualify for the semi-final.

"The National Football League [[playoffs]] for the 2010 season began on January 8, 2011.

This was the first time that the new postseason overtime rules were in effect, although none of the playoff games this season ended up going into the extra session.
