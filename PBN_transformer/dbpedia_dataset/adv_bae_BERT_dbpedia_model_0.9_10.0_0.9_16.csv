"On [[20]] October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On [[2nd]] October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"Augustus George Hazard ([[April]] 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut.

As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the [[village]] that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early [[years]] of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships.

"Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (Arabic: محمد أحمد ابن عبد الله; August 12, 1844 – June 22, 1885) was a religious leader of the Samaniyya order in Sudan who, on June 29, 1881, proclaimed himself the Mahdi, the messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith. His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Sudanese population towards the oppressive policies of the Turco-Egyptian rulers, and capitalized on the messianic beliefs popular among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. More broadly, the Mahdiyya, as Muhammad Ahmad's movement was called, was influenced by earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, as well as Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism that developed in reaction to the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century. From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan (known as the Turkiyah).

"The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual [[men's]] professional golf tournament played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an official money event for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many [[high-profile]] unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. The 2016 event will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available players from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The remainder of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years winner of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations. From 2010 to 2012, a separate tournament for senior golfers was held concurrently and called the Nedbank Champions Challenge.","The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual [[golf]] professional golf tournament played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa.

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, [[petitioned]] Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in 1290. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland. He died on 9 December 1298.","Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope.

"Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a prior of the Carthusian [[Grand]] Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. [[He]] was born near Chambéry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm [[continued]] in his office almost constantly for twenty-four [[years]], barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and helped defend the sitting Pope Alexander [[III]] against the antipope Victor IV. Alexander III [[appointed]] Anthelm bishop of Belley in 1163. In that [[position]], he is said to have been fearless and uncompromising, [[working]] to reform the clergy and regulate the [[affairs]] of the diocese. One example of his fearlessness [[occurred]] in 1175, when Anthelm excommunicated Count Humbert of Maurienne for having [[taken]] [[one]] priest captive and murdering another priest who had [[tried]] to [[free]] him. Humbert appealed his excommunication to Pope [[Alexander]] III, who reversed Humbert's excommunication. Anthelm, who believed that Humbert was not penitent for his [[misconduct]], withdrew from his diocese in protest. Pope Alexander then commissioned Anthelm to travel to England to try to reconcile Henry II of England and Thomas Becket. Anthelm's [[health]] was such that he was unable to [[take]] the journey. Anthelm returned to Belley to help care for the poor and the lepers of the [[area]]. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178.

Kon received a public beating for his defection but was soon assigned to lead the construction of Bely [[embankment]] - a 10-kilometer outer ring of Moscow fortress that stood on the path of present-day Boulevard Ring. His best known project, the Kremlin of Smolensk, was launched by Boris Godunov in 1597. Fyodor Kon has been the subject of an eponymous poem by Dmitri Kedrin (1940).",0

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel [[band]], likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson [[plays]] electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is [[typically]] only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of [[bassist]] Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional [[gospel]] song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for [[control]] over the remnants of the former empire of [[Mitanni]]. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) [[conquered]] Mitanni, he [[created]] two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the [[large]] [[part]] of [[territories]] of this kingdom between his allies. [[The]] [[rest]] of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a [[Hittite]] vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. [[During]] the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the [[Assyrians]] controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a [[Hittite]] vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian [[involvement]] in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with [[Ḫatti]]. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into [[battle]] under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor.

"The Taradale Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray [[River]] Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was [[made]] by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, [[Wiltshire]], under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard [[Kingdom]] Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent [[way]] was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[line]]. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways.

"Frederick Charles '[[Fred']] [[Keenor]] (31 July 1894 – [[November]] 1972) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of [[playing]] football again [[following]] his shrapnel wound, Keenor [[returned]] to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most [[successful]] period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a [[1]]–0 defeat to Sheffield United. [[In]] 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club [[captain]], [[leading]] the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[ageing]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA [[Cup]] and the FA Charity [[Shield]] in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign. Keenor finished his career with spells at Crewe Alexandra, Oswestry Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 caps for the Wales national football team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three occasions in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and captained the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals. Following his death in 1972, Football Association of Wales secretary Trevor Morris commented \""Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales.","Frederick Charles '[[fred]] [[rees]] (31 July 1894 – [[november]] 1972) was a Welsh professional [[league]] and Wales international.

Overcoming doubts about the possibility of [[heading]] football again [[given]] his shrapnel wound, Keenor [[reverted]] to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most [[glorious]] period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a [[three]]–0 defeat to Sheffield United. [[throughout]] 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club [[commander]], [[captain]] the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[aging]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA [[trophy]] and the FA Charity [[shields]] in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign. Keenor finished his career with spells at Crewe Alexandra, Oswestry Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 caps for the Wales national football team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three occasions in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and captained the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals. Following his death in 1972, Football Association of Wales secretary Trevor Morris commented \""Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales.",0

"The Reform movement was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed [[around]] contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse [[Ketchum]], Peter Perry, Marshall Spring [[Bidwell]], and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie.

Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game, hammering home a long range goal after 20 minutes. After that, Leeds shut up shop and a defensive performance saw them out for the rest of the match. It was the first major trophy of Don Revie's reign at Elland Road and started one of the most successful periods in the club's history. Arsenal reached the League Cup Final the following year, only to lose again (this time to Swindon Town), but went on to win both domestic and European trophies in the following seasons.",5

"The zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. It is found throughout the tropical [[Indo-Pacific]], frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62 m (203 ft). [[Adult]] zebra [[sharks]] are distinctive in [[appearance]], with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low [[caudal]] fin comprising nearly half the [[total]] length, and a pattern of dark spots on a [[pale]] background. Young zebra sharks under 50–90 cm (20–35 in) long have a [[completely]] [[different]] pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a [[brown]] background, and lack the ridges. This species [[attains]] a length of 2.5 m (8.2 ft). Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for [[molluscs]], [[crustaceans]], small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal [[aggregations]]. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Vulnerable worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.","The zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae.

"The Basque conflict, also known as the Spain–ETA conflict, was an armed and political conflict between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque organizations which sought independence from Spain and France.

"Belfast Central Library is a public library in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a [[pillared]] foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. [[The]] building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland.

"Álvaro Obregón [[Salido]] (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈalβaɾo oβɾeˈɣon]; February 19, 1880 – July 17, 1928) was a general in the Mexican Revolution, who became President of Mexico from 1920 to 1924. [[He]] supported Sonora's decision to follow Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza as leader of a revolution against the Huerta regime. Carranza [[appointed]] Obregón commander of the revolutionary forces in northwestern Mexico and in 1915 appointed him as his minister of war. In 1920, Obregón launched a revolt against Carranza, in which Carranza was assassinated; he won the subsequent election with overwhelming support. Obregón's presidency was the first stable presidency since the Revolution began in 1910. He oversaw massive educational reform (with Mexican muralism flourishing), moderate land reform, and labor laws sponsored by the increasingly powerful Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers. In August 1923, he signed the Bucareli Treaty that clarified the rights of the Mexican government and U.S. oil interests and brought U.S. diplomatic recognition to his government. In 1923–24, Obregón's finance minister, Adolfo de la Huerta, launched a rebellion in part protesting the Bucareli Treaty; Obregón returned to the battlefield to crush the rebellion. In his victory, he was aided by the United States with arms and 17 U.S. planes that bombed de la Huerta's supporters. In 1924, Obregón's fellow Northern revolutionary general and hand-picked successor, Plutarco Elías Calles, was elected president, and although Obregón ostensibly retired to Sonora, he remained influential under Calles. Having pushed through constitutional reform to once again make reelection possible, Obregón won the 1928 election, but was assassinated by José de León Toral, a Mexican offended by the government's anti-religious laws, before he could begin his second term. Toral's subsequent trial ultimately led to his execution by firing squad, and it also involved a Capuchin nun named Madre Conchita, who was thought to be the mastermind behind Obregón's murder.","Álvaro Obregón [[plaza]] (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈalβaɾo oβɾeˈɣon]; February 19, 1880 – July 17, 1928) was a general in the Mexican Revolution, who became President of Mexico from 1920 to 1924.

[[The]] rebellion [[started]] only two months after the [[end]] of the Second Balkan War. [[The]] Albanian [[government]] organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, [[crossed]] the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops.

"Elisaeus Adougan was a late 14th century and early 15th century Scottish cleric. His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390, but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ...

"Cagliostro-Walzer [[op]].[[370]] is a waltz by Johann Strauss II [[composed]] in 1875 [[based]] on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which [[premiered]] on 27 February 1875 at the famous [[Theater]] an der Wien. The [[waltz]] principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' ich mit [[Ihnen]] fliegen durchs Leben\"" or '[[Could]] [[I]] but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the [[operetta]]. [[The]] operetta itself was a success at its [[first]] performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera [[composers]] to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be [[arranged]] as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, [[thus]] he [[composed]] this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'. The entire waltz consists of just [[3]] two-part waltz sections which is [[also]] a [[new]] Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part [[sections]] heard in his [[earlier]] works. [[The]] piece began with a loud march [[melody]] in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. [[The]] principal [[waltz]] theme in C major is also in the [[style]] of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the [[waltz]] proper.

The [[dance]] principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' ich mit [[s]] fliegen durchs Leben\"" or '[[may]] [[we]] but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the [[libretto]]. [[every]] operetta itself was a success at its [[launch]] performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera [[eers]] to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be [[circulated]] as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, [[accordingly]] he [[designed]] this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'. The entire waltz consists of just [[three]] two-part waltz sections which is [[effectively]] a [[further]] Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part [[section]] heard in his [[early]] works. [[the]] piece began with a loud march [[music]] in the C major key before progressing into waltz time.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior [[team]] captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay [[staff]] and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"The Raving Loony Green Giant Party was a political party in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1989 by former members of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party (OMRLP) after clashes between them and other members of the party over direction and party activities – in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the [[OMRLP]] attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire [[by-election]], 1990 and the Ribble Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the [[OMRLP]], and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the [[OMRLP]] – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. The party became effectively defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the OMRLP. It has not stood any candidates for a number of years and is not registered with the Electoral Commission.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] ([[Norwegian]]: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which [[would]] [[serve]] the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. [[The]] [[line]] is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. The line has at various stages been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light rail, stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, [[Flytårnet]] and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at [[Fornebu]] and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to [[Fornebu]] were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the [[Drammen]] Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the site be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. The project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed schedule for construction.","The Fornebu [[system]] ([[norwegian]]: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which [[might]] [[involve]] the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway.

The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, [[mandal]] and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at [[nto]] and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to [[be]] were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the [[d]] Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the site be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. The project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed schedule for construction.",2

He corresponded regularly with the Royal Society in London—as such, one of the first American intellectuals of his time to be taken seriously in Europe.

During the nine months in 1775-1776 when Harvard moved to Concord, Massachusetts, Winthrop occupied the house which was later to become famous as The Wayside, home to Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Additionally, he was actively interested in public affairs, was for several years a judge of probate in Middlesex County, was a [[member]] of the Governor's Council in 1773-74, and [[subsequently]] offered the weight of his influence to the patriotic [[cause]] in the [[Revolution]].

Magnificent then took possession of Concorde. Shortly after surrendering, the Concorde's maintopsail caught fire, forcing the crew to cut away the mainmast to extinguish it. Prudent and St Albans arrived two hours later and Magnificent towed Concorde to St. John's, Antigua.

Magnificent gave chase and by 20:00 as darkness fell Concorde opened fire on her pursuer with her stern guns. Magnificent however overhauled the French ship by 21:15, and after fifteen minutes of fighting including a devastating broadside, forced her to strike her colours. Magnificent then took possession of Concorde. Shortly after surrendering, the Concorde's maintopsail caught fire, forcing the crew to cut away the mainmast to extinguish it. Prudent and St Albans arrived two hours later and Magnificent towed Concorde to St. John's, Antigua. Concorde served in the Royal Navy as HMS Concorde until being broken up in 1811.",5
