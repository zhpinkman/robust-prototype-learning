"On 20 October 1990, Manchester [[United]] Football Club faced Arsenal [[Football]] Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

"\""Space Invaders\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979. The song is based on the hugely successful 1978 video game Space Invaders.

The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984).

"[[Our]] Boys was a [[boys']] [[magazine]] [[published]] [[monthly]] by the [[Irish]] Christian [[Brothers]] in Ireland.

It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. [[It]] was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie. Gerrit Van Gelderen provided articles on wildlife. William Hickey wrote the \""Murphy\"" series of school stories. Another contributor was novelist Una Troy. Illustrators whose work was published in Our Boys included W. C. Mills, Gordon Brewster, George Altendorf, Gerrit van Gelderen, George Monks and M. J. O'Mullane. The [[magazine]] had a large circulation for Ireland, and advertising kept the [[magazine]] ticking over financially. A list of advertisers from the Christmas 1972 [[edition]] includes Raleigh Bicycles, Allied Irish Banks, Hector Value (toys), Department of Health, CBS Records, Walton's (musical instruments), Fred Hanna (books), Corgi Toys, Aer Lingus and Odeon Cinemas.

At a time when there was a growing sense of national self-identity in Ireland, the purpose of the Our Boys [[magazinBe]] was to compete with British boys' magazines, which were in the main pro-British Empire and pro-Church of England. It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. [[I]] was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie. Gerrit Van Gelderen provided articles on wildlife. William Hickey wrote the \""Murphy\"" series of school stories. Another contributor was novelist Una Troy. Illustrators whose work was published in Our Boys included W. C. Mills, Gordon Brewster, George Altendorf, Gerrit van Gelderen, George Monks and M. J. O'Mullane. The [[agazine]] had a large circulation for Ireland, and advertising kept the [[magazUine]] ticking over financially. A list of advertisers from the Christmas 1972 [[eMition]] includes Raleigh Bicycles, Allied Irish Banks, Hector Value (toys), Department of Health, CBS Records, Walton's (musical instruments), Fred Hanna (books), Corgi Toys, Aer Lingus and Odeon Cinemas.

"(For their \""best of\"" album, see The Best of Judas Priest: Living After Midnight.) \""Living After Midnight\"" is a [[song]] by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It was originally featured on their 1980 album British Steel, which was their first gold album in the United States selling more than 500,000 copies (and eventually went platinum for selling at least 1 million). The song speaks to the hedonistic, rebellious spirit of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is among the band's most popular songs. On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing. For example, on the DVD Rising in the East, lead vocalist Rob Halford sings, \""I took the Budokan 'bout one a.m.\"", in reference to the stadium in Tokyo, Japan, that hosted the concert. On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the new wave of British heavy metal movement). This song has been covered by The Donnas on their album The Donnas Turn 21 (2001), by Phil Gnarly and the Tough Guys at a house party in Madison, by Saul Blanch on the tribute album Acero Argentino: Tributo a Judas Priest (2006), by L.A. Guns on Hell Bent Forever: A Tribute to Judas Priest (2008) and by Iron Savior as a bonus track on the Japanese release of their Condition Red (2002) album. It was covered by Disturbed on the Tribute to British Steel (2010) CD by Metal Hammer UK music magazine, incorporating the opening drum salvo from \""Painkiller\"". It also appears as one of the bonus songs available with some distributions of Asylum (2010), and also features on their B-sides compilation album The Lost Children (2011).

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971.

In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns.

Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional manga [[written]] and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in [[2002]]. [[The]] [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation. This series was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Dear+ in 2002. It has been licensed by Taifu Comics.","[[Kio]] wa Ina Mono [[Mynōa]] Mono or also known as Koiha Ina Mono [[ouna]] Mono ([[恋はな異もの妙なもの]], trans.

"[[The]] Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] ([[also]] known as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large [[concrete]] [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between [[Hoboken]], New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake [[Hopatcong]] in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling [[gradient]] (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the [[Erie]] Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's [[conveyance]] into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the [[line]] in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes.

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10. The club has a new sponsor with Hunter Medical Research Institute. The Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. The Newcastle Jets announced with the FFA and the State Government, that they would host the Los Angeles Galaxy at Energy Australia Stadium on 27 November. The match, an almost certain sellout, will play host to big name players; David Beckham, and Landon Donovan.","The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[weason]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000.
