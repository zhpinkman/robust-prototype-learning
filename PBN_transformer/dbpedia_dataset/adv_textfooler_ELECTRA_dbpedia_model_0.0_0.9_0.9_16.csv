"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite.

"[[Martin]] [[Bruce]] [[Cameron]] ([[born]] 24 [[August]] 1936), [[Australian]] [[politician]], was a [[member]] of the Australian Senate and the South Australian Legislative [[Council]].

Cameron [[entered]] South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party.

[[After]] the 1973 [[Election]], the LCL (led at this [[stage]] by Bruce Eastick) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement members, such as future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown, decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron left with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only [[Liberal]] [[Movement]] member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 [[Election]] when he was [[joined]] by [[John]] Carnie. [[However]] the [[Liberal]] [[Movement]] was [[vastly]] outpolled by the LCL (renamed the Liberal [[Party]] of [[Australia]] in 1974), and there was a [[push]] from within both parties for reunification.

"[[Steven]] [[Lynn]] \""[[Steve]]\"" Beshear ([[born]] [[September]] 21, 1944) is an [[American]] [[attorney]] and [[Democratic]] [[Party]] [[politician]] who was the 61st [[Governor]] of [[Kentucky]] from 2007 to 2015. [[He]] [[served]] in the [[Kentucky]] [[House]] of [[Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the state's [[Attorney]] [[General]] from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] from 1983 to 1987. [[After]] [[graduating]] from the [[University]] of [[Kentucky]] [[College]] of [[Law]] in 1968, Beshear [[briefly]] [[practiced]] [[law]] in New [[York]] before [[returning]] to [[Kentucky]] and being [[elected]] to the [[state]] legislature, where he [[gained]] a [[reputation]] as a [[consumer]] [[advocate]]. [[He]] parlayed that [[reputation]] into a [[term]] as [[attorney]] [[general]], [[serving]] under [[Governor]] [[John]] [[Y]]. [[Brown]], [[Jr]]. [[As]] [[attorney]] [[general]], Beshear [[issued]] an [[opinion]] that [[copies]] of the [[Ten]] [[Commandments]] would [[have]] to [[be]] [[removed]] from the walls of the state's [[classrooms]] in the [[wake]] of the U.S. [[Supreme]] Court's decision in Stone v.

In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. [[His]] most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's [[sparring]] with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into [[politics]] during this period was an [[unsuccessful]] challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under [[extended]] [[investigation]] by then-Attorney [[General]] [[Greg]] Stumbo, over [[violations]] of the state's [[merit]] [[system]]. [[In]] the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to [[expand]] casino gambling as a [[means]] of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election.
