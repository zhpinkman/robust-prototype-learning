"[[The]] [[Raid]] on Griessie was a [[British]] attack on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed [[Gresik]]) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. [[The]] [[raid]] was the final [[action]] in a series of [[engagements]] fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the [[scuttling]] of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal [[Javan]] port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging [[Pellew]] to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hartsinck]] had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at [[Griessie]], near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, [[Cowell]] had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on [[Madura]]. With the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated. British forces returned to the region in 1810 with a large scale expeditionary force that successfully invaded and captured Java in 1811, temporary removing the last Dutch colony east of Africa.","[[Te]] [[Raiԁ]] on Griessie was a [[Britisհ]] attack on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed [[Greisk]]) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before [[disbanding]]. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ₪3.8 billion (approx. US $1.1 billion), the project was criticized for budget overruns, for its route serving Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem and for contributing to air and noise pollution during construction. The Green line's plans have been approved by the city of Jerusalem, with tenders to be issued soon, and the approval process has started on the Blue line.","The Jerusalem Light Rail (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light [[raiⅼ]] system in Jerusalem.

The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The [[line]] is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route.

Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h).

"[[The]] [[Word]] is an [[American]] instrumental/sacred steel/[[gospel]] [[blues]] jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes [[well-known]] musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi [[Allstars-]] Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, [[washboard]]), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by [[Arhoolie]] Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that [[often]] accompanies such music in the [[original]] [[church]] setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric [[washboard]] on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.","The [[Batte]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off ([[also]] [[known]] as the New [[Jersey]] Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered [[high-speed]] travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the [[roadbed]] required the [[movement]] of millions of tons of [[fill]] material using [[techniques]] similar to those [[used]] on the Panama [[Canal]].

Conrail ceased [[operation]] of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in [[1983]], citing its excess east-west [[routes]].

"Turkey, whose [[relations]] with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President [[Bashar]] [[Assad]] over the violent [[crackdown]] on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar [[Assad's]] father Hafez [[al-Assad]] expelled Kurdish leader [[Abdullah]] Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, [[Turkey]] trained [[defectors]] of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, [[Turkey]] began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the [[Kurdish-aligned]] forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian [[dissidents]]. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the [[Assad]] government's policies and has encouraged [[reconciliation]] [[among]] [[dissident]] factions.

Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the [[Kurdish-aligneԁ]] forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian [[dissidеnts]]. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the [[Assaԁ]] government's policies and has encouraged [[rеconciliation]] [[aｍong]] [[disident]] factions. [[Turkisհ]] President [[Rcep]] [[Tayy]] [[ip]] Erdoğan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in [[My]] 2012, some Syrian [[opposi𝚝ion]] fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation. [[Tur𝒌ey]] maintains a small enclave [[wi𝚝hin]] Syria itself, the Tomb of [[Suleyｍan]] [[Sahh]] on the right bank of the [[Euphratеs]] in Aleppo Province, near the village of [[Qaraհ]] Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 [[mеn]] in total. [[Folloԝing]] the [[inciden𝚝]], the [[Turkisհ]] [[governmet]] doubled the [[ոumber]] of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime [[Minist]] [[er]] Erdoğan [[warneԁ]] that \""the tomb of [[Suleyｍan]] Shah and the land that surrounds it are [[Turksih]] [[territorу]]. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and [[NA]] [[TO]] territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",5

It was organized by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and by local Albanian leaders against the Serbian capture of the regions of Ohrid, Debar and Struga after the Balkan Wars. The rebellion started only two months after the end of the Second Balkan War. The Albanian government organised armed resistance and 6,000 Albanians under the command of Isa Boletini, the Minister of War, crossed the frontier. After an engagement with the Serbians the forces took Debar and then marched, together with a Bulgarian band led by Petar Chaoulev, Milan Matov and Pavel Hristov expelled the Serbian army and officials, creating a front line 15 km east of Ohrid. However, another band was checked with loss at Mavrovo. Within a few days they captured the towns of Gostivar, Struga and Ohrid, expelling the Serbian troops. At Ohrid they set up a local government and held the hills towards Resen for four days. After a fortnight of fierce fighting, a Serbian army of 100,[[000]] regulars suppressed the uprising.

"[[Faxinalipterus]] is a [[genus]] of [[vertebrate]], [[possibly]] a [[pterosaur]], from the Late [[Triassic]] [[Caturrita]] [[Formation]] of [[southern]] [[Brazil]]. [[The]] [[type]] [[species]], [[Faxinalipterus]] [[minima]] was [[named]] and [[described]] in [[2010]] by José Fernando [[Bonaparte]], [[Marina]] [[Bento]] Soares and [[César]] [[Leandro]] [[Schultz]]. [[The]] [[generic]] [[name]] is derived from [[Faxinal]] do [[Soturno]] and a Latinised Greek [[pteron]], \""[[wing]]\"". [[The]] [[specific]] [[name]], from Latin [[minimus]], [[means]] \""smallest\"".

[[The]] [[holotype]], UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the collection of the [[Universidade]] Federal do [[Rio]] Grande do Sul and consists of several, [[partially]] fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a [[single]] [[individual]]. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper [[jaw]] fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. Faxinalipterus is a [[rather]] small animal, with an [[estimated]] [[total]] humerus length of [[eighteen]] [[millimetres]]. [[The]] size has been compared to that of a [[sparrow]]. [[The]] [[hind]] limbs, [[much]] [[better]] conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and [[lightly]] built with [[large]] openings. The maxillary [[teeth]], probably [[numbering]] eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its [[long]] [[hollow]] limbs and saddle-shaped [[upper]] joint of the [[relatively]] short and [[robust]] humerus, suitable to perform a [[wing]] [[stroke]]. They see it as perhaps the oldest [[pterosaur]] known, as it possibly predates [[European]] finds from the [[Norian]]. That the [[possible]] [[age]] difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of [[rapid]] evolution in early pterosaurs.

They [[also]] [[concluded]] Faxinalipterus is the most [[basal]] [[known]] [[pterosaur]], [[basal]] features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a [[thin]] radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the [[scapula]]. However, Alexander Kellner has [[suggested]] Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira.

However, his support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives, and Tea Party candidate Marco Rubio, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, surged in the polls. In April 2010, Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent.

Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress.

"The [[Raving]] [[Loony]] Green Giant [[Party]] was a [[political]] [[party]] in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1989 by former members of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party ([[OMRLP]]) after clashes between them and other members of the party over direction and party activities – in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley [[by-election]], 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many [[OMRLP]] candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the [[OMRLP]] – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. The party became effectively defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the OMRLP. It has not stood any candidates for a number of years and is not registered with the Electoral Commission. Hughes officially joined the Conservative Party just before the [[United]] Kingdom local elections, 1997.","The [[Ravіng]] [[Looոy]] Green Giant [[Par𝚝y]] was a [[politicaⅼ]] [[par𝚝y]] in the United Kingdom.

The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley [[bу-election]], 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many [[OM]] [[RLP]] candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the [[OMLRP]] – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so. The party became effectively defunct after Hughes's election to Devon County Council in 1993 and the defection of Danny Bamford (aka Danny Blue) back to the OMRLP. It has not stood any candidates for a number of years and is not registered with the Electoral Commission. Hughes officially joined the Conservative Party just before the [[Uni]] [[ted]] Kingdom local elections, 1997.",0

The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debré's government had started with the [[anti-colonialist]] National Liberation Front ([[FLN]]). [[General]] Raoul Salan [[stated]] that he joined the [[coup]] without [[concerning]] himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been [[considered]] a [[four-man]] coup [[d'état]], or as de Gaulle famously put it, \""un quarteron de généraux en [[retraite]]\"" (a handful of retired generals / generals in retreat). The [[coup]] was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French [[Algeria's]] major cities Algiers, [[Oran]] and Constantine, followed by the seizure of Paris. The metropolitan operation would be led by Colonel [[Antoine]] Argoud, with [[French]] [[paratroopers]] [[descending]] on strategic airfields. [[The]] commanders in [[Oran]] and [[Constantine]], [[however]], [[refused]] to [[follow]] Challe's [[demand]] that they [[join]] the [[coup]]. [[At]] the same [[time]], information about the [[metropolitan]] phase came to [[Prime]] Minister [[Debré's]] attention through the intelligence service. On 22 April, all flights and landings were [[forbidden]] in Parisian airfields, and an [[order]] was [[given]] to the army to resist the coup \""by all means\"". [[The]] [[following]] [[day]], [[President]] [[Charles]] de [[Gaulle]] made a [[famous]] [[speech]] on [[television]], [[dressed]] with his [[1940s]] [[general's]] uniform (he was [[70]] [[years]] old and [[long]] retired from the [[army]]) [[ordering]] the French [[people]] and army to help him.","The [[Algierѕ]] putsch (French: Putsch [[ԁ'Alger]] or [[Cop]] [[ԁ'État]] [[d'lAger]]), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des généraux), was a failed [[ϲoup]] d'état to overthrow French President Charles de Gaulle and establish a military junta.

"[[The]] [[1998]] FIFA World Cup [[Final]] was a [[football]] [[match]] that was played on [[12]] [[July]] 1998 at the [[Stade]] [[de]] France in Saint-Denis to determine the winner of the [[1998]] [[FIFA]] World Cup. [[The]] final was contested by Brazil, who were the [[defending]] champions having won the [[previous]] FIFA [[World]] [[Cup]] four years earlier in 1994, and the [[host]] [[nation]] France, who had reached the final of the tournament for the [[first]] [[time]].France won the [[match]] [[3]]–0 to claim the World Cup for the first time, with the timing of the [[match]] [[two]] days before [[Bastille]] Day adding to the significance of the [[victory]]. Zinedine Zidane, who was named man of the [[match]], scored twice before half-time and Emmanuel Petit added a [[third]] goal in the last minute. [[The]] match had an attendance in the region of 75,000. On their way to the [[final]], [[defending]] champions Brazil, coached by their former player Mário [[Zagallo]], [[recorded]] victories over Scotland ([[2]]–1) and [[Morocco]] ([[3]]–0) to top their group with 6 points from three matches, suffering a [[surprise]] 2–1 defeat at the hands of Norway in their final group game. After a 4–1 win over Chile and a [[3]]–2 success against Denmark, they reached the final with a penalty [[shoot-out]] victory over the Netherlands. As for France, they won their three [[group]] matches and defeated Paraguay in the [[knockout]] stages on [[golden]] goals. They had a penalty-shootout with Italy in the quarter-finals, and [[defeated]] [[recently]] [[formed]] Croatia to reach the final. The [[match]] [[also]] [[saw]] speculation on the condition of the Brazilian [[striker]] Ronaldo, who suffered a [[convulsive]] fit on the eve of the [[match]]. [[After]] initially being left out of the team sheet, in spite of his [[physical]] state, it was announced just 72 minutes before kick-off that he was going to play. In the match, he sustained an injury in a clash with [[French]] goalkeeper [[Fabien]] Barthez. Although it was believed that the decision to [[play]] Ronaldo had backfired, it was understandable as the player had been a [[crucial]] member of the [[side]] throughout the tournament, having [[scored]] [[four]] goals and [[created]] three more. [[France]] followed up their victory by qualifying for and winning UEFA [[Euro]] [[2000]] held in the Netherlands and [[Belgium]]. [[Brazil]] took the Copa [[America]] title in 1999, and then won the [[next]] [[FIFA]] [[World]] Cup in Japan and [[South]] Korea in 2002. [[Ronaldo]] went on to set the record for goals in [[World]] Cups, which was later broken by Miroslav Klose of Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. For Brazil, this marked only the second time that they had lost a World Cup final, following their 2–1 upset loss to Uruguay in the de facto final of the 1950 FIFA World Cup.

"The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late [[15th-century]] morality [[play]]. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The [[play]] is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him.

"The Bavarian People's [[Party]] ([[German]]: [[Bayerische]] [[Volkspartei]]; BVP) was the [[Bavarian]] [[branch]] of the [[Centre]] [[Party]], a lay [[Roman]] [[Catholic]] [[party]], which [[broke]] off from the rest of the [[party]] in 1918 to pursue a more [[conservative]], more [[Bavarian]] particularist course. The [[party]] displayed [[monarchist]] [[leanings]] (because [[many]] Bavarians had never accepted the overthrow of the House of Wittelsbach in 1918) and there was a period of near [[separatism]] in the [[early]] [[1920s]], culminating in Gustav von [[Kahr's]] unwillingness to abide by rulings from Berlin during the autumn crisis of [[1923]].

"[[Wing-Man]] (Japanese: [[ウイングマン]] Hepburn: Uinguman) is a Japanese [[science]] fiction [[manga]] [[series]] [[written]] and [[illustrated]] by [[Masakazu]] [[Katsura]]. [[It]] was [[serialized]] in [[Weekly]] Shōnen [[Jump]] from [[1983]] to [[1985]], with the [[chapters]] [[collected]] into 13 tankōbon [[volumes]] by [[Shueisha]]. [[Wing-Man]] is the [[story]] of [[Kenta]] Hirano, a fan of [[superheroes]] and sentai television [[shows]] to the point where he dreams of becoming such a hero himself. To that end, he creates a superhero of his own called \""[[Wingman]],\"" and, [[much]] to the chagrin of his teachers, [[acts]] out his [[fantasies]] of being Wingman at school. When [[Kenta]] [[meets]] [[Aoi]] [[Yume]], the [[beautiful]] [[blue-haired]] princess of an [[alternate]] [[universe]] called Podreams, he gets his chance to make his fantasy [[come]] true, as [[Aoi]] carries a book called a [[Dream]] Note which can make any dream [[come]] true, and [[Kenta]] draws a picture of Wingman in the book, allowing him to become Wingman for [[real]]. [[Kenta]], Aoi and [[Kenta's]] classmate and [[love]] [[interest]], [[Miku]] [[Ogawa]], team up to [[save]] Podreams from the evil dictator Rimel, who wants to use the Dream Note to take over Podreams, while [[Kenta]] deals with his [[conflicting]] feelings for both of his [[female]] compatriots. [[The]] manga was adapted into an anime television [[series]] [[titled]] Dream [[Soldier]] [[Wing-Man]] ([[夢戦士ウイングマン]] Yume Senshi [[Uinguman]]) in [[1984]]. It also had a 1984 [[visual]] novel adventure game adaptation of the same name, [[developed]] by TamTam and [[published]] by Enix for the NEC PC-8801 and other Japanese personal [[computers]].

"[[The]] Arab–Khazar [[wars]] were a [[series]] of [[conflicts]] fought between the armies of the Khazar Khaganate and the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate (as well as its [[Abbasid]] successor) and their respective vassals. Historians usually distinguish [[two]] [[major]] periods of conflict, the [[First]] (сa. 642–652) and Second (ca. 722–[[737]]) Arab–Khazar Wars, but the Arab–[[Khazar]] military confrontation involved [[several]] [[sporadic]] raids and isolated clashes as well, over a period from the middle of the [[7th]] century to the end of the 8th century. [[The]] Arab–Khazar wars were a result of the attempts of the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate to secure control of Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, where the [[Khazars]] were already [[established]]. [[The]] first [[Arab]] invasion, in the 640s and early 650s, ended with the defeat of an [[Arab]] force [[led]] by [[Abd]] ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah outside the Khazar town of [[Balanjar]]. Hostilities broke out again with the Caliphate in the 710s, with raids back and forth [[across]] the Caucasus. Led by the distinguished generals al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah and [[Maslama]] ibn Abd al-Malik, the [[Arabs]] were able to capture [[Derbent]] and even the [[southern]] Khazar capital of Balanjar, but this had little impact on the nomadic [[Khazars]], who remained [[able]] to [[launch]] devastating raids [[deep]] into Transcaucasia. In one such raid in [[730]], the [[Khazars]] inflicted a major defeat on the Umayyad [[forces]] at the [[Battle]] of Ardabil, killing al-Jarrah, but were in turn defeated the next year and pushed back north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab military outpost and colony, before being replaced by Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future caliph Marwan II) in 732. A period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737, when Marwan led north a massive expedition that reached the Khazar capital Atil on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the khagan, the Arabs withdrew. The 737 campaign marked the [[end]] of large-scale warfare between the two powers, establishing Derbent as the northernmost Muslim outpost and securing Muslim dominance over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the long wars weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the eventual fall of the dynasty to the Abbasid Revolution a few years later. Relations between the Muslims of the Caucasus and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure a marriage alliance between the Arab governors or local princes of the Caucasus and the Khazar khagan. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the local Muslim principalities of the Caucasus until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.","[[Tհe]] Arab–Khazar [[wɑrs]] were a [[s]] [[eries]] of [[conflictѕ]] fought between the armies of the Khazar Khaganate and the [[Umayyɑd]] Caliphate (as well as its [[Abbɑsid]] successor) and their respective vassals.

The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa, who had each won their semi-finals against France and Argentina respectively. The final was refereed by Irish referee Alain Rolland. The two finalists had met earlier in the competition, during the pool stage, when South Africa won 36–0, so South Africa began the final as the only undefeated team left in the competition. Had England won the competition, they would have become not only the first nation to retain the Rugby World Cup, which they had won in 2003, but the only team to win a final after having lost a game at the pool stage. Winners South Africa became the second country to win two titles, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999. The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson.

"[[Intelsat]] 5 (aka [[IS-5]], [[PAS-5]] and [[Arabsat]] 2C) was a [[satellite]] [[providing]] television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. [[It]] was manufactured by Aeronutronics. [[At]] beginning of [[life]], it [[generates]] [[nearly]] 10 kilowatts. [[This]] [[version]] [[takes]] [[advantage]] of such [[advances]] as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar [[cells]], new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion [[propulsion]] system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's [[first]] customer to [[launch]] the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the [[satellite]] was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat).

"Ah Pook Is Here was a collaboration between author William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm Mc Neill. [[It]] began in 1970, when Burroughs was living in London and Mc Neill was in his final year of art school. It first appeared under the title The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the [[English]] Cyclops. When that [[magazine]] [[ceased]] [[publication]], Burroughs and Mc Neill decided to develop the concept as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 pages to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco agreed to publish the proposed work in 1971 as a \""Word/Image novel\"" which was to comprise 120 [[pages]], some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. [[However]], the small advance proffered by the publisher made any more than a few months of working full-time on the project [[impossible]], and when [[Straight]] [[Arrow]] [[closed]] in [[1974]] the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, Mc Neill moved to [[New]] York in 1975 to rejoin [[Burroughs]] and continue the work. They were [[unable]] to [[find]] [[another]] publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally [[abandoned]]. [[It]] was [[subsequently]] [[published]] in 1979 (by John Calder and Viking Penguin) in [[text]] form only under the [[original]] title of Ah [[Pook]] Is [[Here]].
