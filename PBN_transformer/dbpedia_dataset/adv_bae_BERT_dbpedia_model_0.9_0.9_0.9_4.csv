"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia [[architect]] Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before [[transferring]] to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several [[buildings]] at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway [[Theatre]] in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis [[Theater]] in Vineland, New Jersey.

"[[The]] Lackawanna Cut-Off ([[also]] known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] ([[DL]]&[[W]]) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was [[considered]] a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","[[the]] Lackawanna Cut-Off ([[informally]] known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[company]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[railroads]] ([[lc]]&[[ed]]) between 1908 and 1911.

"Turkey, [[whose]] relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence.

"[[The]] Reform movement was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system.

"The SM [[Kirov]] Stadium was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The stadium was named after Sergey Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place.

"The 2004 Virginia Tech Hokies football [[represented]] [[represented]] the Virginia Tech in the 2004 NCAA Division [[I-A]] football [[season]]. Virginia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in its inaugural year in the conference, running off a streak of eight straight wins to end the regular season after a 2–2 start. Tech finished 10th in the final Associated Press poll with a 10–3 record. The team's head coach was Frank Beamer, who was named ACC Coach of the Year. Virginia Tech began the season unranked nationally, having suffered a meltdown at the end of the 2003 season. The Hokies faced a daunting schedule, beginning with a nationally-televisioned game against the defending national co-champion USC Trojans. That game, known as the BCA Classic, was the first NCAA college football game of the year, and would be followed by a tough conference schedule. Tech lost to eventual BCS National Champion USC at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, 24-13, losing the lead late in the third quarter. After a 63-0 shellacking of Western Michigan, Tech played its first ever ACC game on September 18, against Duke. Tech prevailed 41-17 in Lane Stadium. The Hokies dropped to 2-2 following a 17-16 home loss to N.C. State, in which the Hokies missed a would-be winning field goal as time expired. The team then needed to win five of its next eight games to extend its 11-season streak of playing in a post-season bowl game. After reeling off three-straight wins, including a 19-13 squeaker over then #7 West Virginia, the Hokies' fortunes looked bleak in the fourth quarter of their game against Georgia Tech in Atlanta on ESPN Thursday night college football. Tech was down 14-0 at one point and trailed 20-12 with 5:28 left in the fourth quarter. Tech racked up 22 unanswered points to exterminate the Yellow Jackets. Tech would go on to win their remaining regular-season games, including a 24-10 win over then #16 Virginia in Lane Stadium and a 16-10 away victory over then #9 Miami, to clinch the ACC Championship. As ACC Champions, Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2005 Sugar Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game in New Orleans, Louisiana. Virginia Tech faced Auburn, a team that had gone undefeated in the regular season but was denied a bid to the national championship game by virtue of its lower rank in the BCS poll. In a game that was not decided until the final two minutes, Virginia Tech lost to Auburn 16-13. Tech was led by quarterback Bryan Randall during the season.

Under the FCC Table of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, WNZR, also operates at 90.9 MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential.

Under the FCC Table of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, WNZR, also operates at 90.9 MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential. Students share the administrative duties of running the station with a [[dedicated]] adviser, currently John Finn, to oversee them. Herman Gibbs is the chief operator/engineer of WCWS, and has served in that role since 1984. Radio at the College of Wooster began back in the 1950s [[broadcast]] music and local programs as well as campus [[events]] in mono to the greater Wooster community. The 1980s saw the addition of a satellite dish to broadcast [[space]] [[opera]] programs on Saturday afternoons. During the [[faculty]] year 1984/85 WCWS went stereo for the first [[place]] under the leadership of Gibbs as well as [[staff]] managers [[dan]] Garan and Kenyon Mau. Further [[alterations]] came in latter years, including the frequency [[alterations]] from 91.9 to 90.9 FM. For the [[detailed]] history of WCWS, please see WOO 91 Station [[archives]]. [[during]] 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian radio [[project]], [[represented]] WCWS and other radio stations during the FCC [[registration]] renewal process. Due to the efforts of the [[home]] of Wooster administration, [[herman]] Gibbs, John Finn, and the [[students]] management, the FCC [[mounted]] the challenge in May 2005. During the fight for their station, a [[distinct]] station identity, WOO 91, was created, and a [[redesigned]] logo was designed to fit the new image. [[within]] addition, student management worked with their DJs to [[design]] a more professional-sounding [[stations]], and in November 2004, WCWS broadcast live election coverage for Wayne [[sburg]], which was well received. In August 2005, WCWS became the Wooster community's only commercial-free [[facility]] to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a [[year]]. [[over]] early 2012, WCWS was invited to join the iHeartRadio network, allowing [[patrons]] to stream the station's broadcasts online or with a mobile app. [[up]] the [[course]] of 2013, WCWS moved out of Wishart [[building]] to Lowry [[centre]], Wooster’s student center, [[extending]] the visibility of the station on the college's [[site]].",0

"No. 51 Squadron RAF [[Regiment]] is a field [[squadron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air [[Force]]. [[Its]] mission is [[protection]] of RAF bases from ground attack. [[The]] history of No. 51 [[Squadron]] goes back to 1947 when it was formed at RAF Celle near the [[Lüneburg]] Heath in Germany by the redesignation of [[No]]. 2713 Squadron RAF Regiment. [[Its]] initial role was as a rifle squadron, protecting RAF facilities from ground [[attack]]. In 1955 it changed to the light anti-aircraft role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. [[In]] [[1964]] the squadron reformed, switching back to the rifle [[role]], at the RAF Regiment Depot. [[The]] first assignments of the [[unit]] after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and [[Aden]] where it undertook internal security roles. After Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965 it was [[sent]] to [[Africa]] to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. [[After]] [[returning]] to Catterick the unit's next deployment was back to Aden in the immediate period before the British withdrawal from there in 1967. Its service in Aden was mainly spent at the many isolated airfields dotting that colony. In 1968 the squadron shifted bases with a move to RAF Wittering. This move was undertaken to support the Hawker Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming operational. With the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, No. 51 Squadron deployed to the province, a process which it would repeat at regular intervals for the next 18 years. This period also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and Hong Kong. In 1982 the squadron moved back to Catterick from Wittering to re-role. It emerged operating the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked) family and in wartime it would have moved to Germany to defend airfields there. However its next war service was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. In aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the squadron deployed to Arabia and detachments saw service at Dharan, Muharraq and Tabuk during the war. Following the Options for Change defence cuts the squadron was disbanded in 1993. The dawn of a new century saw a return to active service for the squadron. Once again operating in a field squadron role, it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before moving to RAF Lossiemouth.

"Emil Shimoun Nona (born November 1, 1967) is the [[Archbishop]] of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, prior to this he has been the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in the northern part of Iraq since the consent of Pope Benedict XVI to his election on 13 November 2009. He took over the archeparchy after the murder of Paulos Faraj Rahho in early 2008. Nona, an ethnic Assyrian, was born in Alqosh in 1967. After completing his secondary education in 1985, he entered the Chaldean Patriarchal Seminary and was ordained priest on 11 January 1991 in Baghdad. From 1993 to 1997 he was parochial vicar at Alqosh, then pastor until 2000. He then enrolled at the Pontifical Lateran University. In 2005 he obtained a doctorate in theology and returned home. From 2005 he served as a professor of anthropology at the Babel College. Later, he was named vicar general of the Chaldean Catholic eparchy (diocese) of Alqosh. He speaks Syriac, Arabic, Italian, and knows English. On May 5, 2009, the Synod of Bishops of the Chaldean Catholic Church elected Nona archeparch of Mosul of the Chaldeans. Pope Benedict XVI gave his consent to Nona's election on November 13, 2009. He was ordained a bishop on 8 January 2010, with Mar Emmanuel III Delly, patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans, as principal consecrator. At the age of 42, he was the youngest Catholic archbishop in the world. Speaking on the violence in Iraq in 2014 Archeparch Nona said, all the Christians who were still living there have now fled. Nona, corroborated this while speaking with the worldwide Catholic relief service Aid to the Church in Need. “All the faithful have left the city. Who knows whether they will ever be able to return,” Abp. Nona said. “In 2003 there were still 35,000 faithful living in Mosul. Three thousand were still there in early 2014. Now probably not one is left here, and that is tragic,” the Archbishop declared. The city of Mosul, with a population of three million, was already mentioned in the Bible as Nineveh, and for thousands of years it has been a place of Christian civilisation. Archbishop Nona reported on the capture of Mosul: “We have never experienced anything like it before. A major city like Mosul has fallen victim to chaos.” The fighting, he said, began on Thursday, June 5; at first, however, it was limited to several districts in the western part of the city. “The army began to bombard the areas that were affected, but then the armed forces and the police suddenly left Mosul during the night between Monday and Tuesday, leaving the city at the mercy of the aggressors.” More than half of the inhabitants and the entire Christian community immediately fled to the nearby Nineveh Plain. “At around 5:00 on Tuesday morning we took in the families of refugees and tried to lodge them in schools, catechism classrooms and abandoned houses,” Nona reported.","Emil Shimoun Nona (born November 1, 1967) is the [[diocese]] of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, prior to this he has been the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in the northern part of Iraq since the consent of Pope Benedict XVI to his election on 13 November 2009.

"Canby Area [[Transit]], or simply CAT, is the public transit [[bus]] service provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon. As of 2015, it [[operates]] one fixed route between Woodburn, Canby and Oregon City along Oregon Route 99E, complementary paratransit, and a dial-a-ride service within the city of Canby. It has a hub at the downtown Canby Transit Center. CAT was established as a department of the City of Canby on January 1, 2002 upon Canby's withdrawal from the TriMet service area, and had an official dedication on August 20, 2002. Canby paid TriMet to continue service in the interim, and replaced TriMet's commuter runs in 2004, which received little ridership at the end. CAT also expanded service within the city of Canby, to Woodburn and to Wilsonville, the latter in partnership with Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit. Canby replaced TriMet's payroll tax with its own within the city, but at a somewhat lower rate, and also receives state and federal grants. Due to the loss of state tax credits and recession-caused tax revenue decreases, CAT had to eliminate Saturday service, fixed-route service within Canby and trips to Wilsonville, as well as started charging a $1 fare. In exchange, they started to allow the general public to use dial-a-ride service within Canby that was previously limited to eligible disabled riders, and SMART continued to operate its trips from Wilsonville.","Canby Area [[hub]], or simply CAT, is the public transit [[transportation]] service provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a [[satellite]] [[providing]] television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by.

"Soto Cano Air [[Base]] (commonly known as Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military base 5 mi (8.0 km) to the south of Comayagua in Honduras.

Kikkia's name is given as the second of a [[group]] of rulers “(named) on bricks whose eponyms are not found\"", suggesting that he had preceded the period in which the annually-elected limmu officials had been appointed and given their names to the years. Consequently, the length of his reign is undetermined. Apart from his appearance in two copies of the Assyrian King List (the Khorsabad and SDAS copies, but not the Nassouhi one which is damaged at the top where he might have appeared), he is only known from two building [[inscriptions]] of his successors, moreover; the earliest of these is that of Ashur-rim-nisheshu (c. 1398 BC — c. 1391 [[BC]]), who [[commemorated]] his reconstruction of the wall of the inner-city of Assur by listing the previous restorers on a [[commemorative]] cone, (beginning with Kikkia.) The later king, Shalmaneser II, restored this wall and gave credit to his predecessor in his inscription. The erection of a defensive wall suggests that Kikkia may have won his independence from the waning influence of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. An earlier Assyrian šakkanakkum (KIŠ.NITA2) and chief magistrate of Assur, Zariqum, who had been omitted from the extant copies of the Assyrian King Lists, had been a contemporary and vassal of Shulgi (c. 2029 BC — c. 1982 BC) and of Amar-Sin of Ur (c. 1981 BC — c. 1973 BC), so one would suppose that Kikkia must have reigned after this time. Arthur Ungnad interpreted Kikkia's name, and that of Ushpia, as being that of the Hurrian language (BA VI, 5, S. 13), but more recent research no longer holds this thesis as tenable, and Arno Poebel was not convinced by the interpretation.","Kikkia (sometimes given as Kikkiya), inscribed mKi-ik-ki-a had been the twenty-eighth ruler of Assyria to be recorded within the Assyrian King List.

The Republicans had a plurality in both chambers, with 24 members in the Senate and 69 in the House, but control of the chambers was held by a coalition of Democrats, third parties, and independents. The third parties represented in this session included the Opposition Party, the Independent Reform Party, and the Democratic Liberal Party, which took many of its members (including its leader, former governor John M.

"Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[center]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered. Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, founder of Still Mind Zendo, has been a Zen teacher since 2000 prior to which she was in private practice as a spiritual director for 15 years, also working as a community organizer and peace activist. She is married to Sensei Gregory Abels and they are the parents of a grown daughter. Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels is co-resident teacher at Still Mind Zendo. As well as being a Zen teacher, he has enjoyed a 50 year career as an actor, theatre director and Master Teacher of Acting and is also a poet, his writing being informed by his Zen practice.

"New-York Central [[College]], McGrawville was an institution of higher learning [[founded]] by Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor and other anti-slavery Baptists in 1849 in McGraw, New York.

In addition to the African-Americans in the student body, at least two of the school's faculty were black as well.

"Habibi (foaled 4 September 2009) is a New Zealand thoroughbred [[racehorse]]. She is most noted for winning the 2013 New Zealand Derby; one of only five fillies since 1980 to achieve this feat. She is trained by Donna and Dean Logan. Habibi made her raceday debut in October 2012, winning at her home track of Ruakaka. Wins at Avondale and Ellerslie followed, before she was asked to take on the top male three-year-olds over the Ellerslie Christmas Carnival. This decision proved successful, with Habibi easily winning both the Great Northern Guineas on Boxing Day and the Championship Stakes on New Year's Day. These wins made her unbeaten in five starts, and saw her become a clear favourite for the New Zealand Derby. A solid run for third in the Avondale Guineas was her only subsequent lead-up run to the Derby. In the Derby, she started from the inside barrier, settled four-back on the rail before getting clear in the straight and running down another filly, Fix, for a half-length win. The victory gave rider Vinnie Colgan his fifth success in the New Zealand Derby, the most of any rider since the race was moved to Ellerslie in 1973.","Habibi (foaled 4 September 2009) is a New Zealand thoroughbred [[race]].

Channel 4 is currently occupied by Pitbull's Globalization Radio. Both the 40s Junction name and the channel's longtime nickname, \""The Savoy Express\"", refer to the passenger train travel common in the 1940s. It also refers to the popular 1941 jazz song Chattanooga Choo Choo. The original \""Station Master\"" (Program Director) for the channel was Marlin Taylor, with Bob Moke as Music Director. Both have since departed, and the channel is currently programmed by Human Newman. The voice of the channel is Lou Brutus, who models his announcing style after that of Bing Crosby staff announcer Ken Carpenter. In keeping with the railroad theme, the channel's logo now features a train itself.",0

"The [[Army]] of the Danube (French: Armée du Danube) was a field [[army]] of the French Directory in the 1799 southwestern campaign in the Upper Danube valley. It was [[formed]] on 2 March 1799 by the simple expedient of renaming the Army of Observation, which had been observing Austrian movements on the border between French First Republic and the [[Holy]] [[Roman]] [[Empire]]. It was commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Comte Jourdan (1762–1833). The [[formation]] of the army was part of the French Directory's long term strategy to undermine [[Habsburg]] influence in the Holy Roman Empire, and, conversely, to [[strengthen]] [[French]] hegemony in central Europe after the [[wars]] of the First Coalition and the Treaty of Campo [[Formio]] in 1797. [[Despite]] the Treaty, Austria and France remained suspicious of each other's [[motives]], and the purpose of the Army of the Observation was to watch for Austrian border [[transgressions]]. Understanding that the negotiations at the Congress of Rastatt were [[going]] no-where, the Army of Observation was [[instructed]] to cross the Rhine. Once across the Rhine, the [[Army]] of the Danube, was to secure strategic [[positions]] in southwestern Germany ([[present]] day Baden-Württemberg) and engage Archduke Charles' Austrian army. In the [[meantime]], the Army of Helvetia, under command of André [[Masséna]], would secure such strategic [[locations]] as St. Gotthard [[Pass]], the Swiss Plateau, and [[upper]] Rhine basin.

After reorganization, in which elements of the army were combined with [[Massena's]] Army of Switzerland, it withdrew after an engagement with Charles' superior force at Zürich in early June 1799; only in the Second Battle of Zurich did the Army of the Danube secure an uncontested victory.
