"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","[[O’∏]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[ùöèixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season.

"[[Kenneth]] Eugene Harvey ([[born]] March 1, 1978) is a [[former]] Major League baseball first baseman. Harvey played his rookie season in Kansas City in 2003. After an impressive first half of the 2004 season, featuring an early battle with Baltimore Orioles Melvin Mora for the AL lead in batting average, Harvey was selected as the Royals' lone representative in the All-Star Game. In interleague play with no designated hitter, the Royals played Harvey in left field in order to keep both Harvey and 1B/DH Mike Sweeney, their two most productive bats, in the lineup.

Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ‚Ç™3.8 billion (approx. US $1.1 billion), the project was criticized for budget overruns, for its route serving Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem and for contributing to air and noise pollution during construction. The Green line's plans have been approved by the city of Jerusalem, with tenders to be issued soon, and the approval process has started on the Blue line.","The Jerusalem Light Rail (Hebrew: ◊î◊®◊õ◊ë◊™ ◊î◊ß◊ú◊î ◊ë◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù‚Äé‚Äé, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail [[sys]] [[tem]] in Jerusalem.

After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ‚Ç™3.8 billion (approx. US $1.1 billion), the project was criticized for budget overruns, for its route serving Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem and for contributing to air and noise pollution during construction. The Green line's plans have been approved by the city of Jerusalem, with tenders to be issued soon, and the approval process has started on the Blue line.",0

"[[The]] [[Caravan]] raids refer to a series of raids in which the Islamic prophet Muhammed and his companions [[participated]]. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of caravans financed by the Quraysh.

The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.

The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.","The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[b…ënd]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar.

It was founded 2005 by Hobby Star Marketing Inc. It is traditionally a three-day event (Friday through Sunday) but expanded to four days (Thursday through Sunday) in 2011. It is typically held the weekend before Labour Day during the summer in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Originally [[sh–æwcasing]] collectable card games, role playing games/fantasy and some film/television and related popular arts, the convention has expanded over the years to include a larger range of pop culture elements, such as Collectible miniatures games, board games, video games and web entertainment. The Fan Expo Canada convention which GX is a part of is the largest of its kind in Canada and among the largest in world, filling the entire North building of the Metro Toronto Convention [[Cent‚≤Öe]] with over 79,000 attendees in 2011.

"The [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when ·∏™attusili III ousted his nephew Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub and seized the [[Hittite]] throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of ·∏™anigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with ·∏™atti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tud·∏´alia IV, ·∏™attusili's son and successor. [[This]] led to a major [[battle]] which is known today as the [[Battle]] of [[Ni·∏´riya]]. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-a≈°ared.

"[[Frederick]] [[Charles]] 'Fred' Keenor (31 [[July]] 1894 ‚Äì [[November]] [[1972]]) was a [[Welsh]] professional [[footballer]] and [[Wales]] international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial [[match]] in [[1912]] that was [[organised]] by his [[former]] schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the [[team]] in the [[Southern]] Football League before his [[spell]] at the club was [[interrupted]] by the [[outbreak]] of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by [[Major]] Frank [[Buckley]]. [[During]] the conflict, he [[fought]] in the [[Battle]] of the [[Somme]], [[suffering]] a [[severe]] shrapnel [[wound]] to his [[thigh]] in 1916. [[After]] lengthy [[rehabilitation]], he [[returned]] to [[Britain]] and ended the [[war]] as a [[fitness]] instructor, [[reaching]] the [[rank]] of [[sergeant]]. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their [[history]], winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Sheffield United.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

He also held an African record of 55.[[04]] from the [[2002]] [[Telkom]] [[International]] [[Sprint]] [[Challenge]] that defeated Terence Parkin for a top finish and sliced off Brendon [[Dedekind's]] standard by [[0]].37 of a second. [[During]] his [[sporting]] [[career]], Verster [[trained]] [[full-time]] for the [[Pietermaritzburg]] [[Seals]] Swim [[Club]] under his [[personal]] [[coach]] Wayne [[Riddin]]. [[Verster]] [[ascended]] to [[prominence]] in the global [[scene]] at the 1999 Pan [[Pacific]] Swimming Championships in Sydney, [[placing]] [[seventh]] each in the 100 m butterfly (54.28) and 200 m individual [[medley]] (2:04.24). On that same year, at the All-Africa [[Games]] in Johannesburg, [[Verster]] established meet records to claim [[two]] [[golds]] each in the 200 m butterfly ([[2]]:04.69) and in the [[200]] m individual [[medley]] (2:04.10). In the 100 m butterfly, he was [[upstaged]] by teammate Kelly on a [[head-to-head]] race, ending up only with a silver in 54.75. [[At]] the 2000 [[Summer]] [[Olympics]] in Sydney, [[Verster]] built a [[monstrous]] program of [[four]] [[swimming]] events. He posted [[FINA]] A-standards of 53.86 (100 m [[butterfly]]), [[2]]:01.63 (200 m butterfly), and 2:03.11 ([[200]] m individual [[medley]]) from the South [[African]] Championships in Johannesburg. On the third day of the [[Games]], Verster [[placed]] [[twenty-sixth]] in the [[200]] m butterfly. Swimming in heat three, he picked up a fourth [[seed]] by almost a full body length behind winner [[Vladan]] [[Markoviƒá]] of Yugoslavia in [[2]]:00.[[90]]. Two [[days]] later, in the 200 m individual [[medley]], [[Verster]] finished twentieth in 2:[[03]].64, [[nearly]] a small [[fraction]] of a [[second]] outside the semifinal field. In his final individual event, 100 m butterfly, [[Verster]] posted a [[time]] of 53.95 from heat five, but missed again the [[semifinals]] by 0.14 of a second with an eighteenth-place effort. [[Verster]] also teamed up with [[Simon]] Thirsk, Brett Petersen, and Nicholas [[Folker]] in the 4 √ó 100 m medley relay. Swimming a butterfly leg in heat [[two]], Verster recorded a split of 53.52, a national record, but the South Africans finished the race in fourth place and thirteenth overall with a final time of 3:42.44. Verster also sought his entry bid for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, but finished fourth in the 100 m butterfly (54.82) at the South African Championships, handing over to his teammate Eugene Botes. Shortly after the trials, Verster announced his retirement from swimming. He is currently working as a full-time coach for Saint Andrew's School for Girls in Johannesburg.","[[Theoph—ñlus]] \""Theo\"" [[Vesrter]] ([[–¨orn]] [[Janua‚≤Öy]] 14, [[197∆º]]) is a South African former [[swimme‚≤Ö]], who specialized in butterfly and in individual medley [[event—ï]].

He still held both Lincluden and [[Kirmahoe]] on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus retained his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II. In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.",0

"Laurie Fowler ([[born]] 29 [[December]] 1951) is a former [[Australian]] [[rules]] footballer who played for Richmond and Melbourne in the [[Victorian]] Football League (VFL). After [[finishing]] runner-up in the [[senior]] best and fairest count as a 16-year-old at Oakleigh [[Districts]], Fowler was zoned to Richmond.

[[The]] collision [[severely]] impacted Nicholls and helped Richmond avenge their loss to Carlton in the previous year's Grand [[Final]]. Richmond won the premiership again in 1974, but Fowler quit after he was omitted from the team. The Tigers [[considered]] Fowler's [[senior]] options to be limited and sold him to Melbourne, the club Fowler had supported as a child, for $15,000 (equivalent to over $100,000 in [[2009]]). Fowler made an instant impact with the [[struggling]] Demons, winning the [[Keith]] '[[Bluey']] Truscott Medal for the best and fairest player at the club in his first [[season]]. Although primarily a back-pocket [[player]], Melbourne coach Bob Skilton also used Fowler as a ruck-rover to help cover for [[Greg]] [[Wells']] lack of defensive skills in the midfield.

"Fred Warren Waters (February [[2]], [[1927]] ‚Äì August [[28]], [[1989]]) was an [[American]] [[professional]] baseball player, manager, scout and coach. [[The]] left-handed pitcher appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955‚Äì1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. [[Born]] in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the University of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949‚Äì58; 1960‚Äì62) [[pitching]] career in minor league [[baseball]]. He was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only [[six-for-one]] [[trade]] in Major League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. [[His]] first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4‚Äì0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama‚ÄìFlorida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41‚Äì13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681‚Äì664 (.505).

"No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment is a [[field]] squadron of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air Force. Its mission is protection of RAF bases from ground attack. The history of No. 51 Squadron goes back to 1947 when it was formed at RAF Celle near the L√ºneburg Heath in Germany by the redesignation of No. [[2713]] Squadron RAF Regiment. [[Its]] initial [[role]] was as a [[rifle]] [[squadron]], protecting RAF facilities from [[ground]] attack. In [[1955]] it [[changed]] to the light anti-aircraft role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. In [[1964]] the squadron reformed, switching back to the [[rifle]] role, at the RAF Regiment Depot. The first assignments of the unit after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook internal security roles. After [[Rhodesia]] [[unilaterally]] declared [[independence]] in [[1965]] it was sent to Africa to [[protect]] [[Gloster]] [[Javelin]] [[aircraft]] which were [[deployed]] in [[Zambia]]. [[After]] returning to Catterick the [[unit's]] next deployment was [[back]] to Aden in the immediate [[period]] before the [[British]] withdrawal from there in [[1967]]. [[Its]] service in [[Aden]] was [[mainly]] spent at the [[many]] [[isolated]] [[airfields]] [[dotting]] that [[colony]]. In [[1968]] the squadron [[shifted]] [[bases]] with a [[move]] to RAF Wittering. [[This]] move was [[undertaken]] to [[support]] the Hawker [[Siddeley]] Harrier [[force]] which was then [[becoming]] operational. [[With]] the start of the troubles in [[Northern]] Ireland in 1969, No. 51 Squadron deployed to the province, a process which it would [[repeat]] at regular intervals for the [[next]] 18 [[years]]. [[This]] period also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and [[Hong]] Kong. In [[1982]] the squadron moved [[back]] to Catterick from [[Wittering]] to [[re-role]]. It [[emerged]] [[operating]] the [[Combat]] [[Vehicle]] [[Reconnaissance]] ([[tracked]]) [[family]] and in wartime it [[would]] have moved to [[Germany]] to defend [[airfields]] there. [[However]] its next war [[service]] was not to be in Europe but in the Middle [[East]]. In aftermath of the [[Iraqi]] invasion of [[Kuwait]] the squadron deployed to Arabia and detachments saw [[service]] at Dharan, [[Muharraq]] and [[Tabuk]] during the [[war]]. [[Following]] the [[Options]] for Change [[defence]] cuts the squadron was [[disbanded]] in [[1993]]. [[The]] dawn of a [[new]] [[century]] saw a [[return]] to active service for the squadron. Once again operating in a [[field]] [[squadron]] [[role]], it reformed at RAF [[Honington]] in 2001 before moving to [[RAF]] [[Lossiemouth]]. It was not long before war [[beckoned]] again and the squadron was [[deployed]] in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

"DJ [[Boy]], also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up [[game]] partially [[based]] on the hip-hop [[culture]] of the U.S. cities.

Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller [[fighter]] gang known as the [[Dark]] Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various stages and [[utilizes]] hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the \""prizes\"" consist of coins that are dropped by [[defeated]] enemies, or [[food]] items like burgers that [[restore]] health.","DJ [[Bo—É]], also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up [[gaÔΩçe]] partially [[base‘Å]] on the hip-hop [[cultu‚≤Öe]] of the U.S. cities.

Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller [[fig’∞ter]] gang known as the [[Darùíå]] Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various stages and [[util—ñzes]] hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the \""prizes\"" consist of coins that are dropped by [[defe…ëted]] enemies, or [[fo–æd]] items like burgers that [[r–µstore]] health.",1

"Jerry Allen Walker ([[born]] February 12, 1939 in Ada, Oklahoma) is a former right-handed [[pitcher]] in American Major League Baseball who performed for the Baltimore Orioles, Kansas City Athletics and Cleveland Indians between 1957 and 1964. During his career, he stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 195 pounds (88 kg). He signed with Baltimore as a \""bonus baby\"" out of [[Ada's]] Byng High School on June 28, 1957. A member of the Orioles' fabled \""Kiddie Corps\"" of young pitchers signed in the late 1950s (others included Milt Pappas, Steve Barber and Chuck Estrada), Walker is one of a very few players to have gone straight to the Major Leagues without ever playing a game in the minor leagues. In his debut, on July 6, 1957, against the Boston Red Sox, he failed to retire a batter, issuing bases on balls to Mickey Vernon and Jackie Jensen, then uncorking a wild pitch. Walker then was lifted from the game, but both runners scored, giving Walker an earned run average of infinity coming out of his first MLB game. [[However]], he was consistently more [[effective]] as the season progressed, and threw a [[four-hit]], complete game shutout against the Washington Senators on September 4, [[beating]] Camilo [[Pascual]] 1‚Äì0 for his [[first]] [[big-league]] victory. He [[also]] became the youngest pitcher [[ever]] to start a [[Major]] League Baseball [[All-Star]] game when, at age 20, he went to mound for the American League in the [[second]] All-Star contest of 1959. Walker went three innings and allowed one run on two hits and one base on balls, and was credited with the win in a 5‚Äì3 AL victory at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Later that season, on September 11, 1959, he hurled a 16-inning, complete game shutout against the eventual league champion Chicago [[White]] [[Sox]], winning 1‚Äì0. It was his 11th and final win of the 1959 season, his most successful campaign in the big leagues. By age 26, however, Walker was out of the Majors. In [[190]] games [[pitched]], 90 as a starter, he allowed 734 hits and 341 bases on balls over 747 [[innings]]. He had 326 [[strikeouts]], 16 [[complete]] games, four shutouts and 13 [[saves]]. [[Walker's]] [[active]] career ended in 1967 in the Double-A Eastern [[League]]. He has maintained his involvement in organized baseball as a minor league manager, big-league pitching coach, scout and [[front-office]] executive.
