"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The [[match]] is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. [[The]] supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel [[band]], likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [[Their]] debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.","The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[song]].

The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [[is]] debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.",0

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a [[400-mile]] (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the [[roadbed]] required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, [[Lackawanna]] Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's [[conveyance]] into [[Conrail]] in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[company]] that was [[established]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"The Arizona League is a minor league baseball [[league]] that operates in and around Phoenix, Arizona. It is a rookie-level league run by Major League Baseball since 1989. Along with the Gulf Coast League, it forms the lowest rung of the minor-league system. Games are not marketed to the general public, and no admission is charged for spectators. Games are played at the spring training complexes of the teams' parent organizations from mid-June until the end of August. Every Cactus League team fields an Arizona League team with the exception of the Colorado Rockies. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, though games may be played at the team's practice fields. The regular season is 56 games, with a 35-player roster limit. Players must not have more than three years of previous minor league experience to be eligible to play. Teams primarily consist of players from the Dominican Republic and recently drafted high school and college players, and are owned by their parent clubs. Most of the players have just been selected in that year's entry draft, two to three weeks before the league begins its season.

"The Irish Independence Party ([[IIP]]) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank [[McManus]] (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). [[The]] [[party]] was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. [[The]] party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. [[Its]] best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to [[grow]] as it became [[involved]] in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger [[strike]]. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local [[elections]] of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the [[Assembly]] elections in October 1982, [[leaving]] the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early [[1980s]]. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate nationalists had remained with the SDLP. [[The]] [[party]] remained active until at least 1985, when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been [[disbanded]] before the next local elections in 1989.","The Irish Independence Party ([[ina]]) was a nationalist political [[campaign]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank [[keating]] (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).

However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. [[no]] party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. [[them]] best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to [[growing]] as it became [[organised]] in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger [[besieged]]. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local [[elect]] of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the [[assembly]] elections in October 1982, [[opening]] the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early [[1870s]]. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate nationalists had remained with the SDLP. [[any]] [[constituency]] remained active until at least 1985, when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been [[weakened]] before the next local elections in 1989.",0

Two days later she broke the NZ record over 2400 m, 2,26.1 with top weight 57 kg on three legs, as she had again gone amiss 1000 m from home, her last race. Many fine judges have Show Gate as The Best Mare ever to race in New Zealand.",3

"Ah Pook Is Here was a collaboration between author William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm Mc Neill. [[It]] [[began]] in 1970, when Burroughs was living in London and [[Mc]] Neill was in his final year of art school. [[It]] [[first]] appeared under the title The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the English Cyclops. [[When]] that [[magazine]] [[ceased]] publication, Burroughs and Mc Neill decided to develop the [[concept]] as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 pages to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco agreed to publish the proposed work in 1971 as a \""Word/Image novel\"" which was to comprise 120 pages, some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. However, the small advance [[proffered]] by the publisher made any more than a few months of working full-time on the project [[impossible]], and when Straight Arrow closed in 1974 the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, [[Mc]] Neill moved to New York in 1975 to rejoin [[Burroughs]] and continue the work. They were unable to [[find]] another publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was [[subsequently]] [[published]] in 1979 (by John Calder and Viking [[Penguin]]) in text [[form]] only under the original title of Ah Pook [[Is]] Here. [[After]] 30 years the original visual works were resurrected and [[restored]] by Mc Neill for a West Coast [[showing]] at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, CA, [[April]] 4th to May 2nd, 2009 and a December 2008 [[showing]] in New York at [[Saloman]] Arts Gallery.

"The Vancouver [[Dragons]] were a professional [[basketball]] team in the Continental Basketball Association ([[CBA]]), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises [[owned]] by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC.

"For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region. The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District. For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified.

In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses.

"I Often Dream of Trains is the third [[album]] by [[Robyn]] Hitchcock, released in 1984. [[After]] the break-up of The Soft Boys, Hitchcock [[recorded]] two [[solo]] albums — Black Snake Diamond Role and the experimental Groovy [[Decay]] — before hitting an [[artistic]] slump mitigated only by some collaborations with Captain Sensible. [[He]] re-emerged in 1984 with this all-acoustic album, the cathartic [[process]] of which he later likened to John Lennon's first [[solo]] [[work]] Plastic Ono [[Band]], as he shook off the depressing effects of the [[unsatisfying]] Groovy Decay sessions. The album was recorded in the [[space]] of a few days under the working title Crystal Branches ([[taken]] from a [[line]] in the song \""Winter Love\"", not originally included in the track [[listing]]). Hitchcock plays acoustic and electric guitar and piano and delivers direct with occasional multi-tracked vocals. [[The]] vinyl album ran to fourteen tracks, [[bookended]] by the 'classical' \""Nocturne\"". In between, Hitchcock's lyrics reference gravestones, the ghosts of derelict trams and falling leaves, the subtext of beautiful death surfacing in almost every song including the surreal-absurdist \""Furry Green Atom Bowl\"", in which he depicts \""roots in the earth and kidneys in the body\"", wryly commenting that \""That's the way to stay\"". Characteristically, Hitchcock punctuates his imagery with plenty of humour and stark, wintry arrangements which resist any descent into gloom. The album's title track accounts a train journey through Basingstoke in which he dreams of love between the buffet car and the corridor, as the winter sun falls outside the train windows. (More than 20 years later, Hitchcock would expand on this semi-hallucinatory situation in an evocative novelette accompanying the box set \""I Wanna Go Backwards\"", which details the presumably invented dream-experience which underpins the lyric, and was almost certainly conceived subsequently.) In 1986, the album was reissued on CD with tracks taken from Hitchcock's recent B sides. (One of these, \""The Bones In The Ground\"", is an archetypal death-comedy lyric delivered in a mock serious manner.) A later CD edition saw yet more extras thrown in, all of which were demos of tracks originally included, bringing the listing to a sprawling twenty-four titles. A third CD edition saw the previous demo bonus tracks dropped, along with \""Mellow Together\"", whilst adding yet more.","I Often Dream of Trains is the third [[band]] by [[robyn]] Hitchcock, released in 1984. [[towards]] the break-up of The Soft Boys, Hitchcock [[recording]] two [[split]] albums — Black Snake Diamond Role and the experimental Groovy [[decay]] — before hitting an [[unsuccessful]] slump mitigated only by some collaborations with Captain Sensible. [[they]] re-emerged in 1984 with this all-acoustic album, the cathartic [[journey]] of which he later likened to John Lennon's first [[side]] [[solo]] Plastic Ono [[band]], as he shook off the depressing effects of the [[experimental]] Groovy Decay sessions. The album was recorded in the [[matter]] of a few days under the working title Crystal Branches ([[starting]] from a [[point]] in the song \""Winter Love\"", not originally included in the track [[series]]). Hitchcock plays acoustic and electric guitar and piano and delivers direct with occasional multi-tracked vocals. [[that]] vinyl album ran to fourteen tracks, [[fronted]] by the 'classical' \""Nocturne\"". In between, Hitchcock's lyrics reference gravestones, the ghosts of derelict trams and falling leaves, the subtext of beautiful death surfacing in almost every song including the surreal-absurdist \""Furry Green Atom Bowl\"", in which he depicts \""roots in the earth and kidneys in the body\"", wryly commenting that \""That's the way to stay\"". Characteristically, Hitchcock punctuates his imagery with plenty of humour and stark, wintry arrangements which resist any descent into gloom.

She is being chased because she deciphered the code which everyone wants so badly, and the word is \""Vodka\"". \""Vodka\"" is sung in English, but starts with the word Na Zdarovye, a supposedly Russian word for \""Cheers!\"" toast. The song sparked comments that it was crafted to attract Eastern Europeans' votes, but the authors denied the accusations saying that the song was not even intended to enter the competition. The song title is a source of numerous puns in newspaper titles, but Morena in her interview says she does not like vodka and in fact rarely drinks alcohol. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, \""Vodka\"" was sung in the 2nd semifinal on Thursday 22 May 2008, where it received 38 points and placed 14th in the semifinal, with Malta failing to qualify for the final for the second time. The song was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 2009 contest by Chiara with \""What If We\"".",1

"Habibi (foaled 4 September 2009) is a New Zealand thoroughbred [[racehorse]]. She is most noted for winning the 2013 New Zealand Derby; one of only five fillies since 1980 to achieve this feat. She is trained by Donna and Dean Logan. Habibi made her raceday debut in October 2012, winning at her home track of Ruakaka. Wins at Avondale and Ellerslie followed, before she was asked to take on the top male three-year-olds over the Ellerslie Christmas Carnival. This decision proved successful, with Habibi easily winning both the Great Northern Guineas on Boxing Day and the Championship Stakes on New Year's Day. These wins made her unbeaten in five starts, and saw her become a clear favourite for the New Zealand Derby. A solid run for third in the Avondale Guineas was her only subsequent lead-up run to the Derby. In the Derby, she started from the inside barrier, settled four-back on the rail before getting clear in the straight and running down another filly, Fix, for a half-length win. The victory gave rider Vinnie Colgan his fifth success in the New Zealand Derby, the most of any rider since the race was moved to Ellerslie in 1973.","Habibi (foaled 4 September 2009) is a New Zealand thoroughbred [[race]].

"The Army of the Danube (French: Armée du Danube) was a field [[army]] of the French Directory in the 1799 southwestern campaign in the Upper Danube valley. It was formed on 2 March 1799 by the simple expedient of renaming the Army of Observation, which had been observing Austrian movements on the border between French First Republic and the Holy Roman Empire. It was commanded by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, 1st Comte Jourdan (1762–1833). The formation of the army was part of the French Directory's long term strategy to undermine Habsburg influence in the Holy Roman Empire, and, conversely, to strengthen French hegemony in central Europe after the wars of the First Coalition and the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. Despite the Treaty, Austria and France remained suspicious of each other's motives, and the purpose of the Army of the Observation was to watch for Austrian border transgressions. Understanding that the negotiations at the Congress of Rastatt were going no-where, the Army of Observation was instructed to cross the Rhine. Once across the Rhine, the Army of the Danube, was to secure strategic positions in southwestern Germany (present day Baden-Württemberg) and engage Archduke Charles' Austrian army. In the meantime, the Army of Helvetia, under command of André Masséna, would secure such strategic locations as St. Gotthard Pass, the Swiss Plateau, and upper Rhine basin. The army participated in four battles. In the battles of Ostrach and first Stockach, the Army of the Danube withdrew after suffering heavy losses. After reorganization, in which elements of the army were combined with Massena's Army of Switzerland, it withdrew after an engagement with Charles' superior force at Zürich in early June 1799; only in the Second Battle of Zurich did the Army of the Danube secure an uncontested victory.

"Dorado Wings was a small [[airline]] that operated from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Dorado Airport in the tourist center of Dorado. Dorado Wings was the only commercial operator at Dorado Airport. Dorado Wings existed from 1964 to 1982. In early 1981, the airline was purchased and its name was changed to Crown Air which operated until 1988. Aircraft operated were 13 BN-2A (Britten Norman Islanders), 3 Handley Page Jetstreams, 5 DHC-6-300 (Twin Otters), 1 Piper Navajo, and 1 Metroliner. Flights from San Juan to Dorado took a mere 15 minutes. Because of the shortness of their flights, Dorado Wings airplanes were a constant sight every day at many airports throughout this part of the Caribbean. Airports served in Puerto Rico were San Juan International (SJU), Isla Grande (SIG), Dorado Beach (DBA), Mayagüez (MAZ), Palmas Del Mar (PDM), and Aguadilla (BQN) (former Ramey Airforce Base). Other airports served were St. Thomas (STT), St. Croix (STX), Tortola/Beef Island BVI (EIS), Virgin Gorda BVI (VIJ), St. Kitts (SKB), St. Maarten/St. Martin (PJM), St. Barts, and Anguilla (AXA).
