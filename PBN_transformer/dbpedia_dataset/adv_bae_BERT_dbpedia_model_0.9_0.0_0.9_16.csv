Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional [[character]] in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group [[disbanded]] soon thereafter.

In 1969, the band recorded their only [[released]], Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC [[group]] Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group [[emerged]] soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, [[capitol]] Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver something distinctly harder edged\"".",0

"William [[Harold]] Lee (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern [[College]]. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia [[architect]] Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a [[year]], before [[transferring]] to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied [[architecture]].

These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey.

"(For their \""best of\"" album, see The Best of Judas Priest: Living After Midnight.) \""Living After Midnight\"" is a [[song]] by British heavy metal band Judas Priest. It was originally featured on their 1980 album British Steel, which was their first gold album in the United States selling more than 500,000 copies (and eventually went platinum for selling at least 1 million). The song speaks to the hedonistic, rebellious spirit of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is among the band's most popular songs. On live performances, the line, \""I took the city 'bout one a.m.\"", is sometimes changed to the particular city or venue the band is performing. For example, on the DVD Rising in the East, lead vocalist Rob Halford sings, \""I took the Budokan 'bout one a.m.\"", in reference to the stadium in Tokyo, Japan, that hosted the concert. On the Westwood One recordings from the 1983 US Festival Halford recites, \""I took some acid about 1 a.m....\"" The music video, directed by Julien Temple and shot live at the Sheffield City Hall, begins with drummer Dave Holland playing an invisible drum kit. During the guitar solo, fans on the front row play along with their cardboard guitars (which were the prominent fan symbols of the new wave of British heavy metal movement). This song has been covered by The Donnas on their album The Donnas Turn 21 (2001), by Phil Gnarly and the Tough Guys at a house party in Madison, by Saul Blanch on the tribute album Acero Argentino: Tributo a Judas Priest (2006), by L.A.

The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[band]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"".

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts. And some members of the band started touring as Dead & Company in 2015.

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of [[population]] served. The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger [[route]] in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the [[line]] has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The [[WCML]] has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.","The West Coast Main [[lines]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[routes]] in the United Kingdom.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New [[Jersey]] Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] (DL&[[W]]) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on [[December]] 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.",2

"\""Another Summer Night\"" was the Maltese [[entry]] in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, performed in English by Fabrizio Faniello. The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with Faniello describing an idyllic summer night \""by the ocean/Under the palm trees, you and I\"". He sings that this is \""magic\"" and presents the scenario as a perfect way to be with his lover. In contrast to the fast tempo songs beginning to dominate the Contest by this point, the song is quite laid-back with an acoustic guitar (first introduced immediately after Faniello sings \""A guitar in my hand\"") providing a melodic counterpoint. The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following Estonia's Tanel Padar and Dave Benton with \""Everybody\"" and preceding Greece's Antique with \""Die For You\"". At the close of voting, it had received 48 points, placing 9th in a field of 23. Despite the comparatively low placing, the song has become popular among Contest fans, with Faniello performing it as part of a medley at the Congratulations special in late 2005.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"Winback (known as [[Operation]]: [[Winback]] in [[Australia]] and Europe) is a third-person shooter [[video]] [[game]] developed by Koei's Omega Force studio for the [[Nintendo]] 64 in 1999 and PlayStation 2 in 2001. A [[second]] game with no related storyline, WinBack 2: Project Poseidon, was produced by Cavia for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox game consoles, was released on April 25, 2006. The story follows one [[Jean-Luc]] Cougar, a secret agent infiltrating a laser satellite's command center. Gameplay revolves around its innovative cover system, where the player takes cover behind corners and then ducks out to shoot. The player cannot move while shooting; instead, the control stick is used to aim, a task made easier by the fact that every weapon is equipped with a laser sight. [[The]] game was influenced by Metal Gear Solid and, in turn, WinBack's cover system eventually went on to influence several later shooters, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001) and Kill Switch (2003), which in turn influenced games like Gears of War (2006). The cover system has since become a staple of third-person shooters. WinBack also featured a laser sight mechanic that was later incorporated in action games such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and Resident Evil 4 (2005), and in turn would also become a staple of third-person shooters.","Winback (known as [[operation]]: [[x]] in [[australia]] and Europe) is a third-person shooter [[genre]] [[gaming]] developed by Koei's Omega Force studio for the [[playstation]] 64 in 1999 and PlayStation 2 in 2001.

"The Fornebu Line (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail [[line]] which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. The line is in the planning stages and the transit [[agency]] Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. [[The]] [[line]] has at various stages been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light [[rail]], stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to [[Fornebu]] were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, [[Fornebu]] opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line.

"The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[play]]. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him.

"The Bavarian [[People's]] [[Party]] (German: Bayerische Volkspartei; BVP) was the Bavarian [[branch]] of the Centre [[Party]], a lay Roman Catholic [[party]], which broke off from the rest of the party in 1918 to [[pursue]] a more conservative, more Bavarian particularist course. The party [[displayed]] monarchist [[leanings]] (because many Bavarians had never accepted the overthrow of the House of Wittelsbach in 1918) and there was a period of near separatism in the early 1920s, culminating in Gustav von Kahr's unwillingness to abide by rulings from Berlin during the autumn crisis of 1923. This only came to an end with the shock of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Following the establishment of a more stable situation throughout Germany, the [[party]] came around to a more moderate line under the leadership of Ministerpräsident Heinrich Held and party president Fritz Schäffer. During the Weimar Republic, the BVP was consistently the most voted party in Bavaria and the party with the most seats in the Landtag of Bavaria. In the second round of the German presidential election, 1925 the main contenders were Paul von Hindenburg and Wilhelm Marx. If either the BVP or the Communist Party (KPD), who put up Ernst Thalmann in the second round, had supported Marx, he would have become President instead of the elderly von Hindenburg (who died in 1934, and was succeeded by Hitler).

The party [[included]] monarchist [[tendencies]] (because many Bavarians had never accepted the overthrow of the House of Wittelsbach in 1918) and there was a period of near separatism in the early 1920s, culminating in Gustav von Kahr's unwillingness to abide by rulings from Berlin during the autumn crisis of 1923. This only came to an end with the shock of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Following the establishment of a more stable situation throughout Germany, the [[parties]] came around to a more moderate line under the leadership of Ministerpräsident Heinrich Held and party president Fritz Schäffer.

[[It]] was serialized in Weekly Shōnen [[Jump]] from 1983 to 1985, with the chapters [[collected]] into 13 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha.

To that [[end]], he creates a superhero of his own [[called]] \""Wingman,\"" and, much to the chagrin of his [[teachers]], acts out his fantasies of being Wingman at school. When Kenta [[meets]] Aoi Yume, the beautiful blue-haired princess of an alternate universe called Podreams, he gets his chance to make his fantasy come true, as Aoi carries a book called a Dream Note which can make any dream come true, and Kenta draws a picture of Wingman in the book, allowing him to become Wingman for real.

"MacHomer is a one-person [[play]] by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons.

MacHomer has been re-written a number of times. The early version of the play was more of a stand-up comedy routine, but in 2000, it was expanded into a theatrical production. In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. The script of the play \""remains 85% Shakespeare\"" and mostly follows the plot of Macbeth. Miller performs the various roles using voices from The Simpsons characters, using more than 50 voices. The set includes a video screen at the back of the stage, and sound and video effects are incorporated into the performance. Miller has performed the play in over 150 cities around the world, including performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival. MacHomer has received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics felt that the play seems more like a group of sketches, while others felt that Miller's Homer Simpson voice was one of his weaker impersonations.

MacHomer has received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics felt that the play seems more like a group of sketches, while others felt that Miller's Homer Simpson voice was one of his weaker impersonations. According to Miller, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening is a fan of the play and gave him permission to perform it.",1

"The Velvet Underground was an American rock [[band]] from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. [[Formed]] by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable events from 1966 to 1967. The provocative subject matter, musical experimentation, and often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music would prove influential in the development of punk rock and alternative music. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground are now recognized as among the most influential acts of the rock era for their integration of rock music with the avant-garde. Their 1967 debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico (featuring German singer and collaborator Nico) was called the \""most prophetic rock album ever made\"" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the \""100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"".

"Pinot noir (French: [pino nwaʁ]) is a [[red]] wine [[grape]] variety of the species Vitis [[vinifera]]. The name [[may]] also refer to wines created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes.

Pinot noir grapes are [[grown]] around the world, mostly in the cooler regions, but the [[grape]] is chiefly associated with the Burgundy region of France. Other regions that have gained a reputation for Pinot noir include the Willamette Valley of [[Oregon]], the Carneros, Central Coast and Russian [[River]] AVAs (American Viticultural [[Area]]) of [[California]], the Elgin and Walker Bay [[wine]] regions of South Africa, Tasmania and Yarra [[Valley]] in Australia and the Central Otago, Martinborough and Marlborough [[wine]] [[regions]] of New Zealand. Pinot noir is also a primary [[variety]] used in sparkling wine production in Champagne and other wine regions.

Adding Phil Donnelly and Paul Kelly amongst others, they had a long-running residency in Dublin's Olympia Theatre. The band established a format where every week a guest or guests would join them on stage. Guests at the venue included Mary Coughlan, Shane McGowan, The Waterboys, The Hothouse Flowers, Nanci Griffith, John Prine and Joe Ely. The Fleadhs toured with Bob Dylan, The Pogues, The Waterboys and Emmylou Harris. The band broke up in 1990 though they later reformed for gigs and to record. The individual musicians continued to play and record in different formations. Paul Kelly and Frankie Lane, accompanied by Eleanor Shanley, play and tour together in Ireland and throughout Europe. Pete Cummins (the band's main songwriter) released his debut solo album The Brilliant Architect in 2008 to critical acclaim. His anti-war song \""Flowers in Baghdad\"" was in the Neil Young anti-war charts Living with War, for almost two years. He continues to tour with guitarist Ger Kiely. In May 2011 the band was reformed by Pete Cummins to organize a charity event at Dublin's Button Factory, with guests Lisa Hannigan, Gay Woods, Liam Ó Maonlaí, Henry McCullough, Siobhán O'Brien, Mundy, Tír na nÓg and others.","The Fleadh Cowboys are a [[folk]] folk-rock/country [[music]].

"Radio Trinidad was the oldest radio [[station]] in Trinidad and Tobago. It began broadcasting in 1947 at 11B Maraval [[Road]] in Port of [[Spain]] on the frequency 730 [[AM]].

Two of the most popular programmes were: \n*  Sunday Serenade, a show that featured performers of the day including the Mighty Sparrow and Ken Hutcheon), broadcast at noon on Sundays co-hosted by Bob Gittens and Sam Ghany. \n*  Auntie Kay, a children's talent show named after its [[presenter]] Kathleen Davis, which ran on Sundays at 2 p.m. and was sponsored by the Bermudez Biscuit Company. The back-up band was Choy Aming and the featured pianists were Aldwyn Albino and Dawlett Ahee.

"St Reims (foaled 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[racehorse]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002. A million-dollar yearling, big things were always expected of the son of Zabeel, and although he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon started to live up to expectations. A runaway win in the Avondale Guineas at his last start before the Derby ensured that he would start favourite in the Classic, and he didn't disappoint. Given an excellent ride out in front by Greg Childs, the colt was never headed and scored a narrow but authoritative win. After the Derby his career went downhill. After disappointing performances in an autumn Sydney campaign, St Reims failed to win a single race as a four-year-old and looked to be a shadow of his former self. But at Hastings in the spring of 2004 he regained his interest in racing and put together a string of wins against horses the quality of Waitoki Dream and Zafar, culminating in a return to Group race success in the Lindauer Grandeur Stakes at Ellerslie, the scene of his Derby triumph. But he didn't stop there. He followed that win up with the Group 2 Counties Cup, a desperately close second under a demanding weight in the Group 2 Waikato Cup and a well-deserved second Group 1 victory in the Zabeel Classic at Ellerslie, just over two full years after his last Group 1 win. Following another Group 1 placing behind Xcellent in the Darley Stakes and a seventh behind the same horse in the Kelt Capital Stakes, he was retired to stand at Stoney Bridge Stud. St Reims had his first winner as a sire when two-year-old filly St J'adore, from his first crop, won a maiden race at Avondale on 7 May 2010.","St Reims (foaled 9 November 1999 in New Zealand) is a thoroughbred [[trainer]] who won the New Zealand Derby in 2002.

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the [[horse]] [[became]] the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the [[sire]] of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky.

"The Irish Independence [[Party]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). The party was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. The party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. Its best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, leaving the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early 1980s. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate nationalists had remained with the SDLP. The party remained active until at least 1985, when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been disbanded before the next local elections in 1989.","The Irish Independence [[parties]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[campaign]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a [[satellite]] providing television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time.

"[[Ah]] Pook [[Is]] Here was a collaboration between author William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm Mc Neill. [[It]] began in 1970, when Burroughs was living in London and Mc Neill was in his final year of art school. It first appeared under the title The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the English Cyclops. When that [[magazine]] [[ceased]] publication, Burroughs and Mc Neill decided to develop the concept as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 pages to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco agreed to publish the proposed work in 1971 as a \""Word/Image novel\"" which was to comprise 120 pages, some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. However, the small advance [[proffered]] by the publisher made any more than a few months of working full-time on the project impossible, and when Straight Arrow closed in 1974 the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, Mc Neill moved to New York in 1975 to rejoin Burroughs and continue the work. They were unable to find another publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was subsequently [[published]] in 1979 (by John Calder and Viking Penguin) in text form only under the original title of Ah Pook Is Here.

"\""Catherine\"" was the Luxembourgish [[entry]] in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969, performed in French by French singer Romuald (who had previously represented Monaco at the 1964 Contest with \""Où sont-elles passées\"" and would represent that country again). The song is a ballad, in which Romuald reminisces about a girl he went to kindergarten with called Catherine. He sings that he was already in love with her then, and while they have lost touch since that time, he retains his feelings for her. The song ends with his question as to whether she has found love herself, and it is unclear whether he wants her to have done so. Romuald recorded the song in four languages; French, German, Spanish and Italian. The song was performed second on the night (following Yugoslavia's Ivan & M's with \""Pozdrav svijetu\"" and preceding Spain's Salomé with \""Vivo Cantando\""). At the close of voting, it had received 7 points, placing 11th in a field of 16. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1970 Contest by David Alexandre Winter with \""Je suis tombé du ciel\"". Romuald returned to the Contest in 1974, singing \""Celui qui reste et celui qui s'en va\"".","\""Catherine\"" was the Luxembourgish [[anthem]] in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969, performed in French by French singer Romuald (who had previously represented Monaco at the 1964 Contest with \""Où sont-elles passées\"" and would represent that country again).

"The Cimmeron Show Review was originally a 1960s Revival [[Band]] originating in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA in 1972. The group originally consisted of four University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh students, Phil Barry, Scott Nelson, Gregg Tipple, and R.B.Smith. When they first started, the idea of the band was to make some extra money while they were in school. That plan included disbanding the group at graduation, which they did in the summer of 1973. After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B. Smith and Phil Barry returned to Oshkosh from New York and Chicago, respectively, and reformed the band in the spring of 1974. Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow.

The group originally consisted of four University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh students, Phil Barry, Scott Nelson, Gregg Tipple, and R.B.Smith. When they first started, the idea of the band was to make some extra money while they were in school. That plan included disbanding the group at graduation, which they did in the summer of 1973. After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B. Smith and Phil Barry returned to Oshkosh from New York and Chicago, respectively, and reformed the band in the spring of 1974. Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow.

"[[For]] just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., transported people across the city and region. The first streetcars in Washington, D.C., were drawn by horses and carried people short distances on flat terrain; but the introduction of cleaner and faster electric streetcars, capable of climbing steeper inclines, opened up the hilly suburbs north of the old city and in Anacostia. Several of the District's streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and two Virginia lines crossed into the District. For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar system was fully electrified. A bit later, the extensive mergers dubbed the \""Great Streetcar Consolidation\"" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses.

"\""Be My Wife\"" is a [[song]] and single by David Bowie. Its presence in Low tones down the electronic feel of the rest of the album. The song also [[features]] a more conventional lyric which is closer to a traditional rock song than the more fragmented lyrics elsewhere on that album. Allegedly several analysts of Bowie's career have seen the song as a last-ditch plea to Angela Bowie in the vain hope of saving his marriage. Tension apparently had arisen between the couple, and disagreements have been claimed to have arisen over the location of a new residence in Europe. Angela had shown herself to be heavily affected by his music; he had reputedly proposed to her by playing \""The Prettiest Star\"" to her over the telephone. In the end it seems here that David would not agree to move back to Switzerland from Berlin, and the relationship finally ended in divorce in 1980, which may be confirmed by the reference below. The song features a ragtime piano opening, which serves the somewhat retro lyrics some justice, although it is soon set against a backdrop of guitars and drums. The song repeats its lyrics, changing the spacing of the lyrics amongst the song's verse. The song closes simply with a fadeout, as the song returns to the introductory ragtime riff repeating indefinitely, with the rest of the band playing behind it. \""Be My Wife\"" was the second single from Low after \""Sound and Vision\"", but it became the first new Bowie release since \""Changes\"" to fail to break into the UK chart. \""Be My Wife\"" was frequently played live on the various tours after its release and Bowie is said to have repeatedly announced this song during live performances as \""one of my favourites,\"" as may be seen or heard in such concert footage or audio recordings.","\""Be My Wife\"" is a [[ballad]] and single by David Bowie.

"[[The]] New Democratic Party leadership [[election]] of 2003 was [[held]] to replace New Democratic Party of Canada leader Alexa McDonough, after her retirement. [[It]] ended on [[January]] 25, 2003, with the first ballot victory of popular Toronto city councillor [[Jack]] Layton. The election was the first to be conducted under the NDP's new partial one member, one vote system, in which the popular vote of the members is weighted for 75% of the result. [[The]] rest are votes cast by delegates for [[affiliated]] organizations (mainly labour unions). It was also the first Canadian leadership [[convention]] to allow [[Internet]] voting; delegates who chose to vote electronically were given a password to a secure website to register their votes. The race was heated, with the leaders campaigning to NDP audiences across Canada. One of the most notable events of the campaign occurred at the convention in Toronto, the day before the election, when candidate Pierre Ducasse made a stirring speech. Ducasse's speech attracted widespread praise, although its late delivery was unable to sway the postal and internet votes which had already been cast.","[[the]] New Democratic Party leadership [[party]] of 2003 was [[established]] to replace New Democratic Party of Canada leader Alexa McDonough, after her retirement.
