"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a fictional [[character]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse.

"\""Space Invaders\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979. The song is based on the hugely successful 1978 video game Space Invaders. It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and ending up as the fourth best selling single in Australia for 1980. The [[song]] was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music [[record]], \""On and On\"" (1984).

Dunlop recalled: \""We sat down and [[wrote]] a bunch of space songs, but instead of sticking to the concept of the hit, we wandered off into the 'clever' musical genre with fancy time signatures, radical chord progressions and so on.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver something distinctly harder edged\"".",0

"[[William]] Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia [[architect]] Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger [[de]] Flor to [[campaign]] against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish [[soldiers]] (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger [[t]] Flor to [[operate]] against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue [[Weirback]]. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their [[brews]] are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called [[Decadence]] brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the [[bitterest]] examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and [[quadrupel]]) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream [[beer]] may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, [[Weyerbacher]] released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% [[ABV]]),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the [[Weirbacks]] on their farm. The hops were used for [[flavoring]], not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan [[Weirback]] has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of [[small-scale]] harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.","Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[distillery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue [[hill]].

Most of their [[facilities]] are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called [[jubilee]] brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the [[finest]] examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a [[facility]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and [[legacy]]) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream [[ale]] may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, [[hill]] released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% [[ale]]),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the [[brewer]] on their farm. The hops were used for [[tasting]], not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan [[walker]] has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of [[live]] harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.",0

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[politics]] were [[registered]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

After graduating from the [[University]] of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced [[law]] in New York before returning to Kentucky and being [[elected]] to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer [[advocate]]. He [[parlayed]] that reputation into a term as attorney general, [[serving]] under [[Governor]] John [[Y]].

"Sir Matthew [[Hale]] SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an influential [[English]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[Placitorum]] Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now [[Hertford]] College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a [[Justice]] of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. [[He]] [[sat]] in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the [[Member]] of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as [[monarch]], sparking the English [[Restoration]].

Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","Sir Matthew [[tle]] SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an influential [[leading]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[v]] Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.

"Herbert [[Alexander]] [[Bruce]] FRCS ([[September]] 28, 1868 – [[June]] 23, 1963), [[served]] as the [[15th]] Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was [[educated]] as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. [[He]] was a [[member]] of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned [[Wellesley]] [[Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] which he founded in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. [[In]] 1916, during World War [[I]], he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian [[Army]] [[Medical]] [[Corps]] by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the [[Canadian]] [[Army]] (Permanent Active [[Militia]]). Bruce investigated medical practices in the [[army]] and issued a Report on the Canadian [[Army]] Medical [[Service]] which [[urged]] a complete reorganization of the medical corps. [[Few]] of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by [[Sir]] William Osler as an affront to the medical [[profession]]. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the [[time]] and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative [[patron]], Hughes, was [[obliged]] to resign. [[In]] 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]], criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific [[denunciation]] of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical [[consultant]] to the [[British]] forces, Bruce was able to advance some [[useful]] reforms in surgical management, [[including]] greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce [[purchased]] a farm on [[Bayview]] Avenue overlooking the [[Don]] [[Valley]] and built a Tudor-style mansion which he [[named]] Annandale. In 1932, he was [[appointed]] Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He [[often]] verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch [[Hepburn]] who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal [[office]] in the face of the Great Depression. [[The]] [[lieutenant-governor's]] official residence, Chorley [[Park]], was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting [[costs]]. While most [[lieutenant-governors]] are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of [[entering]] politics [[following]] his term as the King's [[representative]]. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the [[middle]] of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce [[contested]] and won Spence's seat in the Canadian [[House]] of [[Commons]] in the 1940 federal election. [[Sitting]] as the Conservative Member of Parliament for [[Parkdale]], Bruce was an outspoken [[advocate]] of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"In Greek mythology, [[Lepreus]] (Λεπρεύς) was a son of Caucon (Glaucon) or [[Pyrgeus]], and grandson of Poseidon; one [[account]] calls him son of Poseidon. His mother was Astydameia, daughter of [[Phorbas]]. [[Lepreus]] once advised Augeas to cast Heracles in bonds, so that Augeas wouldn't have to keep his promise to reward Heracles for [[cleansing]] of his stables. Since then, Heracles hated Lepreus; but when he [[came]] to [[Caucon's]] house after completing his twelve labors, Astydameia insisted that he [[reconcile]] with her son. Lepreus then challenged Heracles to [[several]] friendly competitions, [[namely]] throwing a discus, drawing water, and seeing which of the two was the fastest [[eater]], each having to consume a bull at a [[time]]. [[Despite]] his absolute confidence, Lepreus lost all the [[competitions]]. After getting beaten in a drinking [[contest]] as [[well]], he challenged Heracles to single combat and was killed during the match.

"George Briscoe [[Kerferd]] (21 January 1831 – 31 December 1889), Australian colonial politician, was the 10th Premier of Victoria. Kerferd was [[born]] in Liverpool, the son of G. B. Kerferd, a merchant (or Joseph [[Kerferd]], a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, née Blundell) [[Kerferd]] was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however circumstances led him to enter his father's business. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in [[Beechworth]] and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of [[Beechworth]] 1863-64 and three other occasions. In 1853 he married Ann Martindale, with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer. Kerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November 1864, and represented the area continuously until February 1886. He began studying law in 1864 and was Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of James McCulloch 1868, and Solicitor-General 1872-1874 and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874 Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry. Kerferd's Treasurer, [[James]] Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced free [[trader]], and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by Charles [[Gavan]] Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a land [[tax]] and a tax on beer and spirits. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August 1875. Kerferd was again [[Attorney-General]] in later conservative governments (1875–1877, 1880 and 1883–86, in the Service government). In 1883 Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the federal convention. In 1886 he quit politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The appointment was not without controversy as several barristers had served longer in the legal profession, but Kerferd did have eight years as attorney-general. There was general agreement that Kerferd filled his role as judge with great ability. Kerferd served as a judge until his death in 1889 while on holiday at Sorrento, Victoria.

This [[was]] the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha. In Eastern Christianity and some Protestant traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people. The Orthodox Church has its own traditions regarding Mary of Bethany's life beyond the gospel accounts.",0

"[[Elisaeus]] Adougan was a late 14th century and [[early]] 15th century [[Scottish]] cleric.

This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ...

"Emil Shimoun Nona (born November 1, 1967) is the [[Archbishop]] of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, prior to this he has been the Chaldean Catholic [[Archbishop]] of Mosul in the northern part of Iraq since the consent of Pope Benedict XVI to his election on 13 November 2009. He took over the archeparchy after the murder of Paulos Faraj Rahho in early 2008. Nona, an ethnic Assyrian, was born in Alqosh in 1967. After completing his secondary education in 1985, he entered the Chaldean Patriarchal Seminary and was ordained priest on 11 January 1991 in Baghdad. From 1993 to 1997 he was parochial vicar at Alqosh, then pastor until 2000. He then enrolled at the Pontifical Lateran University. In 2005 he obtained a doctorate in theology and returned home. From 2005 he served as a professor of anthropology at the Babel College. Later, he was named vicar general of the Chaldean Catholic eparchy (diocese) of Alqosh. He speaks Syriac, Arabic, Italian, and knows English. On May 5, 2009, the Synod of Bishops of the Chaldean Catholic Church elected Nona archeparch of Mosul of the Chaldeans. Pope Benedict XVI gave his consent to Nona's election on November 13, 2009. He was ordained a bishop on 8 January 2010, with Mar Emmanuel III Delly, patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans, as principal consecrator. At the age of 42, he was the youngest Catholic archbishop in the world. Speaking on the violence in Iraq in 2014 Archeparch Nona said, all the Christians who were still living there have now fled. Nona, corroborated this while speaking with the worldwide Catholic relief service Aid to the Church in Need. “All the faithful have [[left]] the city. Who knows whether they will ever be able to return,” Abp. Nona said. “[[In]] 2003 there were still 35,000 faithful living in Mosul. Three thousand were still there in early 2014. Now probably not one is left here, and that is tragic,” the Archbishop declared. The city of [[Mosul]], with a population of three million, was already mentioned in the Bible as Nineveh, and for thousands of years it has been a place of Christian civilisation. Archbishop Nona reported on the capture of Mosul: “We have never experienced anything like it before. A major city like Mosul has fallen victim to chaos.” The fighting, he said, began on Thursday, June 5; at first, however, it was limited to several districts in the western part of the city. “The army began to bombard the areas that were affected, but then the armed forces and the police suddenly left Mosul during the night between Monday and Tuesday, leaving the city at the mercy of the aggressors.” More than half of the inhabitants and the entire Christian community immediately fled to the nearby Nineveh Plain. “At around 5:00 on Tuesday morning we took in the families of refugees and tried to lodge them in schools, catechism classrooms and abandoned houses,” Nona reported.","Emil Shimoun Nona (born November 1, 1967) is the [[archdiocese]] of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, prior to this he has been the Chaldean Catholic [[diocese]] of Mosul in the northern part of Iraq since the consent of Pope Benedict XVI to his election on 13 November 2009.

After a decade, the band split up and Stubbs has only played sporadically since. Stubbs' first [[radio]] job was a weekly bluegrass show for WYII in Williamsport, Maryland, in 1983 where he earned $20 per program. In 1984, he was hired by WAMU in Washington, D.C. and worked alongside the veteran country deejay Gary Henderson. He received his own show in 1990 but continued to do odd-jobs such as house-painting to supplement his income. \""No one gets rich in radio,\"" he observed. The Eddie Stubbs Show on WAMU was discontinued in April 2007. He developed a friendship with the country singer Kitty Wells and her husband, the guitar player and singer Johnnie Wright, and played with them during D.C. area appearances. They eventually convinced Stubbs to move to Nashville in 1995 and join them full-time. But within seventeen days of arriving in the country music capital, he was hired by The Grand Ole Opry as a regular announcer. \""Five people up for the job, and the new kid in town gets the gig? If that's not God, I don't know what is,\"" said Stubbs. A self-taught music scholar, he brings an exhaustive knowledge to his radio shows, working without notes during his show which regularly beats FM country stations in Nashville in the Arbitron ratings. In 2002, Stubbs was named the Country Music Association's Large Market Air Personality of the Year.

In 1984, he was hired by WAMU in Washington, D.C. and worked alongside the veteran country deejay Gary Henderson. He received his own show in 1990 but continued to do odd-jobs such as house-painting to supplement his income. \""No one gets rich in radio,\"" he observed. The Eddie Stubbs Show on WAMU was discontinued in April 2007. He developed a friendship with the country singer Kitty Wells and her husband, the guitar player and singer Johnnie Wright, and played with them during D.C. area appearances. They eventually convinced Stubbs to move to Nashville in 1995 and join them full-time. But within seventeen days of arriving in the country music capital, he was hired by The Grand Ole Opry as a regular announcer. \""Five people up for the job, and the new kid in town gets the gig? If that's not God, I don't know what is,\"" said Stubbs. A self-taught music scholar, he brings an exhaustive knowledge to his radio shows, working without notes during his show which regularly beats FM country stations in Nashville in the Arbitron ratings. In 2002, Stubbs was named the Country Music Association's Large Market Air Personality of the Year. The alternative weekly, Nashville Scene, named him Best Country Deejay, and he has also been listed in Nashville Life magazine's 100 Coolest People.",0

"Constantine [[Heraclius]] (Greek: [[Κωνσταντῖνος]] Ἡράκλειος, Latin: Flavius Constantinus Heraclius (Heraclianus) Augustus; 626–641), commonly known by the diminutive Heraklonas or Herakleonas (Greek: Ἡρακλωνᾶς/Ἡρακλεωνᾶς), or rarely, Heraclius II, was the [[son]] of Heraclius and his niece Martina, and was Byzantine Emperor briefly between February and September 641. He was baptised and officially reigned as Flavius Constantinus Heraclius, but the diminutive nickname Heraklonas, little Heraclius, became established in Byzantine texts and has become standard in historiography. Heraklonas was probably born at Lazica while his father was on campaign against Khosrau II of the Sassanid Empire. He was probably the fourth son of Martina and Herakleios, but the first one born free of physical deformity and eligible for the throne. Towards the end of Heraclius' reign he obtained through his mother’s influence the title of Augustus on July 4, 638, and after his father’s death was proclaimed joint emperor with his older half-brother Constantine III (Herakleios Constantine). The premature death of Constantine III, in May 641, left Heraklonas sole ruler. But a suspicion that he and Martina had murdered Constantine led soon after to a revolt under the general Valentinus, who forced Heraklonas to accept his young nephew Constans II as co-ruler. Martina intended to balance this setback with the coronation of her younger son the Caesar David (Tiberios) as emperor. But this merely irritated the supporters of Constans II, and Valentinus spread rumors that Martina and Heraklonas intended to eliminate Constans and his supporters. The revolt which ensued toppled Heraklonas and his mother, who were subjected to mutilation and banishment. This was the first time a reigning emperor had been subjected to mutilation, which was a practice probably borrowed from the Persians; in this case, Martina's tongue and Heraklonas' nose were cut out. Nothing further is known about Heraklonas after his removal and exile to Rhodes. He is presumed to have died later that year. Constans II, the son of Constantine III, became sole emperor.","Constantine [[v]] (Greek: [[[UNK]]] Ἡράκλειος, Latin: Flavius Constantinus Heraclius (Heraclianus) Augustus; 626–641), commonly known by the diminutive Heraklonas or Herakleonas (Greek: Ἡρακλωνᾶς/Ἡρακλεωνᾶς), or rarely, Heraclius II, was the [[sons]] of Heraclius and his niece Martina, and was Byzantine Emperor briefly between February and September 641.

"Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame [[Thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky. In 1982, Ten Broeck was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.","Ten Broeck (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame [[thoroughbred]] [[jockey]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was immortalized in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks.

"The Irish Independence [[Party]] (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus ([[former]] Unity [[MP]] for Fermanagh & South [[Tyrone]] between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer ([[son]] of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the [[Nationalist]] [[Party]] between 1953 and 1969). [[The]] party was [[effectively]] a merger of Unity and the Nationalist [[Party]], as the [[bulk]] of activists and councillors from the two movements [[joined]] [[IIP]]. However several independent councillors also joined the [[party]]. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social [[Democratic]] and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, [[later]] the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, [[County]] Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster [[Defence]] Association. The party [[first]] [[came]] to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. [[Its]] [[best]] result [[came]] in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy [[captured]] 12,055 votes (19%), however the [[main]] effect was to split the Nationalist vote and [[prevent]] the SDLP from gaining the seat. The [[IIP]] continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to [[support]] prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, [[Omagh]] and [[Newry]] & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, leaving the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early [[1980s]]. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for [[example]] in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%.
