"Perfect Records was a United States-based [[record]] [[label]] founded in 1922 by Pathé Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

"Lago di Piediluco is a [[lake]] that straddles the [[border]] between the [[Province]] of [[Terni]], Umbria, [[Italy]] and the [[Province]] of Rieti, [[Lazio]]. [[At]] an [[elevation]] of 375 [[m]], its surface [[area]] is 1.58 km². [[The]] [[lake]] is [[formed]] by the inflow of [[water]] from [[three]] [[sources]]: the Rio Fuscello, the Velino [[river]] and the Nera [[river]]. The [[flow]] from the Rio Fuscello is [[naturally]] [[occurring]], while the [[flows]] from the Nera and Velino rivers are [[each]] [[influenced]] in some [[part]] due to man-made means. A [[partial]] [[diversion]] of the Nera in the Nera [[river]] [[valley]] (Valnerina) [[conducts]] the [[flow]] [[via]] a [[lengthy]] [[aqueduct]] and canal [[system]] [[built]] in the 1920s during the [[fascist]] regime of [[Benito]] Mussolini, [[entering]] the [[lake]] at the [[northwestern]] [[end]] of the [[village]] of Piediluco, [[near]] the entrance to the [[town]] from the \""[[Via]] Ternana\"" SS79 motorway. [[A]] canal of [[approximately]] 400 meters' [[length]] was [[built]], also in the 1920s, to [[divert]] the Velino river from its [[existing]] natural [[course]] into the lake.

[[At]] one [[time]] the [[lake]] was part of a [[much]] [[larger]] [[lake]], [[known]] from [[Roman]] [[times]] as \""Lagus Velinus\"" or Lake Velino.

"(148209) 2000 CR105, also written as (148209) 2000 CR105, is the tenth-most-distant [[known]] [[object]] in the Solar [[System]] as of 2015. [[Considered]] a [[detached]] [[object]], it [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] in a [[highly]] [[eccentric]] orbit every 3305 [[years]] at an [[average]] [[distance]] of 222 [[astronomical]] [[units]] ([[AU]]).

The albedo is [[expected]] to [[be]] [[low]] [[because]] the [[object]] [[has]] a [[blue]] (neutral) [[color]]. [[However]], if the albedo is higher, the object could easily be half that size. (148209) 2000 CR105 and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational influence of the planet [[Neptune]] even at their perihelion distances (closest approaches to the Sun). It is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been put forward: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered (albeit unlikely), [[giant]] planet. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an undiscovered [[companion]] [[star]] [[orbiting]] the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another [[planetary]] [[system]] during a close [[encounter]] [[early]] in the Sun's [[history]].

(148209) 2000 CR105 is [[estimated]] to [[be]] 2–3 [[times]] more [[likely]] to [[be]] a [[captured]] [[planetary]] [[object]] than Sedna.

"90377 Sedna is a large minor [[planet]] in the [[outer]] reaches of the Solar [[System]] that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 astronomical [[units]] ([[AU]]) from the [[Sun]], about [[three]] [[times]] as [[far]] as Neptune.

"The Arkansas RiverBlades was a short-lived minor-league ice hockey [[team]] [[located]] in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team. During the 2000–2001 season the team hosted the ECHL All-Star game at Alltel Arena. Head coach Jeff Ward. Assistant coach Brad Gratton. In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central [[Hockey]] League team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down. In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–2004 season but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others.

The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team.
