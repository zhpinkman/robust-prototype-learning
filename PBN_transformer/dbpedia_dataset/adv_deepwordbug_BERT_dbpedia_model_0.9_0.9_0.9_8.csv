In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; [[Limpar's]] teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

"[[William]] Harold [[Lee]] ([[December]] 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an [[American]] 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and [[later]] the chief [[architect]] for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied [[architecture]]. During his career, Lee designed [[numerous]] theaters and several [[buildings]] at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which [[still]] exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn [[Mawr]], Pennsylvania, the [[Hiway]] [[Theatre]] in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne [[Theatre]] in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street [[Theatre]] at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South [[Street]] in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee [[designed]] the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John [[Medeski]] (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, [[washboard]]), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by [[Medeski]] and members of the North Mississippi [[Allstars]], both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and [[sing-song]] preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by [[Medeski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric [[washboard]] on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi [[Allstars]]. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a [[satellite]] providing television and communication services for ITSO and [[Inmarsat]], which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by [[Aeronutronics]]. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 [[kilowatts]]. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency [[xenon]] ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to [[launch]] the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the [[Baikonur]] [[Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan. [[PAS-5]] provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the [[satellite's]] payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat). The television channels it broadcasts include BBC World News, Australia Network and regular feeds of Entertainment Tonight and The Wall Street Journal Report. As of September 28, 2012, BBC World News was replaced with a static video slate advising that the service would be only available on the existing horizontally aligned lower powered Pacific beam on Intelsat 19 which is 3.94 GHz @ 27.69 MBd QPSK 3/4.
