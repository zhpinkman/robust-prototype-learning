In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute.

The [[magazine]] [[began]] as a black and [[white]] [[periodical]] with David Emrich, of David Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from 2004 to 2007.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating [[point]] of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the [[former]] empire of Mitanni.

In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared.

The [[residue]] of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal [[province]] called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite [[power]] Mursili [[troika]] (better [[know]] as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili [[3]] ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be [[capacity]] with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared [[one]] and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a [[sack]] attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is [[bed]] today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its [[consequence]] was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.",5

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also [[known]] as the New [[Jersey]] Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad ([[DL]]&W) between 1908 and 1911.

The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

"The Usoi [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] landslide [[dam]] along the Murghab River in Tajikistan. At 567 metres (1,860 ft) [[high]], it is the [[tallest]] [[dam]] in the [[world]], either natural or man-made. The [[dam]] was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake [[caused]] a [[massive]] landslide that blocked the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply [[sloped]] river valley of the Murghab, which [[cuts]] from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is [[named]] after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] [[rises]] to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by Usoi Dam now holds Sarez Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the dam, which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The [[flow]] averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the Usoi Dam may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. The Murghab's river valley tends to be relatively [[narrow]] and [[steep]].
