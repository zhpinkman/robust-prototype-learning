"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships.

On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender.

It is located in the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences of Trinity College. Established in 1964, its MBA is one of the three original MBA programmes in Europe. In 1976, the M.Sc. (Mgmt) degree in Management Practice for practising senior executives was launched, with a curriculum based on action research principles. In 2015 Trinity Business School embarked on a high growth strategy that will more than double the size of the School and includes the development of new and existing programmes, as well as the construction of a cutting-edge building for the School (that will incorporate an Innovation and Entrepreneurship hub). The new business complex will open up onto Pearse Street on one side, helping to reinvigorate that street, and overlook the iconic Trinity rugby field on the other.

Originating as a School of Commerce, which was established in 1925 to offer B.A. and B.Comm. degrees in Trinity College, the School was transformed into a School of Business Studies in the 1960s. It is located in the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences of Trinity College. Established in 1964, its MBA is one of the three original MBA programmes in Europe. In 1976, the M.Sc. (Mgmt) degree in Management Practice for practising senior executives was launched, with a curriculum based on action research principles. In 2015 Trinity Business School embarked on a high growth strategy that will more than double the size of the School and includes the development of new and existing programmes, as well as the construction of a cutting-edge building for the School (that will incorporate an Innovation and Entrepreneurship hub). The new business complex will open up onto Pearse Street on one side, helping to reinvigorate that street, and overlook the iconic Trinity rugby field on the other. The project is expected to be completed by early 2019. In the meantime, Trinity Business School is located on two sites, one at Aras an Phairsaigh, within the main Trinity campus and another at 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2. In 2015 and 2016 it began rolling out a series of pre-experience masters and advanced diploma programs in support of this growth plan",0

"Russells [[Hall]] Hospital is an [[NHS]] general [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first [[planned]] in the 1960s as a [[general]] hospital for Dudley and the [[surrounding]] area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next [[five]] years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not [[open]] to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The [[new]] hospital included an accident and emergency unit to [[replace]] those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells [[Hall]] to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"AIA [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest independent public listed pan-Asian [[life]] [[insurance]] [[group]]. It has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as [[well]] as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur.

"Dark Discoveries is an internationally [[distributed]], quarterly [[slick]] [[magazine]] formerly [[published]] by Dark Discoveries [[Publications]], and now published by Journalstone, LLC. It focuses primarily on the horror fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction genres. The magazine's content includes short fiction, interviews, nonfiction articles, profiles of industry notables, and is fully illustrated. Dark Discoveries Publications was originally founded in January, 2004 by James R. Beach of Longview, WA. The magazine began as a black and white periodical with David Emrich, of David Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from 2004 to 2007. Together Editor-in-chief Beach and designer Emrich created the basic look and feel of the magazine that continued through the first ten issues. Designer Cesar Puch briefly took over the layout for two issues in 2008, but left for a job with Bad Moon Books after that. Dark Discoveries then became a color publication in 2009 after Jason V Brock became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni Productions, LLC, who also maintained the Dark Discoveries website) and Art Director in 2008, helping to salvage the magazine from being discontinued by publisher Beach. Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was [[credited]] as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press.

"Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[born]] 10 January 1952 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and [[former]] European junior [[champion]]. Many honours and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the [[best]] result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing [[second]] place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster [[title]] was [[ratified]]. He has an impressive [[collection]] of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 ([[shared]] with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 ([[shared]] with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. [[Playing]] the Hungarian [[Open]] Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 [[points]] ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= [[finish]] at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 [[silver]] medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[digest]] 10 January 1952 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and [[other]] European junior [[sensation]].

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was [[discovered]] by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[star-shaped]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, [[form]] the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \""[[sac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the [[Ascomycota]] are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously [[placed]] in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now [[identified]] and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This [[group]] is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally [[important]] compounds, such as antibiotics and for [[making]] bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar [[examples]] of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia [[belong]] to the [[Ascomycota]]. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery [[mildews]].

[[Most]] famously, Neurospora crassa, several species of yeasts, and Aspergillus species are [[used]] in many genetics and cell biology [[studies]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Battle of Niḫriya was the culminating [[point]] of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the [[remnants]] of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma [[I]] (13th century BCE) [[conquered]] Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and [[distributed]] the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong.

The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.",5

"The Taradale Viaduct is a [[large]] wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time [[one]] of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934.

In 1916, during [[World]] War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the [[rank]] of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce [[investigated]] medical practices in the army and [[issued]] a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a [[complete]] reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for [[general]] reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was [[disowned]] by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his [[conservative]] patron, Hughes, was obliged to [[resign]]. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – November 1972) was a [[Welsh]] professional footballer and Wales international. He [[began]] his career at his hometown [[club]] Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was [[organised]] by his former schoolteacher. [[A]] hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his [[spell]] at the [[club]] was [[interrupted]] by the outbreak of the [[First]] World War, during which Keenor [[served]] in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became [[known]] as the Football Battalion, [[led]] by Major [[Frank]] Buckley. During the [[conflict]], he fought in the Battle of the Somme, [[suffering]] a [[severe]] shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After [[lengthy]] rehabilitation, he [[returned]] to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the [[rank]] of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful [[period]] in their history, winning promotion to the First Division [[one]] season after [[joining]] the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, [[suffering]] a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he [[replaced]] the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final [[later]] in the season, where they [[defeated]] Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based [[outside]] England's [[borders]]. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had [[entered]] a [[decline]] that [[culminated]] with [[relegation]] to the [[Third]] Division South in the 1930–31 [[season]], when he was [[released]]. During his time at Ninian Park, he [[made]] over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats.

Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006. A new stadium (see New Zenit Stadium) is under construction, tentatively scheduled to open in 2016.",2

There were plans to [[smash]] the hotel in 1985, but they were scrapped afterwards. The hotel was refurbished sometime after 1989 when the Orient-Express Hotels bought it. Since being refurbished, the hotel once again rose to the [[meridian]] of Rio de Janeiro's (and South America's) luxury 5-star hotel market. (In March 2014 Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. renamed itself Belmond Hotels, and the hotel was renamed Belmond Copacabana Palace.) Many famous people have been guests at the Copacabana Palace, including Madonna, Michael Jackson, Robbie Williams, Walt Disney, Rolling Stones, Elizabeth Taylor, Elton John, Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Gina Lollobrigida, Brigitte Bardot, Diana, Princess of Wales, Harald V of Norway, Queen Sonja of Norway, Luciano Pavarotti among others. In 1998, Alexander Frey conducted the Rio de Janeiro Philharmonic Orchestra in a sold-out gala concert in the hotel's Golden Room featuring the music of James Helme Sutcliffe, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Johannes Brahms. In 2008, the Copacabana [[castle]] was [[support]] as a cultural [[birthright]] of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It had already previously been appointed as such by the federal government (8/14/86), by the municipal government (4/7/2003) and in 10/30/2008 was confirmed as such by all three spheres of government.",2

He is of Greek [[descent]], his [[father]] having been [[born]] in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal grandmother in Kalymnos, also in Greece. [[In]] September 1948 the family [[moved]] to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. [[As]] a [[child]] he was [[known]] as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his name \""Athanasios\"", but when he [[started]] university he adopted the [[name]] \""[[John]]\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""[[province]]\"" within the South African domestic cricket setup. [[While]] a student at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard [[making]] his first-class debut on 24 June 1967 when he represented South African Universities against Cambridge University, taking [[5]]–54 in the first innings. He represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. He [[made]] his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while [[still]] a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali Bacher.

This appearance came a record 22 [[years]] and 222 days after his previous Test appearance, and he repaid the selectors' decision with his best Test bowling figures of 5/86.
