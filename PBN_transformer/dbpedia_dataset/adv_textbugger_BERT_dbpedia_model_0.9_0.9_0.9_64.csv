"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in [[Cheshire-Prospect]], Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions.

"The Arkansas RiverBlades was a short-lived minor-league ice hockey [[team]] located in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team.

In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central Hockey League team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down. In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–2004 season but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely.

"[[Federal]] [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","[[Fеderal]] [[electionѕ]] were [[hed]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The [[group]] performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.","The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the [[culminating]] [[point]] of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for [[control]] over the [[remnants]] of the former empire of Mitanni. When [[Šuppiluliuma]] I (13th [[century]] [[BCE]]) [[conquered]] Mitanni, he created two [[provinces]] ([[Aleppo]] and [[Carchemish]]), and distributed the [[large]] part of territories of this kingdom between his [[allies]]. [[The]] rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a [[Hittite]] vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the [[Hittite]] king [[Mursili]] [[III]] ([[better]] known as [[Urḫi-Tešub]]), [[Ḫanigalbat]] was [[conquered]] by the [[Assyria]] Empire and the [[Assyrians]] [[controlled]] the [[East]] bank of the [[Euphrates]].

(i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) [[The]] Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti.

"MoreArt is an [[annual]] art in public spaces [[event]] along the City of Moreland's iconic Upfield Bike Path, railway corridor and Sydney Road. The first event was held in 2010. During the [[event]], tours of the artworks and sculptures are undertaken by bicycle along the Upfield bike path, often with an opportunity for the cyclists to meet and engage with the artists. The works are located from Brunswick to Fawkner, and can be accessed by bicycle, train and on foot. The idea for the MoreArt event was coined by Dan Mitchell, Moreland City Council’s Public Art Officer. The event works \""By encouraging artists to draw inspiration from and utilise disused public space, MoreArt both inserts art into the those places already familiar – if hitherto invisible – to the local community, and invites both Moreland residents and others to subsequently discover – and perhaps better appreciate – the Moreland area while touring the MoreArt “exhibition”. Some artworks are located within the historic station buildings themselves and can include audio and video projections. Other locations include in front of the Brunswick Mechanics Institute and in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. In 2013 Koalas made from gray plastic bags by Coburg resident and artist Aaron James McGarry were tied up into eucalypt trees in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg.

Goodman had an advertising deal with a PR firm that was trying to save the glass industry from losing soda pop clients to plastic bottles, so Goodman and partner Bill Ramal formed a group, called them \""The Glass Bottle\"" and produced their album. The group produced two hits, \""I Ain't Got Time Anymore\"" and \""The Girl Who Loved Me When\"", before breaking up and drifting into obscurity. Gary Criss had a few solo disco hits in the 1970s, and is now in the antique automobile business. The group's song \""Wonderwheel\"" is featured in the 1970 film \""The People Next Door\"".

Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36–50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany.

"[[The]] Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[season]] was the [[Newcastle]] Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the [[tenth]] since the [[club's]] founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that [[Michael]] [[Bridges]] would be the Newcastle Jets senior [[team]] captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his [[deputy]]. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. [[This]] resulted in the [[club]] seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the [[governing]] body would give a [[short]] term [[assistance]] [[package]], making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After [[giving]] [[Con]] [[Constantine]] [[every]] chance to show that he was able to [[prove]] financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the [[best]] course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership [[Tinkler]] stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was [[run]]. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.[[1million]] to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a [[new]] initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A [[new]] price structure for tickets includes a free [[season]] pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 [[home]] games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10. [[The]] club has a [[new]] sponsor with Hunter Medical Research Institute. [[The]] Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. The Newcastle Jets announced with the FFA and the State Government, that they would host the Los Angeles Galaxy at Energy Australia Stadium on 27 November.

Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. [[Thiѕ]] resulted in the [[cub]] seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the [[goveⲅning]] body would give a [[shor𝚝]] term [[assistaոce]] [[pac𝒌age]], making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After [[gіving]] [[Cоn]] [[Constan𝚝ine]] [[eveⲅy]] chance to show that he was able to [[proѵe]] financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the [[bes𝚝]] course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership [[T]] [[inkler]] stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was [[rn]]. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.[[lmillion]] to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a [[nw]] initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A [[neԝ]] price structure for tickets includes a free [[sеason]] pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 [[հome]] games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10. [[Tհe]] club has a [[ոew]] sponsor with Hunter Medical Research Institute. [[T]] [[he]] Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. The Newcastle Jets announced with the FFA and the State Government, that they would host the Los Angeles Galaxy at Energy Australia Stadium on 27 November. The match, an almost certain sellout, will play host to big name players; David Beckham, and Landon Donovan.",6

"The Raving Loony Green Giant Party was a political [[party]] in the United Kingdom.

The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: [[Fornebubanen]]) is a proposed rail [[line]] which would serve the peninsula of [[Fornebu]] in Bærum, Norway. The [[line]] is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. The [[line]] has at various stages been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light [[rail]], stadtbahn, [[rapid]] transit, [[bus]] [[rapid]] transit and [[commuter]] rail. The current [[proposal]] consists of a [[metro]] line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at [[Skøyen]], Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the [[line]] [[would]] connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station.

"Stránská skála (often without diacritics as Stranska skala) is a [[hill]] and refers to a Mid-Pleistocene-Cromerian interglacial most important paleontological site in Central Europe. It is situated in the eastern part of Brno, Moravia near the city districts Židenice/Juliánov and Slatina, dating to approximately 600,000 BP, as supported by paleomagnetic dating. It is a 1500 m long and 400 m wide hill, built from Jurassic limestone, especially Callovian-Oxfordian, built from light brown Caleidocrinus (Crinoid) mostly and Brachiopoddes and Coral and more other types of limestones rich of fossil fauna as well. Stránská skála hill is located in Bohemian Massif (and right on the border between the two geological provinces): Bohemian Massif (Moravian Karst) and Carpates (Western Subcarpathia- Dyje-Svratka Vale). Its northwestern slope is composed from karstified limestone cliffs in which numerous fossiliferous fissures and caves were found. Approximately 48 meter of this slope are covered by complex talus fan. At this place extensive excavations were made by paleonthologist Rudolf Musil and his colleagues in 1956-1968 which yielded rich paleothological material, including Homotherium moravicum teeth and approximately 1600 bones and bone fragments of birds from 23 families, 51 genera and 68 species. Earlier (1943) were Ursus deningeri discovered, an later rich spectrum of coastal animal fossils such as ostracods, bivalves and fishes. The other terrestrial fossil animals are represented mostly of snakes. The site is unique in that it has been a particularly abundant source of prehistoric artifacts (especially stone tools) dating from the Acheulean period, ower Baradostian to Neolitics and Eneolitics, which spanned roughly 27,000 to 20,000 B.C.

"The Bavarian People's [[Party]] (German: Bayerische Volkspartei; BVP) was the Bavarian branch of the Centre Party, a lay Roman Catholic party, which broke off from the rest of the party in 1918 to pursue a more conservative, more Bavarian particularist course.

This only came to an end with the shock of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Following the establishment of a more stable situation throughout Germany, the party came around to a more moderate line under the leadership of Ministerpräsident Heinrich Held and party president Fritz Schäffer.

"The Popular Socialist [[Party]] (Spanish: Partido Socialista Popular, or PSP) was a Chilean centre-left political [[party]] that [[existed]] between [[1948]] and [[1957]]. [[It]] was the result of the division of the Socialist [[Party]] of [[Chile]] in [[1948]] by voting and promulgation of Law No. 8,987 of Defense of Democracy in which the PS was divided in its vote and support among pro-communist and anti-communist. The anti-communist faction (which were in Bernardo Ibáñez, Oscar Schnake and Juan Bautista Rossetti) supported the law, and the pro-communist (headed by Eugenio González and Raúl Ampuero) refused. The [[anticomunist]] group is expelled but makes the Conservative Electoral Registration assign them the name of the Socialist Party of Chile. So the [[faction]] led by Ampuero adopted the name Popular [[Socialist]] Party. [[The]] [[party]] [[supported]] the presidential candidacy of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo in 1952.

"[[The]] [[Arab]]–[[Khazar]] [[wars]] were a series of conflicts [[fought]] between the [[armies]] of the Khazar Khaganate and the Umayyad [[Caliphate]] (as [[well]] as its Abbasid successor) and their [[respective]] vassals. [[Historians]] [[usually]] distinguish two major [[periods]] of [[conflict]], the [[First]] (сa. 642–652) and [[Second]] (ca. 722–737) [[Arab]]–Khazar [[Wars]], but the Arab–Khazar [[military]] [[confrontation]] involved [[several]] [[sporadic]] [[raids]] and [[isolated]] [[clashes]] as [[well]], over a [[period]] from the [[middle]] of the 7th [[century]] to the [[end]] of the 8th [[century]]. [[The]] [[Arab]]–Khazar [[wars]] were a result of the [[attempts]] of the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]] to [[secure]] [[control]] of Transcaucasia and the [[North]] Caucasus, where the [[Khazars]] were [[already]] established. The first Arab [[invasion]], in the 640s and [[early]] 650s, [[ended]] with the [[defeat]] of an [[Arab]] force led by [[Abd]] [[ar-Rahman]] [[ibn]] Rabiah [[outside]] the Khazar [[town]] of [[Balanjar]]. [[Hostilities]] [[broke]] out again with the [[Caliphate]] in the 710s, with [[raids]] [[back]] and forth [[across]] the [[Caucasus]]. Led by the distinguished generals al-Jarrah [[ibn]] Abdallah and Maslama [[ibn]] Abd al-Malik, the [[Arabs]] were [[able]] to [[capture]] Derbent and [[even]] the [[southern]] Khazar [[capital]] of Balanjar, but this had [[little]] [[impact]] on the [[nomadic]] [[Khazars]], who remained [[able]] to launch [[devastating]] [[raids]] [[deep]] into [[Transcaucasia]]. In one such [[raid]] in [[730]], the Khazars [[inflicted]] a [[major]] [[defeat]] on the Umayyad [[forces]] at the [[Battle]] of Ardabil, [[killing]] al-Jarrah, but were in turn [[defeated]] the next year and pushed back north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab military outpost and colony, before being replaced by Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future caliph Marwan II) in 732. A period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737, when Marwan led north a massive expedition that reached the Khazar capital Atil on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the khagan, the Arabs withdrew. The [[737]] [[campaign]] marked the [[end]] of large-scale warfare between the [[two]] [[powers]], [[establishing]] Derbent as the [[northernmost]] [[Muslim]] [[outpost]] and [[securing]] Muslim [[dominance]] over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the long wars weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the [[eventual]] fall of the dynasty to the [[Abbasid]] [[Revolution]] a few [[years]] later. [[Relations]] between the [[Muslims]] of the [[Caucasus]] and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from two Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure a marriage alliance between the Arab governors or local princes of the Caucasus and the Khazar khagan.

"[[The]] [[2007]] Rugby [[World]] [[Cup]] [[Final]] was a rugby [[union]] match, played on [[Saturday]], 20 [[October]] 2007 at the Stade de [[France]], Saint-Denis, Paris. [[The]] match determined the winner of the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the de facto world champions for the next four years. The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa, who had each won their [[semi-finals]] against [[France]] and Argentina respectively. The final was refereed by Irish referee Alain Rolland. The two finalists had met earlier in the competition, during the pool stage, when South Africa won 36–0, so South Africa began the final as the only undefeated team left in the competition. Had England won the competition, they would have become not only the first nation to retain the Rugby World Cup, which they had won in 2003, but the only team to win a final after having lost a game at the pool stage. Winners South Africa became the second country to win two titles, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999. The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. This gave South Africa a 15–6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try and also not conceded a try in the final.

"The Whitlam Government refers to the federal Executive Government of Australia led by Prime [[Minister]] Gough [[Whitlam]]. It was made up of members of the Australian Labor Party.

It concluded in historic circumstances, when it was dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr as a result of the 1975 constitutional crisis and was succeeded by the Fraser Government. The Whitlam Government remains the only federal government in Australian history to be dismissed by an either a monarch or viceregal representative.

"Canby Area [[Transit]], or simply CAT, is the public [[transit]] bus service provided by and for the US city of Canby, Oregon.

It has a hub at the downtown Canby Transit Center. CAT was established as a department of the City of Canby on January 1, 2002 upon Canby's withdrawal from the TriMet service area, and had an official dedication on August 20, 2002. Canby paid TriMet to continue service in the interim, and replaced TriMet's commuter runs in 2004, which received little ridership at the end.

Canby replaced TriMet's payroll tax with its own within the city, but at a somewhat lower rate, and also receives state and federal grants. Due to the loss of state tax credits and recession-caused tax revenue decreases, CAT had to eliminate Saturday service, fixed-route service within Canby and trips to Wilsonville, as well as started charging a $1 fare.

[[The]] [[station's]] announcers included June Gonsalves, [[Barbara]] Assoon, [[Glen]] Antoine, Sam Ghany, [[Ken]] Laughlin, Hugh Blackman, Larry [[Heywood]], [[Val]] Douglas, Russell [[Winston]], [[Trevor]] McDonald, [[Holly]] Betaudier, [[Peter]] Minshall, Don Proudfoot, [[Bob]] Gittens and Raffie [[Knowles]]. Two of the most [[popular]] programmes were: \n*  Sunday Serenade, a [[show]] that featured [[performers]] of the day including the Mighty Sparrow and [[Ken]] [[Hutcheon]]), [[broadcast]] at noon on Sundays [[co-hosted]] by [[Bob]] [[Gittens]] and [[Sam]] [[Ghany]]. \n*  [[Auntie]] [[Kay]], a children's [[talent]] show named after its [[presenter]] Kathleen Davis, which ran on Sundays at 2 p.m. and was sponsored by the Bermudez Biscuit Company.

"The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). The [[party]] was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. The party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. Its best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The IIP continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The IIP boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, leaving the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early [[1980s]]. As a result, the IIP [[lost]] republican support, for [[example]] in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the [[IIP]] were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%.
