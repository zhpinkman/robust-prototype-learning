"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

After an impressive first half of the 2004 season, featuring an early battle with Baltimore Orioles Melvin Mora for the AL lead in batting average, Harvey was selected as the Royals' lone representative in the All-Star Game.

The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th [[century]] [[BCE]]) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal [[state]] called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was [[conquered]] by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the [[Hittite]] throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a [[Hittite]] vassal state. (i.e. [[Ḫattusili]] faced a fait [[accompli]]) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The [[Hittites]] considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: [[Tudḫalia]] IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major [[battle]] which is known today as the [[Battle]] of [[Niḫriya]]. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit.

Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the [[Hittte]] throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a [[Hitttie]] vassal state. (i.e. [[ḪattusilA]] faced a fait [[accmpli]]) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The [[dHittites]] considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: [[Tudḫalih]] IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major [[attle]] which is known today as the [[Bottle]] of [[Niḫriua]]. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within [[Hittie]] document [[KoB]] IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the [[sattle]] must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be [[eqauted]] with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been [[shwon]] to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.",5

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment.

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

"Fred Warren Waters (February 2, [[1927]] – August 28, 1989) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout and coach. [[The]] left-handed pitcher appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955–1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. [[Born]] in Benton, Mississippi, Waters attended the University of Southern Mississippi. He stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the Pirates, Waters had a 13-season (1949–58; 1960–62) pitching career in minor league baseball. [[He]] was first signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam [[Jethroe]], pitcher Max [[Surkont]], fellow minor [[leaguers]] Curt Raydon and Larry [[Lasalle]], and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one trade in Major League history and was surpassed only by the [[seven-for-one]] deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. [[Both]] of his [[MLB]] victories came in starting roles. [[His]] first [[big-league]] triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie [[Pollet]] relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 [[shutout]] win. Over his [[25]] Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned [[run]] average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and [[sat]] out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. In three seasons with [[Pensacola's]] [[professional]] franchise, he appeared in [[73]] [[games]], largely as a [[starting]] [[pitcher]], and compiled a [[41]]–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.","Fred Warren Waters (February 2, [[197]] – August 28, 1989) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout and coach.

Then, on December 26, 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with third baseman Sid Gordon, outfielder Sam [[Jehroe]], pitcher Max [[Sukront]], fellow minor [[leagueOrs]] Curt Raydon and Larry [[Lasale]], and $100,000 for third baseman Danny O'Connell. This is the only six-for-one trade in Major League history and was surpassed only by the [[seven-forjone]] deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. Waters appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the 1955 season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. [[Bot]] of his [[LB]] victories came in starting roles. [[HiD]] first [[big-legaue]] triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie [[Pollt]] relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4–0 [[shutou]] win. Over his [[2]] Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned [[ru]] average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and [[sMt]] out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama–Florida League. In three seasons with [[Penacola's]] [[profeEssional]] franchise, he appeared in [[37]] [[ames]], largely as a [[stating]] [[picther]], and compiled a [[1]]–13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681–664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.",0

"Simplicius, [[Constantius]] and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the [[Abruzzi]] region who was executed along with his two sons, [[Constantius]] and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus [[Aurelius]]. Their [[Passio]] contains all of the [[tropes]] of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at [[Marsica]].

The [[Passio]] states that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were baptized by Saint [[Januarius]] (not, according to Antonio [[Borrelli]], the famous saint of Naples) during the reign of Antoninus Pius ([[138-161]]). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons [[Constantius]] and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. [[Pontius]], the prefect in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; Simplicius and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. They were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a fight erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. The three saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica. In the presence of the emperor, the three saints refused to abjure their faith, and were tossed into a chamber filled with snakes and scorpions, but they emerged unharmed due to the intercession of an angel. They were then condemned to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on August 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae. After the death of the three saints, an earthquake shook the town and one of the executioners was converted to Christianity, with the deacon named Florentius, a witness to the event, writing down and passing down the news of their deaths.","Simplicius, [[Constantiu]] and Victorinus (Victorian(us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century.

"Free Society (1895-1897 as The Firebrand; 1897-1904 as Free Society) was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.

Deliberately defying the Comstock laws in an act of civil disobedience, The Firebrand published Walt Whitman's \""A Woman Waits for Me\"" in 1897; A.J. Pope, Abe Isaak, and Henry Addis were quickly arrested and charged with publishing obscene information for the Whitman poem and a letter \""It Depends on the Women\"", signed by A.E.K.

"Intelsat 5 (aka [[IS-5]], [[PAS-5]] and Arabsat 2C) was a [[satellite]] providing television and communication services for ITSO and [[Inmarsat]], which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium [[arsenide]] solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat).

"Mohamed Alí Seineldín (Arabic: [[محمد]] علي زين الدين ) (November 12, 1933 in Concepción del Uruguay – September 2, 2009) was an Argentine [[army]] [[colonel]] who participated in two failed uprisings against the democratically elected governments of both President Raúl Alfonsín and President Carlos Menem in 1988 and 1990.

He converted from Druzism to Roman Catholicism during his youth, and was consecrated to the Virgin of Rosario (Virgen del Rosario). He remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life, even devoting his men in the army to the Virgin of the Holy Rosary as well. In an interview on his goals during his military career, Seineldín later explained, Luchamos por el mismo objetivo, que es la nacionalidad y la fe cristiana, which translates as, \""We fought for the same goal, which is nationality and the Christian faith.\"" Seineldín rose to prominence in Argentina during the 1982 Falklands War against the United Kingdom. An ardent Christian Argentine nationalist, Seineldín became a member of the Carapintadas, or \""painted faces,\"" group within the Argentine Army. The Carapintadas demanded that the Argentine government halt legal proceedings against army officers accused of human rights abuses during the Dirty War, which occurred during Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. The low-ranking officers were charged with a wide range of crimes, including the execution of guerrilla dissidents, torture and kidnapping of guerrilla fighters and their supporters.

"The Vancouver Dragons were a professional basketball [[team]] in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant.

In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, [[Tuckma]] cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with [[ITuckman's]] other teams. This would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; Vancouver's other professional teams were the World Basketball League's Vancouver Nighthawks, the second being the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and the International Basketball League's Vancouver Titans. The Vancouver Dragons deferred participation in the 2007-08 season citing arena issues. Most recently, the Dragons were waiting until the conclusion of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver to [[lunch]] the [[Zteam]] for the [[20101-1]] season.",0

"The President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) is a 52-mile (84 km) toll [[road]] running through the northern, northeastern and western suburbs, forming a partial loop around Dallas, Texas, United States.

At its west [[end]] near Belt Line Road in Irving, State Highway 161 (SH 161) continues southwest to Interstate 20 (I-20) in Grand Prairie. The discontinuous free frontage roads along the turnpike from I-35E in Carrollton east to its end at I-30 in Garland are assigned the State Highway 190 (SH 190) designation. SH 190 signage appears only along the Garland, Richardson, Plano, and Carrollton sections of the frontage road with the undersign \""frontage road only\"". At intersections with city streets, only the Bush Turnpike signs are displayed, not the SH 190 signage. Prior to the construction of the main lanes as a tollway, SH 190 was used as the name of the planned main lanes too. Similarly, the part west of I-35E was planned as part of SH 161. [[Bush]] Turnpike is signed as a north–south road from I-20 to [[I-35E]] (the \""Western Extension\""), an east–west road from I-35E to the Merritt Main Lane Gantry (the original sections) and as a north–south road from the Merritt Main Lane Gantry to I-30 (the \""Eastern Extension\""), as Bush Turnpike makes a nearly 90-degree curve in both places. The turnpike is operated by the North Texas Tollway Authority (NTTA). Currently, all maintenance is done under a five-year total routine maintenance (TRM) contract with Roy Jorgensen Associates, Inc. based in Buckeystown, Maryland, that started in November 2011. The turnpike passes through three Texas counties (Dallas, Collin and Denton) and nine Dallas suburbs (Rowlett, Sachse, Garland, Richardson, Plano, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving and Grand Prairie). Originally the [[PGBT]] was equipped with traditional toll plazas for cash payment as well as RFID-based TollTag express lanes. However, on July 1, 2009 the cash plazas were closed and replaced with \""ZipCash\"", an OCR-based camera system which reads the license plate and bills the owner by mail. This made the turnpike the first in the United States to transition to all-electronic toll collection. The ZipCash rates, however, come at a premium being significantly higher than both the TollTag rate and the earlier cash prices.","The President George Bush Turnpike (PGBT) is a 52-mile (84 km) toll [[roWad]] running through the northern, northeastern and western suburbs, forming a partial loop around Dallas, Texas, United States.

A bit later, the extensive mergers dubbed the \""Great Streetcar Consolidation\"" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses. After a strike in 1955, the company changed ownership and became DC Transit, with explicit instructions to switch to buses. The system was dismantled in the early 1960s and the last streetcar ran on January 28, 1962. Today streetcars, car barns, trackage, stations and right-of-way of the system still exist in various states of usage.","For just under 100 years, between 1862 and 1962, streetcars in Washington, D.C., [[transporUted]] people across the city and region.

For a brief time, the city experimented with cable cars, but by the beginning of the 20th century, the streetcar [[systhem]] was fully electrified. A bit later, the extensive mergers dubbed the \""Great Streetcar Consolidation\"" gathered most local transit firms into two major companies. In 1933, all streetcars were brought under one company, Capital Transit. The streetcars began to scale back with the rising popularity of the automobile and pressure to switch to buses. After a strike in 1955, the company changed ownership and became DC Transit, with explicit instructions to switch to buses. The system was dismantled in the early 1960s and the last streetcar ran on January 28, 1962. Today streetcars, car barns, trackage, stations and right-of-way of the system still exist in various states of usage.",0

"The 29th Illinois General [[Assembly]] was elected in November 1874. The session began on January 6, 1875 and adjourned on April 15, 1875. No party had a majority in either chamber. The Republicans had a plurality in both chambers, with 24 members in the Senate and 69 in the House, but control of the chambers was held by a coalition of Democrats, third parties, and independents. The third parties represented in this session included the Opposition Party, the Independent Reform Party, and the Democratic Liberal Party, which took many of its members (including its leader, former governor John M. Palmer) and positions from the defunct Liberal Republican Party of 1872. All of these parties were organized for the first time in 1874 and disappeared shortly thereafter, their members subsequently becoming Democrats, Greenbackers, or independents. The three-sided tensions between Democrats, Republicans and reformers led to frequent turmoil during the session, including a violent brawl that erupted in the House when Republican Alfred M. Jones threw a book at Democrat Lewis Plater. Partly due to this climate, fewer laws were passed during this session than any session since the 1830s; amounting to only 118 pages.

"Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[center]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered.

Still Mind Zendo is a not-for-profit organization in the State of New York run by a Board of Directors made up of members.","Still Mind Zendo, a Zen meditation [[ecnter]] formed in 1994, is in the Soto lineage of the late Taizan Maezumi Roshi and the White Plum Asanga. The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered.
