"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

"The Jerusalem Light [[Rail]] (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail system in Jerusalem. Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ₪3.8 billion (approx. US $1.1 billion), the project was criticized for budget overruns, for its route serving Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem and for contributing to air and noise pollution during construction. The Green line's plans have been approved by the city of Jerusalem, with tenders to be issued soon, and the approval process has started on the Blue line.","The Jerusalem Light [[train]] (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail system in Jerusalem.

Before the Grouping of 1923, the [[lines]] was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER). Following incorporation into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function – notably Cannon Street station and the Springhead Locomotive Works. Closure of the greater part of the main line itself came during the time of British Railways. As of 2011 the elevated [[works]] in Hull with some of the extensions and alterations added by the NER and LNER are still in use and referred to as the Hull Docks Branch and has the Engineers' Line Reference of HJS.",2

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed [[travel]] at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main [[line]] between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. [[The]] Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the [[roadbed]] required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off [[remained]] in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the [[Erie]] [[Railroad]] to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's [[conveyance]] into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the [[line]] in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the [[right-of-way]] to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[railroad]] that was [[formed]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – November [[1972]]) was a Welsh professional footballer and Wales international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. [[A]] hard-tackling [[Defender]], he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the [[Somme]], suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the [[rank]] of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing [[squad]] had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released.

They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"". Events surrounding the February 1905 match with Aston Villa highlighted the Coventry Road ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000. The Birmingham Daily Mail reported \""a constant stream of vehicles to the ground, while the trams were disgorging their freights at Muntz Street every two or three minutes.\"" Inside, \""the swaying of the mass of spectators rendered the placing of additional supports against the barriers a necessary precaution\"", and children were passed overhead and placed on the pitch for their own safety. The following Monday the same newspaper commented that had space been available, another ten or fifteen thousand spectators might well have attended, as \""hundreds of people found the doors closed against them, and probably there were thousands who would not go to the ground in view of the inevitable crush.\"" The club's landlords would neither sell the freehold of the ground nor allow its expansion, so the directors began planning to move to a new home.","The 1904–05 Football League [[championship]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division.

"Alan [[Dicks]] (born 29 August 1934) is an English retired footballer and football [[manager]].

"Nikolas Cassadine is a fictional [[character]] from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network. Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a recurring basis in honor of the soaps' fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular. Actor Nick Stabile took claim of the role in June 2016 in Christopher's absence.

Hailed by Soap Opera Digest as the \""Best New Male Character\"" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the supercouple of Luke and Laura's happy life with their children, Lucky and Lulu. Luke immediately despises Nikolas due to his Cassadine heritage despite Nikolas saving an ailing Lulu's life. The misunderstood Nikolas is forced to grow up when his paternity comes into question and he is led to believe that his uncle Stefan is his father, as opposed to the late Stavros. Nikolas spends majority of his life trying to get out from under his family's treachery and become his own man. In addition to other romances, Nikolas is most known for his widely popular romance with Emily Quartermaine. Nikolas also has a son, Spencer named in honor of the Spencer family. The character was written out in 2011 following his disastrous affair with Lucky's longtime love, Elizabeth Webber. The character's 2013 return features the return of his biological father Stavros, and the ending of the war between the Cassadine and Spencer families. Nikolas also vies for Elizabeth's affection with A. J. Quartermaine, and later befriends Dr. Britt Westbourne.","Nikolas Cassadine is a fictional [[characters]] from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network.

"Miles \""Milco\"" Copeland is a fictional [[character]] from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Josh Quong Tart. He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007. Ryley Mickle and Jackson Edwards played Miles in flashback sequences, showing him at ages three and eight years old respectively. During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short.

He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007. Ryley Mickle and Jackson Edwards played Miles in flashback sequences, showing him at ages three and eight years old respectively. During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short.

"Eddie Stubbs (born November 25, 1961) is a radio [[disc]] jockey [[broadcasting]] old-style country music on WSM, a radio [[station]] with a nighttime clear channel signal broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, United States. He is also one of two regular [[announcers]] for the long-running Grand Ole Opry carried on WSM on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights. He is on the air on weekday evenings from 7 pm to midnight, Central Time, on WSM. WSM's powerful nighttime clear channel signal allows WSM to be heard in a large part of the US and Canada. As a result, Stubbs has many regular listeners in all parts of the US and Canada in areas far away from Nashville. A fifth-generation resident of Montgomery County, Maryland, he graduated from Gaithersburg (Maryland) High School and became a fiddle player with a traditional bluegrass band, The Johnson Mountain Boys. After a decade, the band split up and Stubbs has only played sporadically since. Stubbs' first radio job was a weekly bluegrass show for WYII in Williamsport, Maryland, in 1983 where he earned $20 per program. In 1984, he was hired by WAMU in Washington, D.C. and worked alongside the veteran country deejay Gary Henderson.

[[Bred]] by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was [[sired]] by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten [[Broeck's]] dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the [[horse]] [[became]] the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the [[three-year-old]] Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky.

"The FIBA Basketball World Cup, also [[known]] as the FIBA World Cup of [[Basketball]] or simply the FIBA World Cup, between 1950 and 2010 [[known]] as the FIBA World Championship, is an international [[basketball]] competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the sport's global governing body. It is considered to be the flagship event of the International Basketball Federation. The [[championship]] has been held every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1950, except for two occasions. The tournament structure is similar, but not identical, to that of the FIFA World Cup; both of these international competitions were played in the same year from 1970 through 2014. A parallel event for women's teams, now known as the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, is also held quadrennially. From 1986 through 2014, the men's and women's championships were held in the same year, though in different countries. The current format of the tournament involves 24 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation. The winning team receives the Naismith Trophy, first awarded in 1967. The current champions are the United States, who defeated Serbia in the final of the 2014 tournament. Following the 2014 FIBA championships for men and women, the men's World Cup was scheduled on a new four-year cycle to avoid conflict with the FIFA World Cup.

This would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; [[neighboring]] other professional [[contenders]] were the World Basketball League's Vancouver [[ners]], the second being the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and the [[acc]] [[i]] League's Vancouver Titans.

When they first started, the idea of the band was to make some extra money while they were in school. That plan included disbanding the group at graduation, which they did in the summer of 1973. After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B.

The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow.

"[[Kikkia]] ([[sometimes]] given as Kikkiya), inscribed mKi-ik-ki-a had been the [[twenty-eighth]] ruler of Assyria to be recorded within the Assyrian King [[List]].

Consequently, the length of his reign is [[undetermined]]. Apart from his appearance in two copies of the [[Assyrian]] King List (the Khorsabad and SDAS copies, but not the Nassouhi one which is damaged at the top where he might have appeared), he is only known from two building inscriptions of his successors, moreover; the earliest of these is that of Ashur-rim-nisheshu (c. 1398 BC — c. 1391 BC), who commemorated his reconstruction of the wall of the inner-city of Assur by listing the previous restorers on a commemorative cone, (beginning with Kikkia.) The later king, Shalmaneser II, restored this wall and gave credit to his predecessor in his inscription. The erection of a defensive wall [[suggests]] that Kikkia may have won his independence from the waning influence of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. An earlier Assyrian šakkanakkum (KIŠ.NITA2) and chief magistrate of Assur, Zariqum, who had been [[omitted]] from the extant copies of the Assyrian King Lists, had been a contemporary and vassal of Shulgi (c. 2029 BC — c. 1982 BC) and of Amar-Sin of Ur (c. 1981 BC — c. 1973 BC), so one would suppose that Kikkia must have [[reigned]] after this time.

Apart from his appearance in two copies of the [[babylonian]] King List (the Khorsabad and SDAS copies, but not the Nassouhi one which is damaged at the top where he might have appeared), he is only known from two building inscriptions of his successors, moreover; the earliest of these is that of Ashur-rim-nisheshu (c. 1398 BC — c. 1391 BC), who commemorated his reconstruction of the wall of the inner-city of Assur by listing the previous restorers on a commemorative cone, (beginning with Kikkia.) The later king, Shalmaneser II, restored this wall and gave credit to his predecessor in his inscription. The erection of a defensive wall [[signifies]] that Kikkia may have won his independence from the waning influence of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. An earlier Assyrian šakkanakkum (KIŠ.NITA2) and chief magistrate of Assur, Zariqum, who had been [[hidden]] from the extant copies of the Assyrian King Lists, had been a contemporary and vassal of Shulgi (c. 2029 BC — c. 1982 BC) and of Amar-Sin of Ur (c. 1981 BC — c. 1973 BC), so one would suppose that Kikkia must have [[appeared]] after this time. Arthur Ungnad interpreted Kikkia's name, and that of Ushpia, as being that of the Hurrian language (BA VI, 5, S. 13), but more recent research no [[more]] holds this thesis as tenable, and Arno Poebel was not convinced by the interpretation.",0

The founder and resident teacher of Still Mind Zendo, Sensei Janet Jiryu Abels, is a dharma successor of Roshi Robert Jinsen Kennedy as is Sensei Gregory Hosho Abels, the co-resident teacher at the center. Still Mind Zendo emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) above all else, recognizing it as a way for people to deepen their insight and realization of their essential self, which is nothing other than the realization of their lives. And because essential self or essential nature is not bound by the limitations of any religion or gender or path in life, people from all walks of life and from all religious or non-religious backgrounds are welcomed. The singular commitment to zazen makes practice at Still Mind Zendo a simple one. Because the two teachers have chosen to be lay teachers and are not ordained as Zen priests, there are no services and robes are not worn. There is, however, deep commitment to the teachings of the ancestors; to the disciplines of the Way; to the attention to posture and detail; to the practice of being in the moment; and to the extension of that practice into every facet of life. Weekly dharma talks are given and dokusan or daisan (private teaching) is available, offering guidance in both zazen and koan study. Understanding how daunting Zen often seems, simple, practical and accessible instruction is available, beginning with the bi-monthly Zen for Beginners program. Understanding how difficult is the continuation of Zen practice, Still Mind Zendo offers strong challenge and the support of caring and like-minded people. In addition to daily zazen (except for Sunday and Monday when the center is closed), weekend and week retreats (sesshin), study sessions and related workshops are offered.
