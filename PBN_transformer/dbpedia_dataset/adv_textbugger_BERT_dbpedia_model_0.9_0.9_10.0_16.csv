The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"AIA [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest [[independent]] [[public]] [[listed]] pan-Asian life insurance group. It has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, [[wholly]] owned [[branches]] and [[subsidiaries]] in [[Hong]] Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, [[Australia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]], [[New]] [[Zealand]], [[Macau]], Brunei, a [[97]]% [[subsidiary]] in [[Sri]] [[Lanka]], a [[26]]% [[joint]] [[venture]] in [[India]], and [[representative]] offices in [[Myanmar]] and [[Cambodia]]. AIA [[traces]] its [[roots]] back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr [[eventually]] expanded his [[business]] throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In [[1945]], he relocated his [[head]] office from Shanghai to [[New]] York after a forced exit from [[mainland]] China. Thus the Asian AIA [[became]] a [[subsidiary]] of [[New]] York-based [[American]] [[International]] Group (AIG). In [[2009]] AIA [[split]] from AIG after it was [[finalized]] that AIA, as [[well]] as ALICO ([[another]] AIG [[subsidiary]]), were [[placed]] under the [[administration]] of a [[special]] purpose [[vehicle]] in [[exchange]] for the Federal Reserve Bank of [[New]] York.

However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based [[financial]] services and [[securities]] [[company]], [[announced]] that it [[would]] buy AIA for US$[[35]].[[5]] [[billion]].

In [[addition]], AIA [[entered]] into an [[exclusive]] 20-year bancassurance [[agreement]] with NDB, one of [[Sri]] Lanka's largest [[financial]] conglomerates with a nationwide [[bank]] branch network. In [[October]] 2012, AIA [[announced]] that it had reached an [[agreement]] to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance [[subsidiaries]] for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In [[December]] 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing [[agreement]] to [[sell]] all of its [[ordinary]] shares of [[AIA]] at a price of HK$[[30]].30 [[per]] share.

"[[Weyerbacher]] [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a brewery in Easton, [[Pennsylvania]], [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in [[1995]] by Dan and [[Sue]] Weirback. The [[brewery]] is [[well]] [[known]] for its \""huge [[taste]]\"" beers. [[Most]] of their [[brews]] are high in [[alcohol]], with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off [[10th]] anniversary ale called Decadence [[brewed]] to 13% [[alcohol]] by volume. Hops [[Infusion]] is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. [[Weyerbacher]] is also a [[pioneer]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform [[Old]] Heathen into Heresy, Blithering [[Idiot]] into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial [[stout]], barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale ([[6]].2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[eletcions]] were [[heⅼd]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.",5

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating [[point]] of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat.

When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

A 159 by [[96]] [[centimetres]] (63 in × [[38]] in) large [[inscription]] on the [[north]] [[side]] of the [[road]] [[lists]] Marcus [[Dunius]] [[Paternus]], the [[duumvir]] of the Helvetii Colony Aventicum, as the [[builder]] of the [[road]]. [[This]] [[inscription]] [[honors]] the emperor and [[dates]] to around [[200]] AD. [[It]] [[probably]] [[refers]] to the [[renovation]] and expansion of the existing road and the [[widening]] of the rocky [[gate]] leading into the [[pass]]. [[The]] pass road connected the Aventicum (modern [[Avenches]])-[[Salodurum]] (modern Solothurn)-Augusta Raurica [[road]] with the [[Vesontio]] (modern Besançon)-[[Epomanduodurum]] (modern [[Mandeure]])-Kembs road. The [[pass]] was first [[mentioned]] in a [[record]] from 1179 as the [[boundary]] between the [[dioceses]] of Lausanne and [[Basel]]. It [[remained]] the [[border]] between the powerful bishops until the Protestant [[Reformation]]. [[The]] first modern [[road]] was built in 1752 by the Abbot of [[Moutier-Grandval]] Abbey and the Vogt of [[Erguel]]. This [[road]] linked the cities of [[Basel]] and Biel. After the [[1797]] [[French]] victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the [[pass]] [[became]] part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the [[surrounding]] area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Bern [[widened]] part of the [[pass]] road in a section between [[Bözingen]] (now [[part]] of Biel) and [[Courtelary]]. In 1874 a railway [[tunnel]] was completed through the [[pass]] which linked Sonceboz-Tavannes. The first road that was [[passable]] for automobiles was built during [[World]] War I by the corps of engineers of the [[Swiss]] Army. In [[1932]], a new [[road]] was [[built]] employing the [[jobless]] due to the Great Depression.

"The SM Kirov Stadium was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in [[St]]. [[Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and was one of the [[largest]] [[stadiums]] anywhere in the [[world]]. [[The]] [[stadium]] was [[named]] after [[Sergey]] Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr [[Nikolsky]] and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red [[Army]] and Red Navy recruits were also [[conscripted]] as labor force for construction. [[The]] [[stadium]] was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1.

Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast.

A fully owned subsidiary of the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT), SLE provides service seven days a week along the Northeast Corridor from New London west to New Haven, with limited through service to Bridgeport and Stamford. Connecting service west of New Haven to New York City is available via Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. The service was introduced in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I-95. However, it proved more popular than expected, and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate. The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001. Around 1,900 to 2,100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season.","Shore [[Lіne]] East (SLE) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut, US.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010–[[11]] [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] since the inception of the Australian A-League and the [[tenth]] since the club's founding, in 2000.

Prior to Newcastle's round [[4]] [[games]] against Brisbane Roar, it was [[revealed]] that the club was under significant [[financial]] stress.

This enabled the club to move forward with a new [[direction]] which included resigning [[manager]] Branko Culina on a [[four]] [[year]] [[contract]], and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"[[Stránská]] [[skála]] (often without [[diacritics]] as [[Stranska]] skala) is a hill and refers to a Mid-Pleistocene-Cromerian interglacial most important paleontological [[site]] in Central Europe. It is situated in the eastern part of Brno, Moravia near the city districts Židenice/Juliánov and Slatina, dating to approximately 600,000 BP, as supported by paleomagnetic dating. It is a 1500 m long and 400 m wide hill, built from Jurassic limestone, especially Callovian-Oxfordian, built from light brown Caleidocrinus (Crinoid) mostly and Brachiopoddes and Coral and more other types of limestones rich of fossil fauna as well. Stránská skála hill is located in Bohemian Massif (and right on the border between the [[two]] geological provinces): Bohemian Massif (Moravian Karst) and Carpates (Western Subcarpathia- Dyje-Svratka Vale). Its northwestern slope is composed from karstified limestone cliffs in which numerous fossiliferous fissures and caves were found. Approximately 48 meter of this slope are covered by complex talus fan. At this place extensive excavations were made by paleonthologist Rudolf Musil and his colleagues in 1956-1968 which yielded rich paleothological material, including Homotherium moravicum teeth and approximately 1600 bones and bone fragments of birds from 23 families, 51 genera and 68 species.

"[[The]] [[2007]] Rugby World Cup [[Final]] was a rugby union match, played on Saturday, 20 October 2007 at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, Paris. The match determined the winner of the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the de facto world champions for the next four years. The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa, who had each won their semi-finals against France and Argentina respectively. The final was refereed by Irish referee Alain Rolland. The two finalists had met earlier in the competition, during the pool stage, when South Africa won 36–0, so South Africa began the final as the only undefeated team left in the competition. Had England won the competition, they would have become not only the first nation to retain the Rugby World Cup, which they had won in 2003, but the only team to win a final after having lost a game at the pool stage. Winners South Africa became the second country to win two titles, following Australia, who won in 1991 and 1999. The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties, South Africa five – four by fullback Percy Montgomery and one by centre François Steyn – and England two, both by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. This gave South Africa a 15–6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try and also not conceded a try in the final.

"McKeon [[Pavilion]] is a 3,[[500]] [[seat]] multi-purpose [[arena]] at Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga, California. Home men's and women's basketball and volleyball [[games]] are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back [[wall]]. At well-attended [[games]], the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not [[stadium]] style.

For 4-year-olds and up, it is a Grade III event set at a distance of one mile and one eighth mile on the dirt. In its 87th running in 2017, it currently offers a purse of $200,000. According to the official history at Keeneland racetrack, the Ben Ali (pronounced Ah-Lie) is named for James Ben Ali Haggin (1822-1914), a lawyer who made a fortune during the California Gold Rush and who used much of that money to create the biggest horse breeding farm in the world: the Rancho Del Paso near Sacramento, California. He also owned Elmendorf Farm in Lexington, Kentucky with its thousands of acres of prime Kentucky bluegrass. Haggin became a noteworthy breeder of great racehorses and a fervent supporter of the sport. Haggin owned the Hall of Famers, Salvator and the filly, Firenzi. The first running of the Ben Ali took place in 1917 at the Kentucky Association track in Lexington, and stayed there until 1922. It did not run again until it was revived at Keeneland in 1937.

According to the official history at Keeneland racetrack, the Ben Ali (pronounced Ah-Lie) is named for James Ben Ali Haggin (1822-1914), a lawyer who made a fortune during the California Gold Rush and who used much of that money to create the biggest horse breeding farm in the world: the Rancho Del Paso near Sacramento, California. He also owned Elmendorf Farm in Lexington, Kentucky with its thousands of acres of prime Kentucky bluegrass. Haggin became a noteworthy breeder of great racehorses and a fervent supporter of the sport. Haggin owned the Hall of Famers, Salvator and the filly, Firenzi. The first running of the Ben Ali took place in 1917 at the Kentucky Association track in Lexington, and stayed there until 1922. It did not run again until it was revived at Keeneland in 1937.

"Mosh [[n']] Roll is the [[sixth]] [[studio]] [[album]] from metalcore band [[Bury]] Your Dead. Most notably, the [[album]] marks the return of the band's former vocalist, Mat Bruso. Bruso, who departed from the band after the recording of their 2006 effort, Beauty And The Breakdown, was eventually replaced by the [then] fill-in frontman Myke Terry. During his time with the band, Terry helped write and record two full-length [[albums]]: Bury Your Dead (2008) and It's Nothing Personal (2009). Terry [[left]] the band in 2010, paving the [[way]] for Bruso's [[return]]. Mosh n' Roll contains 11 audio tracks, [[although]] the [[final]] track, \""Mosh n' Roll\"" (identical to the album title) is not listed on the back [[cover]] or in the [[liner]] [[notes]].

"Yali Dream Creations. LLC, commonly referred to as YDC, is a comics [[company]] focussed on creating original stories to engage global audiences using comics and graphic novels. Yali Dream Creations brings original and imaginative stories with an admixture of horror and fantasy; mind bending sci-fi and mythology. [[The]] company was founded in 2012 by Asvin Srivatsangam. Yali Dream Creations published its first graphic novel in 2013, written by Shamik Dasgupta. The name 'YALI' (யாளி) was inspired from Hindu Mythology. Yali ([jaːɭi]; also known as Vyala or Vidala in Sanskrit) is a mythical creature seen in many Hindu temples, often sculpted onto the pillars. It may be portrayed as part lion, part elephant and part horse, and in similar shapes. Also, it has been sometimes described as a leogryph (part lion and part griffin),[1] with some bird-like features. Yali is a motif in Indian art and it has been widely used in south Indian sculpture.[2] Descriptions of and references to yalis are very old, but they became prominent in south Indian sculpture in the 16th century. Yalis are believed to be more powerful than the lion/tiger or the elephant.","Yali Dream Creations.

"The [[USA]] Rink Hockey National [[Championship]] is the biggest Roller Hockey Clubs Championship in [[United]] States. Unfortunately, the sport in the U.S. is largely owned by roller rink operators. The sport suffers stateside since players are mostly made up of operator's family members and a gaggle of childhood friends. Since the sport transitioned to the United States in the 1960s, teams and players competing in the United States have waned as roller rinks continue to close nationwide. Often teams are completed by tapping skaters from ice or inline hockey who are willing to give it a go and round out teams at U.S. nationals; many playing on inline skates. The sport is struggling in the U.S. due to the lack of real public access to the sport found in other countries where the sport continues to grow. In contrast to other countries, the U.S. players and teams are managed and vetted by roller rink operators and their families. This practice explains the recurring players, teams, and regions who compete each year, and the loss of total number of teams since the 1960s and '70s.","The [[UA]] Rink Hockey National [[Chapionship]] is the biggest Roller Hockey Clubs Championship in [[Unitd]] States.
