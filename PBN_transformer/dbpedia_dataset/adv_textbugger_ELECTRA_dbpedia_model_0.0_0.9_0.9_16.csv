"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

Lee [[attended]] [[Trinity]] [[College]] for a year, before transferring to the [[University]] of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his [[career]], Lee [[designed]] numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in [[Shamokin]], Pennsylvania.

These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

[[He]] served in the Kentucky [[House]] of [[Representatives]] from [[1974]] to 1979, was the [[state's]] Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to [[1987]]. After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in [[1968]], [[Beshear]] briefly [[practiced]] law in [[New]] York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor [[John]] Y. [[Brown]], [[Jr]]. [[As]] attorney general, [[Beshear]] issued an opinion that copies of the [[Ten]] Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's [[classrooms]] in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor [[Brown]], the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this [[period]] was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose [[administration]] was under extended [[investigation]] by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary ‚Äì largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education ‚Äì and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, [[includes]] an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group.

"[[The]] [[naval]] [[Battle]] of the [[Solent]] [[took]] place on [[18]] and 19 [[July]] [[1545]] during the [[Italian]] [[Wars]], fought between the fleets of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of [[England]], in the [[Solent]] channel off the south coast of England between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when ·∏™attusili III ousted his nephew Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of ·∏™anigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with ·∏™atti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tud·∏´alia IV, ·∏™attusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Ni·∏´riya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-a≈°ared.

"[[The]] Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the [[Delaware]], Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] (DL&W) between [[1908]] and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail line, built upon large cuts and [[fills]], and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","[[T]] [[he]] Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[li’∏e]] that was built by the [[Delaw…ëre]], Lackawanna & Western [[Ra—ñlroad]] (DL&W) between [[19O8]] and 1911.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil [[War]], Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad.

Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the Tomb of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoƒüan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.","Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office.

The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoƒüan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",5

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] SL ([[1]] [[November]] [[1609]] ‚Äì 25 [[December]] 1676) was an influential [[English]] barrister, [[judge]] and lawyer most noted for his treatise [[Historia]] Placitorum Coron√¶, or [[The]] History of the [[Pleas]] of the Crown. [[Born]] to a barrister and his [[wife]], who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a [[strict]] Puritan, and [[inherited]] his [[faith]]. [[In]] [[1626]] he matriculated at Magdalen [[Hall]], Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to [[become]] a [[priest]], but after a [[series]] of distractions was [[persuaded]] to [[become]] a barrister like his father [[thanks]] to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his [[estate]]. On 8 [[November]] [[1628]] he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 [[May]] 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale [[represented]] a variety of [[Royalist]] figures during the [[prelude]] and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas [[Wentworth]] and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that [[Hale]] was to represent [[Charles]] I at his [[state]] trial, and [[conceived]] the [[defence]] Charles used. [[Despite]] the [[Royalist]] loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia Placitorum Coron√¶, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Si‚≤Ö]] [[Matthe‘ù]] [[Ha‚Öºe]] SL ([[l]] [[Novembe‚≤Ö]] [[1069]] ‚Äì 25 [[Decembe‚≤Ö]] 1676) was an influential [[Eng‚Öºish]] barrister, [[ju‘Åge]] and lawyer most noted for his treatise [[Histo‚≤Öia]] Placitorum Coron√¶, or [[Te]] History of the [[Plea—ï]] of the Crown.

"[[The]] men's single sculls [[competition]] at the [[2000]] [[Summer]] Olympics in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta [[Centre]]. This rowing [[event]] is a [[single]] scull [[event]], [[meaning]] that each [[boat]] is propelled by a single rower.

The pieces are: 1.  \n*  Le [[Catioroc]] 2.  \[[n*]]  In a May Morning 3.  \n*  Song of the Springtides [[Sarnia]] is an ancient Roman name for the island of Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands. Le [[Catioroc]] is a neolithic site near Saint [[Saviour]], Guernsey. A spring tide is an especially high or low tide. The [[name]] has nothing to do with the season of the year, it derives from the meaning \""jump, burst forth, rise\"", as in a natural spring.

He was [[elected]] to the [[Yilgarn]] Road Board in 1929, and [[would]] serve until 1943. [[Kelly]] first stood for [[parliament]] at the 1939 state election, as an \""[[independent]] Labor\"" [[candidate]], but was defeated in the seat of Yilgarn-Coolgardie by the endorsed Labor [[candidate]], [[George]] Lambert. Lambert died in office in June 1941, and Kelly won the resulting by-election as an \""[[independent]] [[Country]]\"" [[candidate]].

"Belfast Central Library is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

[[Rubio]] went on to win the [[Republican]] primary against only token opposition.

"[[Drive-Thru]] [[Records]], [[established]] in [[1996]], was a California-based record [[label]] owned by [[siblings]] [[Richard]] and Stefanie Reines.

"[[Elisaeus]] [[Adougan]] was a [[late]] [[14th]] century and [[early]] [[15th]] century Scottish [[cleric]]. [[His]] name has been [[said]] to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter [[datable]] to 25 November [[1390]], but this letter is simply a repetition of another [[addressed]] to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate [[Church]] of [[Lincluden]] providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of [[two]] years. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the [[Grim]]\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon [[Pope]] Clement [[VII]]. Papal authorisation [[came]] in a [[letter]] to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's [[problems]] and decline, details [[provided]] to the [[papacy]] by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or [[Benedictine]] order, to [[erect]] the collegiate [[church]] and hospice ... He still held both Lincluden and [[Kirkmahoe]] on 17 May [[1391]], when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a [[canonry]] and [[prebend]] of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus [[retained]] his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway.

It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"[[Laurie]] [[Fowler]] ([[born]] 29 [[December]] 1951) is a [[former]] [[Australian]] [[rules]] footballer who [[played]] for [[Richmond]] and [[Melbourne]] in the Victorian [[Football]] League (VFL). [[After]] finishing runner-up in the senior best and [[fairest]] count as a 16-year-old at Oakleigh Districts, Fowler was zoned to Richmond. [[Working]] his way up from the thirds side, Fowler made his [[senior]] VFL debut in 1971 and soon [[became]] [[recognised]] as a tough and courageous defender. He will be [[best]] remembered as the [[player]] who [[crashed]] into Carlton captain-coach [[John]] Nicholls at the [[start]] of the [[1973]] VFL Grand [[Final]]. The [[collision]] severely [[impacted]] Nicholls and [[helped]] Richmond avenge their loss to Carlton in the previous [[year's]] Grand Final. Richmond won the premiership again in 1974, but Fowler [[quit]] after he was omitted from the [[team]]. [[The]] Tigers [[considered]] Fowler's senior options to be limited and [[sold]] him to Melbourne, the club Fowler had supported as a child, for $15,[[000]] ([[equivalent]] to over $100,[[000]] in 2009). Fowler [[made]] an instant impact with the [[struggling]] Demons, [[winning]] the [[Keith]] '[[Bluey']] Truscott Medal for the best and fairest [[player]] at the club in his first [[season]]. Although [[primarily]] a back-pocket player, [[Melbourne]] coach [[Bob]] [[Skilton]] also [[used]] Fowler as a [[ruck-rover]] to help cover for Greg [[Wells']] lack of [[defensive]] skills in the [[midfield]]. In 1976, Melbourne narrowly [[missed]] out on the [[finals]] after Carlton drew with Footscray in the [[final]] [[round]] of the home-and-away season. Fowler was again [[among]] [[Melbourne's]] best [[players]], [[finishing]] [[runner-up]] to Wells in the Keith Truscott Medal count. Skilton was replaced as coach by former premiership player Dennis Jones at the end of the 1977 VFL season, but Melbourne's fortunes did not improve and they finished last in 1978. During that season, Fowler had to be talked out of retirement after being relegated to the Reserves, and then quit for a brief time in May after being substituted against North Melbourne. Despite receiving offers from a number of top clubs at the time, Fowler returned to Melbourne just days later and reconciled. Jones was sacked at the end of the season and Carl Ditterich returned as captain-coach. Although Melbourne did not fare much better under Ditterich, Fowler continued to stand out, winning successive Keith Truscott Medals in 1979 and 1980 and representing Victoria at interstate level in 1980 and 1981. Fowler walked out on Melbourne after contract negotiations failed before the start of the 1982 VFL season. Instead, he spent the season in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) with Waverley.

"[[Fred]] [[Warren]] Waters ([[February]] 2, [[1927]] ‚Äì [[August]] [[28]], 1989) was an [[American]] [[professional]] baseball player, manager, [[scout]] and [[coach]]. The [[left-handed]] [[pitcher]] appeared in 25 Major League games for the 1955‚Äì1956 Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in [[Benton]], Mississippi, [[Waters]] attended the University of [[Southern]] Mississippi. He stood [[5]] [[feet]] 11 [[inches]] (1.80 m) tall and weighed [[185]] [[pounds]] (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the [[Pirates]], Waters had a 13-season ([[1949]]‚Äì[[58]]; [[1960]]‚Äì[[62]]) pitching career in minor [[league]] [[baseball]]. He was first signed by the [[Brooklyn]] Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December [[26]], 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with [[third]] [[baseman]] [[Sid]] Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny [[O'Connell]]. This is the only [[six-for-one]] trade in [[Major]] League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. [[Waters]] appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the [[1955]] season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4‚Äì0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama‚ÄìFlorida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41‚Äì13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681‚Äì664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.","[[Fre‘Å]] [[W]] [[arren]] Waters ([[Februa‚≤Öy]] 2, [[197]] ‚Äì [[Au…°ust]] [[2»¢]], 1989) was an [[Ameriœ≤an]] [[pr–æfessional]] baseball player, manager, [[scouùöù]] and [[coaœ≤h]].

Born in [[Betnon]], Mississippi, [[W…ëters]] attended the University of [[Southe‚≤Ön]] Mississippi. He stood [[∆º]] [[feeùöù]] 11 [[inche—ï]] (1.80 m) tall and weighed [[15]] [[ponds]] (84 kg). Apart from his trials with the [[Pirate—ï]], Waters had a 13-season ([[199]]‚Äì[[5»¢]]; [[1‡ß≠60]]‚Äì[[6·íø]]) pitching career in minor [[‚Öºeague]] [[basebal‚Öº]]. He was first signed by the [[Brook‚Öºyn]] Dodgers, then acquired by the Milwaukee Braves in April 1953, spending most of that season with the Lincoln Chiefs of the Class A Western League. Then, on December [[·íø6]], 1953, he was traded to Pittsburgh along with [[thir‘Å]] [[baseÔΩçan]] [[Sd]] Gordon, outfielder Sam Jethroe, pitcher Max Surkont, fellow minor leaguers Curt Raydon and Larry Lasalle, and $100,000 for third baseman Danny [[O`Connell]]. This is the only [[—ïix-for-one]] trade in [[Majo‚≤Ö]] League history and was surpassed only by the seven-for-one deal that sent Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics to the San Francisco Giants in 1978. [[W…ëters]] appeared in two games in relief for the Pirates at the end of the [[195∆º]] season, then worked in 23 games for the Pirates over the last three months of 1956 after his recall from the Open-Classification Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Both of his MLB victories came in starting roles. His first big-league triumph came on July 26, when he went seven shutout innings against the Chicago Cubs, allowing only four singles and three bases on balls. Howie Pollet relieved Waters in the eighth inning with two runners on base, and preserved the 4‚Äì0 shutout win. Over his 25 Major League games and 56 innings pitched, Waters allowed 55 hits and compiled a strong 2.89 career earned run average. However, he issued 32 bases on balls, with only 14 strikeouts. Waters appeared in only seven minor league games in 1958 and sat out the 1959 season completely. He became a high school baseball coach in Pensacola, Florida. But in 1960, at age 33, he returned to baseball as a pitcher-coach for the Class D Pensacola Angels of the Alabama‚ÄìFlorida League. In three seasons with Pensacola's professional franchise, he appeared in 73 games, largely as a starting pitcher, and compiled a 41‚Äì13 record and a sparkling 2.04 earned run average. In 1964, Waters became a manager and coach in the farm system of the Minnesota Twins, while continuing his high school coaching duties in Pensacola. During Waters' 22 seasons as a manager, all of them in short-season leagues (Rookie and Short Season-A levels), his teams went 681‚Äì664 (.505). Waters retired from managing after the 1986 season, and died in Pensacola three years later at the age of 62.",0

"No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment is a [[field]] [[squadron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air [[Force]]. [[Its]] mission is protection of RAF [[bases]] from [[ground]] attack.

[[Its]] [[initial]] role was as a rifle squadron, protecting RAF facilities from ground attack. In 1955 it changed to the light [[anti-aircraft]] role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. In [[1964]] the [[squadron]] [[reformed]], switching back to the [[rifle]] role, at the [[RAF]] Regiment Depot. [[The]] first assignments of the unit after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook internal [[security]] [[roles]]. [[After]] Rhodesia [[unilaterally]] [[declared]] independence in 1965 it was [[sent]] to Africa to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. After [[returning]] to Catterick the unit's next [[deployment]] was back to [[Aden]] in the immediate period before the [[British]] withdrawal from there in 1967. Its [[service]] in [[Aden]] was [[mainly]] spent at the [[many]] isolated airfields dotting that [[colony]]. In [[1968]] the squadron shifted bases with a move to [[RAF]] Wittering.

The British were victorious when [[Concorde]] was overhauled and [[captured]]. Captain [[Charles]] [[Inglis]] was given command of a squadron of four [[ships]] cruising independently in the West Indies. [[The]] squadron, consisting of [[HMS]] St Albans, the 64-gun Prudent, the 74-gun [[HMS]] Magnificent under [[Captain]] Robert Linzee and the [[sloop]] HMS [[Barbados]], had arrived in [[St]]. Lucia.

"[[Jerry]] [[Allen]] Walker ([[born]] [[February]] [[12]], [[1939]] in [[Ada]], [[Oklahoma]]) is a [[former]] right-handed [[pitcher]] in [[American]] [[Major]] League Baseball who [[performed]] for the [[Baltimore]] Orioles, Kansas [[City]] Athletics and [[Cleveland]] Indians between 1957 and 1964. [[During]] his career, he stood 6 [[feet]] 1 inch (1.85 m) [[tall]] and [[weighed]] [[195]] pounds (88 [[kg]]). He [[signed]] with Baltimore as a \""bonus baby\"" out of Ada's Byng High School on June [[28]], 1957. A [[member]] of the Orioles' fabled \""Kiddie [[Corps]]\"" of young pitchers signed in the late [[1950s]] ([[others]] [[included]] Milt Pappas, [[Steve]] Barber and Chuck Estrada), Walker is one of a very few [[players]] to have gone [[straight]] to the [[Major]] Leagues [[without]] ever [[playing]] a game in the minor [[leagues]]. In his [[debut]], on July [[6]], 1957, against the Boston [[Red]] Sox, he failed to retire a [[batter]], [[issuing]] bases on balls to [[Mickey]] [[Vernon]] and [[Jackie]] [[Jensen]], then uncorking a wild pitch. [[Walker]] then was lifted from the [[game]], but both runners scored, giving Walker an [[earned]] run average of [[infinity]] [[coming]] out of his [[first]] MLB game. [[However]], he was [[consistently]] more effective as the [[season]] [[progressed]], and [[threw]] a four-hit, [[complete]] [[game]] shutout against the [[Washington]] Senators on September 4, [[beating]] Camilo Pascual 1‚Äì0 for his [[first]] big-league victory. He also [[became]] the [[youngest]] [[pitcher]] [[ever]] to start a Major League [[Baseball]] All-Star [[game]] when, at age 20, he went to mound for the [[American]] League in the [[second]] All-Star [[contest]] of 1959. [[Walker]] went [[three]] [[innings]] and allowed one [[run]] on two [[hits]] and one base on balls, and was [[credited]] with the win in a 5‚Äì3 AL victory at Los Angeles Memorial [[Coliseum]].

[[The]] [[final]] was [[contested]] by [[Brazil]], who were the [[defending]] champions having won the [[previous]] FIFA World Cup [[four]] [[years]] earlier in 1994, and the [[host]] [[nation]] France, who had reached the final of the tournament for the first time.France won the match 3‚Äì0 to claim the World Cup for the first time, with the timing of the match two [[days]] before [[Bastille]] Day adding to the significance of the victory.

[[642]]‚Äì[[652]]) and [[Second]] ([[ca]]. 722‚Äì[[737]]) [[Arab]]‚ÄìKhazar Wars, but the [[Arab]]‚ÄìKhazar military [[confrontation]] [[involved]] [[several]] [[sporadic]] raids and [[isolated]] clashes as [[well]], over a period from the middle of the 7th century to the end of the [[8th]] [[century]]. The Arab‚Äì[[Khazar]] [[wars]] were a result of the attempts of the [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]] to [[secure]] [[control]] of [[Transcaucasia]] and the North Caucasus, where the [[Khazars]] were [[already]] [[established]]. [[The]] [[first]] [[Arab]] [[invasion]], in the [[640s]] and [[early]] [[650s]], ended with the defeat of an [[Arab]] force [[led]] by [[Abd]] [[ar-Rahman]] ibn Rabiah [[outside]] the [[Khazar]] [[town]] of Balanjar. Hostilities [[broke]] out again with the [[Caliphate]] in the [[710s]], with [[raids]] back and forth across the Caucasus. Led by the [[distinguished]] generals [[al-Jarrah]] ibn Abdallah and Maslama ibn [[Abd]] al-Malik, the Arabs were able to capture Derbent and even the southern [[Khazar]] capital of Balanjar, but this had [[little]] impact on the nomadic Khazars, who remained able to [[launch]] [[devastating]] raids deep into [[Transcaucasia]]. In one such raid in 730, the [[Khazars]] [[inflicted]] a major defeat on the [[Umayyad]] forces at the Battle of Ardabil, killing al-Jarrah, but were in [[turn]] defeated the [[next]] year and [[pushed]] [[back]] north. Maslama then [[recovered]] [[Derbent]], which became a [[major]] [[Arab]] [[military]] outpost and colony, before being replaced by [[Marwan]] [[ibn]] Muhammad (the [[future]] caliph [[Marwan]] II) in 732. A period of relatively localized [[warfare]] followed until [[737]], when Marwan led [[north]] a [[massive]] expedition that [[reached]] the Khazar capital Atil on the [[Volga]]. After [[securing]] some form of submission by the [[khagan]], the [[Arabs]] withdrew. The [[737]] [[campaign]] marked the end of [[large-scale]] warfare between the two powers, establishing [[Derbent]] as the northernmost Muslim [[outpost]] and securing Muslim [[dominance]] over Transcaucasia. At the same time, the [[long]] wars weakened the Umayyad army and contributed to the [[eventual]] fall of the dynasty to the [[Abbasid]] Revolution a few [[years]] later. Relations between the Muslims of the Caucasus and the Khazars remained largely peaceful thereafter, apart from [[two]] Khazar raids in the 760s and in 799, resulting from failed efforts to secure a marriage alliance between the Arab governors or local princes of the Caucasus and the Khazar khagan. Occasional warfare continued in the region between the Khazars and the local Muslim principalities of the Caucasus until the collapse of the Khazar state in the late 10th century, but the great wars of the 8th century were never repeated.","[[Te]] Arab‚ÄìKhazar [[war—ï]] were a [[serie—ï]] of [[conflict—ï]] [[foughùöù]] between the [[armie—ï]] of the Khazar [[K’∞aganate]] and the Umayyad Caliphate (as [[wel‚Öº]] as its Abbasid successor) and their [[respecti—µe]] vassals.
