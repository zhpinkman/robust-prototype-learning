"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic [[rock]] [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"".

"[[Perfect]] [[Records]] was a United States-based [[record]] [[label]] founded in 1922 by Pathé Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many [[issues]] of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to [[record]] performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.",0

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the [[line]] were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the [[line]] in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

"The Raving Loony Green Giant [[Party]] was a political [[party]] in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1989 by former members of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party (OMRLP) after clashes between them and other members of the party over direction and party activities – in particular with regard to how the party should win votes at elections. The final straw was some leading figures in the OMRLP attending only the start and finish of a charity walk for the media call, rather than attending the whole event. The party stood candidates in the Mid Staffordshire by-election, 1990 and the Ribble Valley by-election, 1991, where they finished behind the OMRLP, and in the 1992 general election. It was at a local level that the party was far more successful, and their insistence on fighting a proper election campaign (many OMRLP candidates' campaigns consisted of little more than their names appearing on the ballot paper) resulted in some notable successes. The party managed to stand a full slate of candidates for the Cannock Chase District Council elections in Staffordshire in 1990. Leader Stuart Hughes was elected to East Devon District Council and to Sidmouth Town Council in 1991 (along with another RLGGP candidate, Stuart Greenwood), and David and June Beesley were elected in Ribble Valley. In 1993, Hughes was elected to Devon County Council, representing the Sidmouth Rural ward. The party also had half a councilor on Johnstone Community Council in Scotland, who disagreed with the split and stood as a joint candidate with the OMRLP – the candidate also wished to highlight the duplicity of a number of individuals that were holding clandestine membership of each and waiting to see which \""Loony\"" faction came out on top. Screaming Lord Sutch of the OMRLP and Hughes of the RLGGP are said to have found having a joint councillor for two warring factions hilarious, Alan Hope less so.
