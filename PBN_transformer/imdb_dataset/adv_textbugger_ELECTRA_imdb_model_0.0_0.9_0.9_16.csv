"One of the greatest [[lessons]] I [[ever]] had in how to watch a [[movie]] happened this [[way]]: <br /><[[br]] />I was [[working]] in Roger Corman's offices, [[like]] so many other [[wanabees]] before and since, I was interning and [[trying]] to [[figure]] out how it all worked and how to [[make]] myself indispensable ([[hah]]!). One afternoon Julie [[Corman]], Roger Corman's [[wife]] and a [[producer]] in her own right, asked me to [[load]] up a tape. [[I'm]] not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show [[reel]], something like that, some sort of calling [[card]]. Whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the [[time]] happened to be in the [[room]] I was working in, and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the tape.<[[br]] /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a [[desk]] facing the [[camera]]. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the [[far]] wall was a coat [[rack]]. A [[second]] character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts [[pans]] or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The [[second]] character turned to hang his coat on the [[coat]] rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman [[said]] ""I've seen enough."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an [[idiot]]. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Nope, sorry. [[Next]]! That's how long you've got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are [[dead]].<br /><br />I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this piece of [[crap]]. After an interminably [[long]] travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is boring! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the [[two]] men -<[[br]] /><br />- and the director crosses the line.<br /><br />The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. Audiences don't like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. Audiences love all of those. Confused? No. You loose them. They walk out. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those things they pound into you at film school, or should. It's basic stuff. It's not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.<br /><br />I thought, ""I've seen enough"".

"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, [[wacky]] moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music throughout but that's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If whoever is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases (I believe Columbia released it) takes polls for new releases this gets my vote.","In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected.

"It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty poor films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film ""artsy and profound""--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE [[waste]] of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! <br /><br />By the way, there was one segment of this [[tedious]] [[film]] that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film.

"I'm rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent, if provocative, idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship, but one (if I can judge by the real-life [[examples]] I've known) is [[extremely]] deep and loving.<br /><[[br]] />However, the [[film]] is [[cheaply]] [[scripted--poorly]] [[scripted--and]] although it has a number of very pretty-looking shots, I didn't find it to be anything special.<br /><br />Probably the [[biggest]] problem is that it is far too short and poorly-composed to give its audience time enough to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don't really care about any of them, and so their stresses and obstacles don't really touch us.<br /><br />I think a REMAKE--from the screenplay up--with some character development by some really good writers--could improve it greatly.

Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy.

Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.<br /><br />5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6.

"I have yet to [[watch]] [[STARCRASH]] (1979) - that notoriously [[cheesy]] Italian [[take]] on [[STAR]] WARS ([[1977]]) - but it [[can't]] be [[much]] [[worse]] than this [[misbegotten]] piece of [[junk]] which, suffice it to say, [[makes]] [[Mel]] Brooks' [[so-so]] SPACEBALLS ([[1987]]) [[look]] [[like]] a [[veritable]] work of art! In fact, the [[main]] reason why GALAXINA is [[remembered]] at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its [[leading]] [[lady]] - [[Playboy]] centerfold [[Dorothy]] Stratten who was killed by her insanely [[jealous]] estranged husband - before the [[film]] had [[even]] had its official premiere! <br /><[[br]] />[[Although]] Statten (who [[subsequently]] had [[two]] [[biopics]] [[made]] about her wherein she was [[portrayed]] by [[Jamie]] Lee Curtis and Mariel [[Hemingway]]) [[plays]] the [[title]] role, for the [[first]] half of the film she is [[reduced]] to being [[propped]] up in a [[chair]] [[ostensibly]] driving a spaceship on a [[27-year]] journey to some planet or other; in fact, [[Galaxina]] is an [[all-purpose]] android who also serves the wacky crew their [[snacks]], gets them all hot under the collar and [[even]] [[goes]] scouting for the Blue [[Star]] (cue [[choral]] music) once they [[land]]! [[Having]] [[said]] that, Statten [[certainly]] looks luminous in her [[white]] attire and, even if her role hardly [[demands]] [[much]] exertion of any acting talent she [[might]] possess, it's not [[exactly]] [[demeaning]] either.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Still, it's ironic that for a film which [[bears]] her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and [[would-be]] zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the [[annoying]] Captain Cornelius [[Butt]] (which gives you the idea of the [[level]] of comedy on display here), a [[long-eared]], wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively [[speaking]]) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this s**t?""

"Last week on Friday, I went to see ""Snakes on a Plane"" with my friends. It was amazing compared to this horrible film (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically, some woman has a Mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside of they're victims. The girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. On the title screen it says ""100 Passengers... 3,000 Venemous Vipers!"" Scary, I know. There weren't even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. It's worth the five bucks to [[see]] the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though.

[[After]] [[achieving]] modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home ([[1943]]),' young Elizabeth [[Taylor]], age 12, [[landed]] her [[first]] [[leading]] role as Velvet Brown, a [[passionate]] schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though [[filmed]] in [[California]], the [[story]] - [[adapted]] from a [[novel]] by Enid [[Bagnold]] - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the [[Technicolor]] photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet [[reawakens]] his [[sense]] of [[dignity]] and [[opens]] a new, optimistic chapter in his [[life]]. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that [[led]] to his [[fear]] of horses, Rooney is [[enjoyable]] as the surly but [[passionate]] young [[man]] who must prove his worth.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />It is perhaps a [[good]] [[thing]] that Elizabeth [[Taylor]] had those [[entrancing]] violet [[eyes]], because her acting [[abilities]], at this young age, were rather [[limited]]. [[Her]] more [[emotional]] sequences, in which she displays [[courage]] and [[integrity]] in the face of adversity, [[strike]] one as being rather hollow, and the [[touchingly-naive]] notion that simply ""[[believing]]"" will accomplish [[everything]] is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and [[enthusiastic]], and she works [[well]] with Mickey Rooney, who was no [[stranger]] to being a child-star. Anne [[Revere]] plays a very [[important]] role as [[Velvet's]] mother, once a [[famous]] athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I [[liked]] that Mi was not told about this until the [[film's]] final seconds, with Mrs. [[Brown]] [[correctly]] deciding that the young [[man]] would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for [[financial]] gain, as he [[would]] undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I'll wager that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.","[[Neve‚≤Ö]] [[mid]] if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a [[bt]] hackneyed and [[occasional‚Öºy]] [[unonvincing]], [[Clarenœ≤e]] Brown's equestrian [[fab‚Öºe]] is an [[e’∏dearing]] and very [[likble]] [[sto‚≤Öy]] with a [[god]] moral.

"A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the [[pickax]] underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />Make-up effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural [[slasher]] without worrying about logic or strong [[story-telling]], opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his ""dump in the woods"" scene and current unemployment status.","A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville.

Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that [[’∞e's]] been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills [[Bill`s]] lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows [[religio’Ωsly]] when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. <br /><br />One day Bill [[follow—ï]] Cobb, Alex [[H…ëw]], home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb.

"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, [[typifies]] those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. [[It's]] not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's [[undeniably]] hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what [[they're]] playing about, how it [[heals]] them.<br /><br />[[It's]] as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to [[hot]], [[raunchy]] blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time. And, my goodness, is the sound track hot.","I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan.

"[[Sharpe's]] [[Honour]] for the uninitiated, is the [[fifth]] entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English [[army]] rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and [[based]] on the [[books]] by [[Bernard]] [[Cornwell]] (which I [[strongly]] recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case, [[I'd]] recommend starting with earlier chapters like [[Sharpe's]] Eagle or [[Sharpe's]] Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in [[disarray]] from Spain, Major [[Ducos]], the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British/Spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again. When the Spanish nobles [[come]] to Wellington [[crying]] for Sharpe's [[blood]] [[though]], the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and [[soon]], he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as [[well]], there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the [[way]], fancy that.<br /><br />What this results in of course is a more [[adventure]] style approach. [[The]] concentration is less on the workings of the English military with [[Sharpe]] as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the [[countryside]], dodging [[French]] patrols, hob [[nobbing]] with the Spanish [[guerrillas]] and [[getting]] involved in [[daring]] [[escapes]] from fortified military positions. [[Sergeant]] [[Harper]], his loyal right hand [[man]] accompanies him naturally but the [[rest]] of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is [[still]] alive. Strangely enough [[though]], they [[actually]] receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the [[delivery]] of [[Harper's]] baby.<[[br]] /><br />This slightly different [[approach]] [[makes]] for an intriguing episode but is only a good [[thing]] in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the [[standard]] battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.","[[Sh…ërpe's]] [[Honor]] for the uninitiated, is the [[fifùöùh]] entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English [[arÔΩçy]] rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and [[base‘Å]] on the [[book—ï]] by [[Bernar‘Å]] [[Corn]] [[well]] (which I [[—ïtrongly]] recommend reading).

It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever. I guess that's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.<br /><br />The ""Crime Doctor"" is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast. He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving [[capers]]. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally [[lightens]] things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's. Though the story location is California, the Braggas appear to live in a castle!<br /><br />There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but I won't divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (even though I can think of many, many, B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the ""Crime Doctor"" series, so I can't make any comparisons.","It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched ""The Crime Doctor's Courage"" all the way through.

"[[Empty]] [[shortening]] of [[John]] [[Irving's]] [[novel]] [[strives]] for profundity [[courageously]] but [[ends]] up being [[absurd]].

"WEll [[first]] and for most I'd just [[like]] to [[say]] that I'm [[back]] out of retirement from [[writing]] well deserved [[comments]] about [[horrible]] [[movies]]. [[Only]] the movie in [[titled]] ""Scarecrow gone [[wild]]"" [[could]] bring me back, so here I am.<br /><[[br]] />With that being [[said]], I [[like]] to start off with this comment. [[OUCH]]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [[This]] [[movie]] was [[really]] horrible, I [[mean]] I [[know]] it was going to be [[bad]]. But I had no idea that I would be [[spending]] 60 minutes out of a possible 90 [[minute]] film laughing at what I [[thought]] was a horror [[movie]].<br /><br />Let's [[start]] with the biggest [[flaw]] of the film (to me that is). [[Ken]] [[Shamrock]]. [[Now]] if [[memory]] [[serves]] me [[correctly]], Shamrock is one of the [[worlds]] most [[dangerous]] men. [[Now]] if memory [[serves]] me again, he was also in this [[stupid]] movie being a [[stupid]] comic [[relief]] (or [[that's]] how it looked to me). I mean how else do you explain all of his lines. My all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was ""[[It's]] been a long time [[coming]]"". OK????????? The funnest [[thing]] about that line was that no more then [[five]] minutes [[prior]] to him [[say]] that, he was [[sitting]] on the beach [[talking]] to the soon to be [[dead]] [[kids]] about how the [[dam]] [[scarecrow]] could not be [[killed]]. So if he has [[knowledge]] of this, why on [[earth]] [[would]] he [[start]] [[trying]] to [[combat]] it as [[soon]] as he sees it (the [[scarecrow]] that it). [[Like]] I [[said]] before, he [[must]] have been the comic relief, [[except]] I don't think his [[UFC]] [[buddies]] where [[laughing]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Now]] that [[I've]] [[finished]] that well deserved [[paragraph]] on to the movie.<br /><br />[[I'll]] admit that I [[can't]] remember a lot of [[scenes]], and that's not [[good]] [[considering]] that I just watch the [[movie]] no more then fifteen [[minutes]] ago. So what [[I'm]] going to do is list the top [[five]] [[things]] [[wrong]] with this film [[1]]. [[Usually]] when horror [[movie]] monster have their own [[theme]] music, it's not [[heard]] by the [[victims]] or [[even]] by the [[monster]] itself. So why were just about [[every]] person [[involved]] in this [[movie]] [[able]] to here this [[pathetic]] whistling. I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, ""Den Brysomme mannen"" makes normal human interaction look like deadpan [[comedy]], as quotidian life becomes a performance, which [[transforms]] Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

"[[After]] repeatedly saying how [[brilliant]] so many [[Columbo]] [[episodes]] are, it's [[time]] to [[honour]] an [[episode]] with [[maximum]] points. ""Etude In Black"" is not [[100]] percent [[perfect]], but it's certainly more than [[90]] percent...maybe [[96]] or [[97]]! <[[br]] /><[[br]] />Last week I [[reviewed]] ""Just Married"" and [[compared]] it unfavourably to ""[[Meet]] The Parents"". Well [[here's]] one of the parents, [[Blythe]] [[Danner]], in a much earlier role as the wife of [[famous]] orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the [[legend]] that is [[John]] [[Cassavetes]]. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a [[girl]] in the [[orchestra]] (not his first affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert [[hall]] before a [[performance]] and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some [[top-notch]] extra [[characters]], ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"[[For]] me, [[reviewing]] movies is an extension of my [[love]] of film--and of horror cinema, in particular.

"I am a [[glutton]] for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. It is cheezy. It is gory. It has no real plot, but it [[entertained]] me for an hour and a half. I was either [[laughing]] or covering my eyes in shock. There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I [[loved]] the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. Don't expect Romero, just second-rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it, and it is [[funny]] and cheezy and a fast ride through B-movie Land.","I am a [[gluùöùton]] for B-movies.

"A [[film]] that [[reveals]] the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. What's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. Post modernism had not reached Hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. One has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was [[victimized]] and [[bullied]] in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so na√Øve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. The film though is interesting but in something quite different. The setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, [[morbid]], [[decadent]], quite in the style of ""Death in Venice"" or [[Greenaway]], or some other [[works]] of [[art]] that deal with making friends with the basic [[enemy]] that [[death]] is.

"This is one of those strange, [[self-important]], [[self-indulgent]] movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. [[Instead]], it spouts [[cliches]] that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others.

"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*<br /><br />I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast [[foward]] to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), [[John's]] daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie [[Croker]] (who was actually indirectly responsible for her [[father's]] death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that [[they've]] found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the [[teamgets]] back together, along with getting the [[help]] of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to [[carry]] out the perfect [[heist]], while creating one of the largest traffic jams in [[Los]] Angeles history. This movie is a [[perfect]] [[mix]] of action with [[funny]] bits thrown in throughout. [[There's]] an [[on-running]] joke about Seth [[Green's]] character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""[[Napster]]"". There's even a [[funny]] [[line]] in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

"[[The]] [[first]] [[time]] I saw ""Alice in Wonderland ¬ñ an X-rated Musical [[Comedy]]"", was in the [[early]] '[[80]] in a [[Movie-Theater]] in N.Y. City with some [[friends]]. I [[remember]] we [[actually]] [[enjoyed]] it very much, [[although]] we were left [[wondering]] why all the ""goodies"" were [[covered]] by in various [[forms]] [[shaped]] colored patches and why the movie was [[suddenly]] [[jumping]] from one scene to the next one, leaving [[us]] [[guessing]]...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) version, which [[left]] me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its [[original]] [[integral]] version. [[Well]], more then 20 [[years]] [[went]] by, during which I forgot all about this movie and, only a few days [[ago]], by [[sheer]] chance, I stumbled upon a [[heavily]] used [[VHS]] [[copy]] (which had [[seen]] [[better]] times: a [[bit]] washed-out colors, scratchy [[sound]] and a few [[flaws]]), but [[guess]] what? It's the original uncut version and, this [[time]], I [[really]] had a [[ball]]! Humor, Musical and [[Porn]] [[may]] [[sound]] an [[awkward]] [[combination]] but, in this [[case]], it [[really]] [[works]] and, unlikely the big majority of boring [[porn-flicks]] [[nowadays]] invading our screens, this is a [[really]] amusing and [[entertaining]] sex [[fantasy]], which will not [[disappoint]] you. The direction is clever, the [[swift]] [[editing]] [[makes]] the movie [[fly]] [[like]] a [[bird]], all the familiar characters are lovable or just [[plain]] funny, all the actors seem having a [[good]] [[time]], the songs are [[catchy]] ([[worth]] mentioning the one about ""growing up"" sung by [[Alice]] at the beginning of the [[movie]] and the [[hilarious]] ""What's a [[nice]] girl like you doing on a [[Knight]] like this""), the [[dance]] [[numbers]] are [[well]] [[choreographed]] and staged ([[amazingly]] energetic [[Terry]] Hall proves that she can ""also"" dance and dances enthusiastically her guts [[away]]...Don't [[worry]], she also does what she was [[best]] known for...), the acting, the singing, the set, the [[costumes]] are of [[quality]] level and then...there is [[Kristine]] ""Blue [[Eyes]]"" DeBell, in the [[first]] starring [[role]] of her career and (oh boy!) she indeed has a few H.C. sequences! Personally I think they are absolutely not [[distasteful]], on the [[contrary]], they are [[spontaneous]] and quite arousing. She is young and (ohhh!) so very pretty; with the help of her [[new]] friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality so, she sings, she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of very good time (perhaps also an after-show extra action...) This is ""Adult Entertainment"" so be careful, don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. If your 10 years old can put his hands on it, he might amuse himself, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why ""this"" Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he watched on the Disney's video. I bet, you will not forget this ""one-of-a-kind"" very soon. It's a real shame that they don't mak'em like that anymore...!

She is young and (ohhh!) so very pretty; with the help of her [[n]] [[ew]] friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality so, she sings, she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of very good time (perhaps also an after-show extra action...) This is ""Adult Entertainment"" so be careful, don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. If your 10 years old can put his hands on it, he might amuse himself, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why ""this"" Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he watched on the Disney's video. I bet, you will not forget this ""one-of-a-kind"" very soon. It's a real shame that they don't mak'em like that anymore...! I give it a 9 out of 10.",1

"Eisenstein's first [[sound]] [[film]] retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the [[Livonian]] [[knights]], eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in [[1938]], Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the [[Germanic]] knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in [[delicate]] black and white ([[somewhat]] reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it [[also]] marked [[Eisenstein's]] return to official favor. By the [[late]] [[1920s]], Stalin [[wanted]] [[Soviet]] filmmakers to [[stop]] experimentation and [[made]] movies that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. That stopped [[Eisenstein's]] career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he [[came]] back with his more [[accessible]] film. Nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie [[history]]: never before (and probably never after) a [[battle]] would be so vivid in the [[screen]]. [[Another]] strong point is Prokofiev's [[beautiful]], [[haunting]] [[soundtrack]] (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). One of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton Russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful Russian peasant) is really jarring.","Eisenstein's first [[soun‘Å]] [[filÔΩç]] retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the [[L]] [[ivonian]] [[knight—ï]], eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism.

[[The]] camera [[shots]] of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and [[makeup]]. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to.

What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined.

"I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book either Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the very [[interested]] film. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend, Charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because of Charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang [[leaded]] by Manny Franker. After some altercation during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the New York City in the hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time, everywhere and everyday. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker who know his profile well and like him very much. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang.<br /><br />I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action film which I had seen from the past. This movie used the very straightedge [[way]] to [[tell]] the story. [[No]] [[ponderous]] story-telling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. I believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the crude, extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie, especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of Manny Franker which I thought that it was the [[maximum]] action scene.<br /><br />For about the cast, I think everyone was good and get through their role. Charles Bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the ""big old cat"", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very good. His main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by Franker and his follower to make a heat on Paul Kersey. She could have more role to appear.<br /><br />For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this [[movie]] [[great]] for extreme action film fans. Fast-paced with back and Forth style made this movie very interested to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money. Haha! that's like a joke! Although, I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey.<br /><br />In another case, the ending scene of the movie set back me. It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him. I thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Film's movie, but I dislike it.<br /><br />For the summary, I am OK with Death Wish 3 due to my explanation I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even it had some scene I don't like.

"[[Pixote]] is directed with barely a shred of [[sentimentality]]. And yet I more than imagine Hector [[Babenco]] owes some of his film-making [[chops]] with this film to Vittorio De Sica's neo-realist style, in particular Shoeshine (that film, as with Pixote, takes place mostly inside a children's prison). And yet while I might still prefer De Sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is, no pun intended, like choosing between two children. [[They're]] both [[marvelous]] works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war. This is how it was in Brazil- one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in City of God, perhaps in some of the same locations- and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made. Some aren't alive some 20+ years later, for all anyone knows.<br /><br />The ""star"", pre-teen street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him, and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. [[The]] conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as [[two]] children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. There's a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the film we find Pixote with a few other youths, including Lilica a practical transvestite not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever to get by. None of this, I should repeat, is shown with a kind of ham-fisted earnestness- certainly you would never in a million years see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis direct this kind of picture- and yet there's an [[emotional]] honesty to everything exactly because [[nothing]] is trivialized.<br /><br />Nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for Pixote, and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn, and so without even reaching puberty yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older (though not by much at all) and become things that will haunt this person forever. Despite Babenco's usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels forced. As with De Sica, maybe more-so given the consistent conditions of San Paolo and Rio street kids, he's a natural director of children, and coax's out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of ""cinematic"" drama (that is not so real that it becomes documentary, which isn't a bad thing per-say) and even subtlety in some scenes.<br /><br />Pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century Brazilian films that look back on the horrors of Rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be.

"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* <br /><br />-""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past.<br /><br />-Director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does an [[excellent]] job with this movie considering its uber low budget. It hand-held and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it. The actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it. The standout feature in the movie is of course Carla Gugino who bares it all in this movie. She is actually more nude in this movie than she is in ""Sin City"". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless, but he is fun to watch. I didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got. The movie is R rated and it's that for a very good reason. it's very sexual and very graphic at times. It's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there. Although there is one pointless scene where we see Chris McDonald getting it on, that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem I guess. The only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something <br /><br />-It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since this. This is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget. I really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director.

"I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max. After having viewed Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I have to say that the 'uncut' DVD version was both great and disappointing. The U.S. version is so *much* better than the DVD (European?) version. The U.S. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible. Feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact one ""new"" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when Caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. I love this scene, in the U.S. version though. On the DVD, the male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. It's the pinnacle of hilarity:<br /><br />""It'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!"" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. I was floored when I saw this. It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. I'm glad Hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made for the U.S. version that make Lifeforce that much [[better]] and I wished the DVD had the U.S. version. The editing is [[sharp]] and frenzied [[without]] being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the U.S. version are even more boring on the DVD version because of added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the U.S. version. More subtle.<br /><br />I [[love]] this film. It's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much Lifeforce as possible. The film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to London, it's [[fun]]. The [[film]] really [[shines]] in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They're the best Apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. It's also the best zombie movie ever. The zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. Not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. Also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />And to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />As for the DVD, well, it ain't great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp U.S. version on a DVD, and with commentary by Hooper and Dykstra.","I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max.

"The [[Golden]] [[Door]] is the [[story]] of a [[Sicilian]] family's [[journey]] from the [[Old]] [[World]] ([[Italy]]) to the [[New]] World (America). [[Salvatore]], a middle-aged [[man]] who [[hopes]] for a more fruitful life, persuades his [[family]] to [[leave]] their homeland [[behind]] in [[Sicily]], take the arduous journey [[across]] the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose [[rivers]] supposedly flow with milk. In [[short]], they believe that by [[risking]] everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, [[clever]] and highly imaginative. Silver [[coins]] rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the [[New]] [[World]]; carrots and [[onions]] [[twice]] the size of human beings are shown being [[harvested]] to [[suggest]] wealth and [[health]], and rivers of [[milk]] are [[swam]] in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will [[yield]]. [[All]] of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the [[characters]] and [[helps]] [[nicely]] [[compliment]] the gritty [[realism]] that the [[story]] [[unfolds]] to the audience. The [[contrast]] between this imagery [[versus]] the dark [[reality]] of the [[Sicilian]] [[people]] [[helps]] [[provide]] hope while they're aboard the [[ship]] to the [[New]] World.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[The]] [[voyage]] to the [[New]] World is [[shot]] [[almost]] in complete darkness, [[especially]] when the seas tempests [[roar]] and [[nearly]] kill the people [[within]]. The [[dark]] reality I referred to is the Old [[World]] and the [[journey]] itself to the [[New]] [[World]]. The [[Old]] World is [[depicted]] as [[somewhat]] [[destitute]] and primitive. This is shown as [[Salvatore]] scrambles [[together]] to [[sell]] what few possessions he has [[left]] (donkeys, [[goats]] and [[rabbits]]) in [[order]] to obtain the appropriate [[clothing]] he needs to enter the New World. I [[thought]] it was rather [[interesting]] that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress [[code]] in order to be [[accepted]] in the New World; it was [[almost]] [[suggesting]] that [[people]] had to fit a [[particular]] stereotype or [[mold]] in order to be recognized as [[morally]] fit. The most [[powerful]] image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and [[setting]] sail for the New World. This shot shows an [[overhead]] view of a crowd of people who [[slowly]] seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. [[This]] shot [[also]] suggested that the people were being [[torn]] away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their [[previous]] [[dark]] living conditions and were desirous to [[enter]] a world that [[held]] more [[promise]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[As]] later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct.

Too bad, because all the girls look ravishing and after only 10 minutes, the obligatory line ""Who needs a bathing-suit?"" is spoken.",1

"This movie used to be played constantly on the Disney Channel when I was a bit younger, and I really remember liking it. However, I didn't have great taste back then (not to say that I do now) so I can't vouch for my nine-year-old self too well.

Even having said that, much of the script was [[great]]. The characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things.

"[[Dr]].

So Nicholas together with his [[girlfriend]] Jessica ([[Chelsey]] Crisp) & three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese ([[Chase]] [[Hoyt]]) & Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) head out there for a fun [[weekend]]. [[Unfortunately]] [[things]] don't go according to plan, the [[cabin]] turns out to be [[little]] more than a [[run]] down [[shed]] & their [[neighbours]] [[turn]] out to be Dr. [[Chopper]] ([[Ed]] Brigadier) & his [[two]] nurses who go [[around]] killing [[anyone]] they [[meet]] to [[use]] them in [[horrible]] experiments...<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Going [[straight-to-video]]/DVD [[Dr]].

The script which [[takes]] itself very seriously is credited to [[Ian]] Holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the [[IMDb]] cast list although I [[can't]] remember any character of that [[name]], maybe he was one of the cops at the start? Anyway, the basic story is alright I [[suppose]] although it's a tad dull & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running [[around]] bumping off our annoying [[American]] [[teen]] cast, you know the drill by now. Besides some brief & undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using body parts to [[replenish]] his own deteriorating body [[there's]] not [[much]] story here & the script seems to exist solely to [[invent]] situations for girls to take their tops off, [[there's]] the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. Oh, & when I say topless I mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper at all. So there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clich√©d dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe I'm just being picky.<br /><br />Director Schoenburn does OK actually, this is by no means the worst looking film I've seen although it still looks cheap. There's no style here, I didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. The gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any [[particularly]] convincing special effects. [[Dr]]. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.<br /><br />Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. The acting is alright, it could have better but I've certainly seen worse.<br /><br />Dr. Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.","[[D‚≤Ö]].

Besides some brief & undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper using body parts to [[relenish]] his own deteriorating body [[the‚≤Öe's]] not [[muœ≤h]] story here & the script seems to exist solely to [[invet]] situations for girls to take their tops off, [[there'—ï]] the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. Oh, & when I say topless I mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper at all. So there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clich√©d dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe I'm just being picky.<br /><br />Director Schoenburn does OK actually, this is by no means the worst looking film I've seen although it still looks cheap. There's no style here, I didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. The gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any [[particlarly]] convincing special effects. [[D‚≤Ö]]. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.<br /><br />Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. The acting is alright, it could have better but I've certainly seen worse.<br /><br />Dr. Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.",0

"The Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the United States. Other than Crossfire(1947) and Gentleman's Agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a [[musical-theatre]] background.

The leading actors in these ""Jewish"" films were always played by non-Jews. For example Larry Parks a [[non-Jew]] played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme [[palpable]] to a mainly [[non-Jewish]] audience. The Jazz Singer(1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a [[non-practicing]] Jewess in the [[film]]. The clue to her background is when she attends the Golding's family meal before entering she says ""I haven't been to a sader (passover service) since I left home"".<br /><[[br]] />[[The]] film is about a [[cantor's]] son who has just [[left]] the [[service]] after seeing action in Korea.

The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have [[visited]]. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this film you get to see her sing ""Lover"" and ""Just One of Those Things"" [[wonderful]]. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very [[well]]. [[The]] comedic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing.

The leading actors in these ""Jewish"" films were always played by non-Jews. For example Larry Parks a [[non-Je‘ù]] played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme [[paplable]] to a mainly [[no-Jewish]] audience. The Jazz Singer(1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a [[non-practiœ≤ing]] Jewess in the [[filÔΩç]]. The clue to her background is when she attends the Golding's family meal before entering she says ""I haven't been to a sader (passover service) since I left home"".<br /><[[b‚≤Ö]] />[[Te]] film is about a [[cantor`s]] son who has just [[let]] the [[serviœ≤e]] after seeing action in Korea.

This [[filÔΩç]] was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy [[whtichhunts]] and the Hollywood [[black]] [[list]]. Therefore in this film the Jews are shown as [[god]] [[loya‚Öº]] citizens and<[[b‚≤Ö]] /><br />are [[quintessentia‚Öºy]] [[Ameriœ≤an]]. [[Te]] [[—ïynagogue]] choir [[woul‘Å]] rather play baseball than practice. The [[cantor—ï]] [[friend—ï]] [[al—ïo]] talk about baseball in [[fat]] one of them is a [[Majo‚≤Ö]] League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have [[visite‘Å]]. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this film you get to see her sing ""Lover"" and ""Just One of Those Things"" [[wonderfu‚Öº]]. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very [[wel‚Öº]]. [[Te]] comedic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.",1

"We'll never see this movie broadcast by HBO in the near future if at all.

Still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the World Trade Center to happen.

Still it took another eight years to realize that we should have learned from that first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and far more devastating assault on the World Trade Center to happen.

"I [[love]] this movie. At first, I didn't expect much of this movie since I didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres.

"GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a bit better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN. Although this film isn't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, I did find BEAUTY to be a little stronger and better put together all-the-way-around than VIRGIN...but then again, that's not really saying much.<br /><br />BEAUTY starts off as a pretty rough and straight-faced exploit film. A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion. As this nastiness is going on, the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa, and that they're gonna do the same to her. They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. She somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story. The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the young lady's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan backfires, so now Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (some pretty rough butt-rape ensues along with the pre-requisite gang rape...). She too is drugged, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly hapless victim ----- it turns her into a raging hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON!!! (no sh!t, that's what really happens!!!) This is when BEAUTY really [[takes]] off with some pretty f!cking insane kill scenes - including a very [[classy]] chest-burst-rape that looks like a cross between ALIEN and a bad porn, and my favorite - a head-engulfed-by-demon-vagina kill (complete with demon vagina-slime...)that has to be seen to be believed...<br /><br />Definitely some [[promising]] stuff going on in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still very disjointed feeling. BEAUTY almost feels like two different films being forced together in a non-compatible way. Still, I have to give the film credit - the rape scenes are very rough and misogynistic, and the kill scenes are just totally off the wall.

"This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave). Naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.<br /><br />But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look like classics. This disaster movie IS a disaster, and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.<br /><br />The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain [[bores]].<br /><br />If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.<br /><br />Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.<br /><br />If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.<br /><br />Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.","This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu.

"It plays like your usual teenage-audience T&A movie, but the sentiment is incredibly bleak. If it was made today, it'd be considered an art house movie. It goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid, but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The whole teen flick formula is adhered to, but nothing turns out the way you'd expect.

"Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The [[actors]] gave excellent [[performances]] and the [[plot]] is [[excellent]]. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary.

"Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" [[clich√©]] horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the [[film]] fails [[miserably]].<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance.

[[But]] [[HERE]] -- I not only didn't care for the story or other aspects, but I found Angela's squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the MOST [[ANNOYING]] presence in any movie (or presentation in any other [[media]]) I've ever experienced. It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally ""over-the top"" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of ""My Fair Lady."" But that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of ""relativity"" at work.) If I hadn't been with friends, with the necessity to remain, MY viewing would have been brief.

It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally ""over-the top"" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of ""My Fair Lady."" But that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of ""relativity"" at work.)

"It's now 2005 and 15+ years since this [[cartoon]] first aired. I haven't [[actually]] [[watched]] it [[seriously]] or [[closely]] in about 10 years. [[Now]] that I'm an adult in my 30s I can look [[back]] with a [[serious]] [[eye]] as I [[watch]] the [[episodes]] again.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />In [[concept]], the cartoon is [[partly]] an [[homage]] to the classic Looney Tunes but also its own original show. There are a few episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. For example, there is a singer that attacks Buster and so he exacts [[revenge]] on this singer's concert -[[exactly]] like the old [[Bugs]] Bunny cartoon. The ensuing cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, just in a different era. If you [[look]] at the [[old]] Looney Tunes, they did an awful [[lot]] of [[stuff]] [[exactly]] [[like]] Tiny Toons did. The [[old]] Looney Tunes [[made]] a [[lot]] of [[social]] [[commentary]] and [[parody]]. [[There]] were celebrity impersonations. There were a lot of corny [[period]] [[jokes]], [[slang]], and dialog. The [[comedy]] was [[surreal]] and wacky. [[You]] can [[say]] this exactly for Tiny Toons as [[well]]. The comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this show. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. But the [[reason]] we don't think Looney Tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. [[Also]], Looney Tunes was [[original]] back in those days but today [[cartoons]] are rehashed over and over. So it's [[easy]] to [[perceive]] Tiny Toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.<br /><br />There certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being made for kids watching TV. Even so, they did a [[good]] [[job]] making an original show with original gags AND still paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old Looney Tunes.<br /><br />Since Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.","It's now 2005 and 15+ years since this [[carùöùoon]] first aired.

For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.",1

"Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the [[director's]] finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, '[[Acrobatty]] Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody, he [[hollers]] ""Pinocchio"" down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come.

Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny', 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion, '[[Acobatty]] Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset, not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody, he [[ho]] [[llers]] ""Pinocchio"" down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come.

"[[This]] is a [[good]] [[episode]], but it's not my [[favorite]]. A lot of people [[love]] it and on a [[creative]] level it's [[brilliant]]. [[Most]] of the [[episode]] has no [[dialog]], which is such a [[cool]] [[idea]] and ""[[Hush]]"" [[handles]] the silence [[really]] [[well]]. [[Plus]], this episode [[introduces]] [[Tara]], who I [[like]] a [[lot]]. [[But]], I don't like Riely or the [[Initative]] or Maggie [[Walsh]] and they [[seem]] to [[get]] a [[lot]] of screen [[time]] in ""[[Hush]]."" Plus, I don't [[think]] the Gentlemen are that scary and I get tired of [[watching]] the float [[around]] [[Sunnydale]]. I know that I'm in the minority, but I tend to fast-forward parts of ""Hush."" [[Of]] course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you're watching on [[DVD]], I [[recommend]] seeing this [[episode]]. It really is a [[classic]].<[[br]] /><br />""[[Hush]]"" [[revolves]] around the entire town losing their voices. [[Skelatal]] looking demon-guys [[called]] the Gentlemen arrive to gather seven [[hearts]] from human victims, but if they [[hear]] a human scream they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in [[town]]. Buffy and the Scoobies try to figure out [[what's]] going on, while the [[Initative]] [[also]] [[start]] [[investigating]]. Meanwhile, Xander [[comes]] to [[realize]] how [[much]] Anya means to him and Willow meets a fellow [[witch]] named Tara. Buffy and [[Riely]] finally come face to [[face]] while fighting the [[Gentlemen]]. They are both stunned about what they learn... He's a commando and she's the Slayer. In the end Buffy saves the day, but she now has to deal with her [[new]] knowledge of [[Riely's]] secret life.<br /><br />Really, the creativity of ""Hush"" can't be [[seen]] in a basic [[outline]] of its plot. [[It's]] the overwhelming silence of the episode, that makes it so [[great]]. The characters try to communicate in [[different]] [[ways]], ([[White-out]] boards, pantomime, obscene finger [[gestures]], etc...) and it all just [[works]] [[really]] well. After a while you [[forget]] that there's no dialog because they're all so [[good]] at [[expressing]] themselves. During the ""talking"" parts of the episode, there are a lot of references to the importance of really ""[[hearing]]"" each other. Anya claims that Xander won't really [[talk]] to her. [[Giles]] ignores Spike and Xander's protests and insists that Spike move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly substitutes the word ""petroleum"" for ""patrolling"" when she talks to Riely so she won't have to explain her calling. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all pretty cool.<br /><br />There are a lot of good parts to this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the Initatives' elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. Also I like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out.<br /><br />On the downside, I don't understand how the Gentlemen are choosing their victims. They just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. [[Also]], I don't like Riely. I've never liked him, but from ""Hush"" on I'm pretty much just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Giles' ""Who are the Gentlemen?"" lecture to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious. He makes some similar looking flashcards in season seven's ""First Date."" Pretty much anytime Giles starts drawing monsters, it's just gonna be fun.","[[Tis]] is a [[g–æod]] [[episod–µ]], but it's not my [[favoriùöùe]].

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly [[ill-timed]] given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.","If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd.

"I give ""[[Flashdance]]"" a [[lowest]] [[rating]] of [[1]] out of 10 because it's [[nothing]] more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the [[music]] videos, in [[order]] to [[clock]] in as a feature length film. [[Since]] when does that [[count]] as film? Jennifer Beals plays [[Alex]] [[Owens]], an aspiring 18-year-old [[dancer]], who, [[incomprehensibly]], has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. [[Not]] a line of work most [[older]] [[women]] [[find]] their way into, [[much]] [[less]] [[18-year-olds]] fresh out of high [[school]]. [[Meanwhile]], at night she works as an [[exotic]] dancer, who never actually takes off her [[clothes]], in a [[greasy]] spoon bar called [[Mawby's]]. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished [[dance]] routines the girls do [[every]] night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the [[best]] casino on the Las Vegas [[Strip]].<br /><[[br]] />[[Alex]] ends up having a [[predictable]] romance with her [[boss]], Nick [[Hurley]] (Michael [[Nouri]]), who is about twice her [[age]]. After resisting [[Nick's]] advances, because going out with the boss isn't a [[good]] idea, she [[wastes]] no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no [[sense]] given how it is likely to look to [[Alex's]] [[co-workers]].<[[br]] /><br />When [[Beals]] isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her [[character]] spends most her time [[throwing]] temper [[tantrums]]. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the [[prestigious]] Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her [[boss]]/[[boyfriend]] helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her [[tantrums]]. [[She]] angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.<[[br]] /><br />Of [[course]], Alex does eventually get her audition at the [[Conservatory]]. She puts on a [[dance]] routine before the [[Conservatory]] board that is so ridiculous that you [[would]] think it was in a [[movie]] marketed to the [[MTV]] [[generation]]. Oh yeah, it is a [[dance]] routine in a movie marketed to the [[MTV]] generation.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about. Instead what we get are stock characters put in ridiculous scenes any viewer with a functioning brain can't take [[seriously]]. A truly forgettable ""film"".","I give ""[[Flashdanœ≤e]]"" a [[lowesùöù]] [[raùöùing]] of [[l]] out of 10 because it's [[noùöùhing]] more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the [[musiœ≤]] videos, in [[orde‚≤Ö]] to [[clocùíå]] in as a feature length film. [[Sinœ≤e]] when does that [[counùöù]] as film? Jennifer Beals plays [[A‚Öºex]] [[Owes]], an aspiring 18-year-old [[dance‚≤Ö]], who, [[incomprehensib‚Öºy]], has a job as a welder in a Pittsburgh steel factory. [[Noùöù]] a line of work most [[oder]] [[woÔΩçen]] [[fin‘Å]] their way into, [[muœ≤h]] [[les]] [[18-ear-olds]] fresh out of high [[schoo‚Öº]]. [[Meanwhi‚Öºe]], at night she works as an [[exotiœ≤]] dancer, who never actually takes off her [[clothe—ï]], in a [[grea—ïy]] spoon bar called [[Ma]] [[wby's]]. Yet looking at the well choreographed and well polished [[danœ≤e]] routines the girls do [[eve‚≤Öy]] night at Mawby's, you would think they were working at the [[besùöù]] casino on the Las Vegas [[St‚≤Öip]].<br /><[[b‚≤Ö]] />[[A‚Öºex]] ends up having a [[predictab‚Öºe]] romance with her [[bos—ï]], Nick [[Hur‚Öºey]] (Michael [[Nou‚≤Öi]]), who is about twice her [[ae]]. After resisting [[Nicùíå's]] advances, because going out with the boss isn't a [[god]] idea, she [[wasts]] no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no [[sen—ïe]] given how it is likely to look to [[Ale's]] [[c-workers]].<[[b‚≤Ö]] /><br />When [[Be…ëls]] isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her [[characte‚≤Ö]] spends most her time [[thro‘ùing]] temper [[tantrmus]]. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the [[prestigiou—ï]] Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her [[bos—ï]]/[[boyfrien‘Å]] helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her [[tantrms]]. [[Se]] angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.<[[–¨r]] /><br />Of [[cour—ïe]], Alex does eventually get her audition at the [[Conservato‚≤Öy]]. She puts on a [[da’∏ce]] routine before the [[Conservato‚≤Öy]] board that is so ridiculous that you [[wo’Ωld]] think it was in a [[mov—ñe]] marketed to the [[M]] [[TV]] [[generaùöùion]]. Oh yeah, it is a [[danc–µ]] routine in a movie marketed to the [[M]] [[TV]] generation.<[[–¨r]] /><[[–¨r]] />I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about.

"There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it.<br /><br />But. They did it subtly.

Not as naturally as two people would (Age no bar) but forcing them to be around each other as if they were SUPPOSED to fall in love.<br /><br />All in all, there should have been chemistry. It would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject would also have been engrossed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, no matter the impracticality.<br /><br />I found it difficult to believe Jia's character at times. What I found more difficult to understand, is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist, who seems serious - would have had an interest in a girl so frivolous. Unless he himself has some frivolousness hidden in himself, which did not come out at all.<br /><br />There is a lot of use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that might lead to something that is not right. So RGV is himself calling the relationship unnatural.<br /><br />The camera angles, background score, editing, and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbology emphasises and [[overemphasises]] their relationship. Is the Indian audience so dumb that we need to be told something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together... it was apparent what was happening. What was the need of slowing the scene down with dramatic background music?

Some may think the Gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry, the in jokes I mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but I shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since...well, I can't remember! The fans that have been 'with' the League since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the Local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, Simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise! I was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the film when I first heard about it but as a story within a story I was just getting into it when...but that would be telling! All I need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film! I am not a professional reviewer of films, so I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed this film but for now I will just say that if the supposed benchmark for British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of the Dead' then I am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive, hilarious and [[soemtimes]] a little scary...The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse.<br /><br />Jason Kenny 2005",1
"This sounded like it was going to be like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something, but it wasn't. It really was more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jump scenes. It was a little like Plan 9 From Outer Space in the sense that the main bad guy kept making [[inane]] speeches that made me want to go get a snack without pushing pause. The idea of a person who is so crazy that he would abduct people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the [[execution]] was too made-for-TV feeling. I have to say it was better than I expected for a movie written and starring Dee Snider. A good first effort. Maybe he'll learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy.","This sounded like it was going to be like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something, but it wasn't.

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.<br /><br />The original Robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those films that just can't be done again. That said, it's not surprising a sequel was made- it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has crafted an [[unpleasant]], slightly incoherent and overlong film that can't capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it tries. And it certainly does that, the funny ads from the first film running none stop, the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before, but with blood/gore even meaner than the first film. The first film earned a name for some nasty, blood-soaked violence (including a man's genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces) but while that was more memorable the violence/gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature, with a very unpleasant and mean-spirited tone to it.<br /><br />But overall, the film leaves you with a feeling of general [[apathy-]] why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead? **","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke.

"This begrudging and [[angry]] film is against not just the [[war]] during which it was [[made]], but all [[war]]. It doesn't care what [[war]] it is. [[It]] might be the most [[emotionally]] [[involving]] [[experience]] I have [[ever]] had with [[Ingmar]] Bergman's [[work]]. There are no [[sides]] to the two [[main]] characters in this [[impacting]] [[drama]], which doesn't intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per Bergman's usual, but plainly showcases people and their lives and [[exercises]] what Bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie.<br /><br />His [[top-drawer]] regulars Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an [[internalizing]] but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians. Now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. Part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work. They are not reclusive intellectuals, either. They are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical; they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. [[Ullmann]] is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. Her husband Von Sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by. Their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of a parachuting airman, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition, and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side, but [[loyalties]] have long since splintered. <br /><br />They are sent back to their home, witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage. This, one of my [[top]] [[favorite]] Bergman efforts, is a [[study]] of a couple [[jarred]] from their safely [[self-unaware]] lives and violated by a manipulative despair, testing them both to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to some extent, too self-serving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying. His suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very [[initiative]] and excitement that attracted them to begin with. The [[immense]] last twenty [[minutes]], sporadically [[interrupted]] by [[images]] of the [[overwhelming]] gray sky, are [[among]] the closest to [[real]] [[emotion]] that [[Bergman]] [[ever]] filmed.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />All [[systems]] of [[dogma]] and [[faith]] are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait.

It doesn't care what [[wa‚≤Ö]] it is. [[Iùöù]] might be the most [[emotional‚Öºy]] [[invol—µing]] [[experienœ≤e]] I have [[eve‚≤Ö]] had with [[Ingma‚≤Ö]] Bergman's [[worùíå]]. There are no [[side—ï]] to the two [[min]] characters in this [[imapcting]] [[draÔΩça]], which doesn't intimate a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per Bergman's usual, but plainly showcases people and their lives and [[exerœ≤ises]] what Bergman has already proved he understands about a person's reaction to a movie.<br /><br />His [[ùöùop-drawer]] regulars Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an [[intern…ëlizing]] but bickering married couple who were once orchestra musicians. Now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. Part of the building frustration we grow to share with these two people fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their house seems to work. They are not reclusive intellectuals, either. They are a rather familiar marriage that has more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical; they only get wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on forever. [[Ullman’∏]] is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. Her husband Von Sydow shrugs off that the war will pass them by. Their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighter planes flying low over their house, the killing of a parachuting airman, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition, and eventually their capture by what appears to be the local side, but [[loyaltie—ï]] have long since splintered. <br /><br />They are sent back to their home, witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an agonizingly distrustful marriage. This, one of my [[ùöùop]] [[favoriùöùe]] Bergman efforts, is a [[stu‘Åy]] of a couple [[jarre‘Å]] from their safely [[selùöè-unaware]] lives and violated by a manipulative despair, testing them both to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to some extent, too self-serving and restless to have any patience for his capricious breakdowns into crying. His suppressed emotional issues have led to the repression of the very [[initiati—µe]] and excitement that attracted them to begin with. The [[immen—ïe]] last twenty [[minute—ï]], sporadically [[interrupte‘Å]] by [[image—ï]] of the [[ov]] [[erwhelming]] gray sky, are [[amng]] the closest to [[rea‚Öº]] [[emoùöùion]] that [[Berman]] [[eve‚≤Ö]] filmed.<[[b‚≤Ö]] /><[[b‚≤Ö]] />All [[sy]] [[stems]] of [[dogm…ë]] and [[f]] [[aith]] are the antagonists in this very essential and downbeat portrait.

"Yeah, a long time ago it [[turned]] into a [[tourist]] [[attraction]]. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven [[Seagal's]] character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy [[9-year-old]] every time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, getting back to the plot. [[It's]] funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization. [[He's]] [[sentenced]] to five years, and that old line between determination and [[stupidity]] instantly vanishes. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a [[meaningless]] string of action sequences, most of which aren't [[even]] [[well]] [[choreographed]].<br /><br />Oh, how about this, a [[helicopter]] [[crashes]] through the [[roof]] of ""[[New]] Alcatraz"" at one [[point]], accidentally [[freeing]] all of the inmates. [[And]] what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<[[br]] /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I [[sometimes]] disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.","Yeah, a long time ago it [[turne‘Å]] into a [[tourisùöù]] [[attracùöùion]].

Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market .

"Andrew Gurland's ""Cheats"" is his [[fictionalized]] ""true story"" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. The quartet are: supercilious school-hating Trevor Fehrman (as Handsome Davis), his likewise good-looking pal Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their chubby school-hating chum Elden Henson (as Sammy), and crooked geekster Martin Starr (as Applebee). The adults include high-strung North Point principal Mary Tyler Moore (as Mrs. Stark) and pornography-loving father Griffin Dunne (as Mr. Davis). The high jinks begin with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher's grade book. Put this one at the bottom of the pile; and, be thankful it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record.<br /><br />*** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson","Andrew Gurland's ""Cheats"" is his [[fiœ≤tionalized]] ""true story"" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests.

"(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct.<br /><[[br]] />(Comment) The [[movie]] was a little slow and the [[concept]] of going back in time and changing things was a little [[overdone]]. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future were [[silly]] looking. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.

"[[This]] is a [[movie]] that will leave you [[thinking]], is he or isn't he? While [[many]] [[people]] have [[complained]] about the ambiguous [[ending]], it [[gives]] [[room]] for the audience to [[think]] and interpret it from the [[signs]]. [[This]] is my interpretation and [[theory]], and I [[believe]] it is very [[sound]]. <[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[First]], here is the plot. One [[day]], [[Prot]] (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell's (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot [[freely]] talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is [[classified]] as a looney and is locked up in a low security [[level]] ward. He befriends the other patients and [[quickly]] [[convinces]] them of his [[story]]. In fact, he tells them he can [[take]] one person [[back]] with him. [[Soon]] [[Dr]]. [[Powell]] is beginning to [[question]] [[Prot's]] insanity and as the plot progresses, it is [[harder]] and harder to prove Prot wrong. <br /><br />In the end, Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. <br /><br />On to my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of [[Prot's]]. On one of [[Prot's]] previous [[visits]] to Earth, Robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. [[Prot]] and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family, and [[Robert]] [[slaying]] the murderer, Robert decides to [[commit]] suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the [[time]], but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to stop Robert. So [[Prot]] takes over the thinking of Robert, taking over his body so to [[speak]]. Awhile [[later]], Prot ([[still]] [[inhabiting]] Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. [[When]] he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />[[PROT'S]] KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR [[POWELL]] FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.","[[Thi—ï]] is a [[mo—µie]] that will leave you [[thinùíåing]], is he or isn't he?

"""Showtime"" falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard about Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro teaming up for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! As ""real life"" crime or cops go-- and plot, for that matter-- it is pretty illogical, but DUH--- this is a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chases, aerial shots, and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a bit tiresome and overdone. 9/11 sensibilities aside, for myself, all that pyro-techno hyper-effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years. It seemed a lame substitute for characterization, story, and engaging emotions. I hope the lesser quantity of it in ""Showtime"" is an indicator of a trend in Hollywood. A trend downwards, of less use of the silly, less use of the exploding building.<br /><br />Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their screen presence and charisma-- and even their character depth-- have been ""a joy to behold"" for many years. That can't be dismissed here--- they are engaging actors, and entertaining and appealing in this movie. I can't put my finger on it, but perhaps the explosions, the excessive FX, and all of that diminished the final product??? Perhaps, or perhaps it was something else, or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential.

"Well, I'm a few days late but what the [[hell]]....! [[Anyways]], the word that [[best]] describes my reaction to ""See No Evil"" was....SURPRISE. [[The]] film is [[actually]] pretty [[good]].

"<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when I went to watch it, it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. I think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end, ""what a piece of crap"". In order to understand Cronica de un desayuno, one has to be mexican, and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). There's nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in Mexico at least, share. One has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. The older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother is going to an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... The stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempt of suicide, subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... The music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.<br /><br />One of the [[best]] mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.<br /><br />","<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them.

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: [[They]] [[also]] [[left]] out a big part of the [[story]] (other than a 2 [[second]] glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps [[set]] up the relationship between Fred and [[Thorpe]]. In the movie Fred's [[betrayal]] in the [[end]] is not nearly as affecting, because they don't [[seem]] all that close. In the book they become pretty good [[friends]] especially on Fred's [[side]], which [[makes]] it all the more [[ironic]] that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's [[downfall]]. [[Fred]] also [[suffered]] a bit from casting, I [[love]] [[Adam]] Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be [[alive]] [[upbeat]] [[sort]] of [[Detective]], [[character]] traits which book Fred [[possesses]] which [[makes]] it more [[obviously]] out of [[character]] for him to mess with [[evidence]] and thus more shocking. [[Patricia]] and [[Edgarson]] were pretty close to the book, and James [[Cromwell]] was great despite not [[looking]] much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring [[boat]] house scene which was entirely [[added]] for the film was much less [[interesting]] than the police [[finding]] Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this [[movie]] had been funnier or [[smarter]] [[instead]] of duller.","When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited.

"With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted ([[Betty's]] $24 million as opposed to [[Company's]] measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and [[stand-up]] comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its moderate box office and critical success, perhaps [[moviegoers]] weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. The story follows (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg [[Kinnear]]) but is [[trapped]] in a loveless marriage to a slimy car [[dealer]] ([[Aaron]] [[Eckhart]], who [[made]] his big-screen debut in Company). When her [[husband]] is gruesomely murdered by [[two]] hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's sent into [[shock]] and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her [[object]] of [[affection]] -- [[unaware]] that he's only an actor. When [[Freeman]] and Rock [[discover]] that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they [[hit]] the [[road]] as [[well]] and [[outrageousness]] [[ensues]]. Fans of LaBute's previous [[work]] might have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker --, but when you think about it, the connection is [[rather]] clear: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is [[really]] some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. [[But]] personally, I think he's coming to the defense of the fair [[sex]] and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. One of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.<br /><br />Grade: A-","With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted ([[Betty`s]] $24 million as opposed to [[Company'—ï]] measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his roots.

"This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovsk√Ω is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its [[details]]. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life [[who's]] trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerov√°), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Lukn√°r) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no good [[explanation]] precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the [[big]] garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a [[posh]] Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in [[cases]] like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though [[Prague-born]], owns a [[lovely]] villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story?

This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.","This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovsk√Ω is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its [[d]] [[etails]]. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life [[whos]] trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerov√°), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Lukn√°r) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no good [[explanaùöùion]] precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the [[bg]] garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a [[—Äosh]] Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in [[case—ï]] like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though [[Prague-brn]], owns a [[lov–µly]] villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing.

"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those [[bimbo]] guys who wear [[Levi's]] Jeans and stand in front of a herd of [[stampeding]] Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like [[Levi's]] too.

In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the [[stick]]. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this [[wimpy]] [[book-worm]] character [[out-runs]] a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls ([[like]] Spiderman).

Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! [[Jeremy]] Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. The [[scenes]] which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even [[though]] the period dress and [[vehicles]] are shown, the characters [[act]] like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and [[talk]].

The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then [[fails]] to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the [[Morlocks]] being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have some [[large]] dark [[butcher]] shop [[filled]] with [[knives]] and cutlery, yet they are never seen [[using]] any weapons except for a [[blow-dart]]. Also silly is the [[giant]] pit [[full]] of [[water]] and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all [[walking]] around chewing on [[meaty]] bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter.

When Drebin has a line like ""You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan."", how can THAT be comedy!?!?

However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the [[travesty]] known as THE HAUNT.<br /><br />With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is just downright [[boring]].<br /><br />Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. The final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.<br /><br />The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.<br /><br />On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.<br /><br />Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some!<br /><br />First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly [[terrible]] right across the board. This [[factor]] does the most damage to the production, undermining any [[possible]] [[credibility]] of [[belief]] or [[interest]] on the [[part]] of the [[viewer]]. [[The]] voice of the vengeful [[spirit]] [[sounds]] more [[like]] a teenage girl [[experiencing]] [[teenage]] angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent [[intent]]. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice [[began]] to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.<br /><br />Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!<br /><br />The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.<br /><br />Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting.

"Back when I was working person, I remember having a really obnoxious [[client]] to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis.

I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and [[Clint]] Eastwood in their battle of [[wits]].<[[br]] /><br />In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his [[doubts]] ever since and been given to drink and his [[life]] at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.<br /><br />But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a [[professional]] at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a [[deserved]] Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought Malkovich was better.<br /><br />Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. <br /><br />The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.<br /><br />Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm, John Mahoney as the Secret Service head, Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.<br /><br />But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire.

I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and [[Clinùöù]] Eastwood in their battle of [[wit—ï]].<[[–¨r]] /><br />In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his [[duobts]] ever since and been given to drink and his [[liùöèe]] at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.<br /><br />But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a [[professiona‚Öº]] at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a [[deserve‘Å]] Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought Malkovich was better.<br /><br />Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. <br /><br />The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.<br /><br />Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm, John Mahoney as the Secret Service head, Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.<br /><br />But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire.

"Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is [[less]] funny and climaxes with a [[disappointing]] only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin's 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'. 'Censored' is fairly weak by comparison.","Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out.

I [[liked]] it [[even]] though I agree ""London"" is better and I prefer that version, too. <br /><br />The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a ""balloon"" in a restaurant. It also introduces the lead female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America.

I also [[liked]] the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - [[amazing]]!<br /><br />However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either.

The one in the 1990s took such liberties that it [[bare‚Öºy]] [[seeme‘Å]] to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and prurient.<br /><br />Here we have Billie Piper who looks like a pretty country wench. She has a charming personality that develops nicely - but she has flagrantly [[die‘Å]] blonde hair, with black eyebrows and - through much of the pic - dark brown roots. So much for [[unspolied]] cousin. It is incredibly distracting, and the rest of the cast is in the greasy hair, rumpled clothing genre that shows a real [[diserspect]] for period accuracy.<br /><br />One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all the versions. She is note perfect, flirtatious without being at all modern or suggestive, flippant and completely without any moral or ethical compass.

"Not being a particular fan of westerns, I watched this primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Lucy Show"" type of role.

Why, that's the question I ask here. It's not even [[good]] porn [[either]], [[besides]] being [[far]] too soft it's dull, boring & the [[not-worth-mentioning]] sex [[scenes]] are few & [[far]] between.

That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't.

"I'd been postponing [[purchasing]] this one [[ever]] [[since]] its [[DVD]] [[release]] ¬ñ for one [[thing]], because I'd been [[somewhat]] underwhelmed by this director's [[two]] other [[horror]] titles (SQUIRM [[[1976]]] and BLUE SUNSHINE [[[1977]]]), but also the [[fact]] that the film itself is [[said]] to have been [[slightly]] trimmed for gore on the Media Blasters/Shriek Show 2-Disc Set!

This factor, however, only helped remind me that I've yet to check out another such example ¬ñ Wes Craven's classic THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977), whose 2-Disc R1 edition from Anchor Bay I purchased some time ago but, after all, Halloween-time is fast approaching... <br /><br />Anyway, the film manages an [[effortlessly]] [[unsettling]] backwoods [[atmosphere]] (it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of Oregon) ¬ñ with [[plenty]] of [[effective]] frissons [[throughout]] but, [[thankfully]], not too much [[violence]] ([[even]] if the [[last]] of the [[villains]] is dispatched in [[quite]] an [[outrageous]] [[fashion]]!).

"[[PEP]] SQUAD is at a very low [[point]] with its confusing [[plot]] [[line]] and [[horrible]] acting.<br /><[[br]] />[[First]], [[let's]] [[tackle]] the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling [[anger]] [[throughout]] the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become [[prom]] queen. However, it becomes [[completely]] [[unknown]] to the [[audience]] why Cherry wants to become prom [[queen]] in the first place. Before the [[nominations]] are [[even]] read off, she storms [[around]] the school with a constant [[disinterest]] upon being there, and [[shows]] no interest in the [[place]] or its students to begin with. Why does she [[care]] so [[much]] to be their [[prom]] queen? [[Brooke]] Balderson [[apparently]] [[presents]] an ""[[acclaimed]]"" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry [[face]], stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you [[handed]] any young [[actor]]/actress a script that only [[requires]] him/her to [[act]] insanely [[angry]], you're not [[asking]] for much. You're [[also]] not [[allowing]] the character to develop very well.<br /><br />Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is [[even]] worse. [[Dreiling]] [[shows]] [[absolutely]] no [[emotion]] and no [[connection]] to her [[character]] [[whatsoever]]. When being harassed by her principal, she [[knocks]] him down (after several [[seconds]]) with no [[feelings]] of [[disgust]] or [[shock]] or [[anything]] [[equally]] traumatizing. [[Her]] lines are read [[like]] she is [[reading]] [[trivia]] off the [[back]] of a cereal box.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Throughout]] the rest of the film, the students in [[charge]] of his [[kidnapping]] [[sound]] more [[like]] they are [[planning]] a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their [[principal]], [[sitting]] [[tied]] up in their [[basement]].<br /><[[br]] />Meanwhile, Cherry is off [[killing]] [[several]] female prom queen candidates, and no one even [[notices]] or [[cares]]. (Yeah, I [[get]] it, I [[get]] it, the whole town is [[worried]] about [[prom]]. Very realistic. At [[least]] you could throw in some [[funny]] [[scenes]] with the [[cops]], but that might be asking too [[much]].) [[For]] [[example]], [[right]] after Cherry drives by the [[school]] and [[shoots]] down a [[handful]] of students, Beth is found being interviewed by the [[local]] media. [[The]] reporter mentions ""the shooter"" in a way that [[makes]] it seem [[like]] no one [[knows]] who [[killed]] these [[innocent]] students, but then one [[second]] later asks, ""What do you think about [[guns]] in the [[hands]] of minors?"" or something to that [[effect]]. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /><br />At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that ""she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard"" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, [[unaltered]] mood. No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.<br /><br />Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their ""I'm so indie and mod"" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic.<br /><br />The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful.

"Spoiler [[Alert]] - [[although]] this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to [[completely]] explain.<br /><[[br]] />'[[Mulholland]] Drive' is by [[far]] the most [[successful]] [[expression]] of David [[Lynch's]] cinematographic style and [[vision]] [[since]] the first season of his '[[Twin]] Peaks' TV [[series]]. [[As]] Lynch enthusiasts [[know]], his is a style and [[vision]] [[uniquely]] [[blended]] from [[film]] [[noir]], horror movies, surrealism, and [[parapsychology]] ¬ñ with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and [[black]] [[humor]] thrown in for [[good]] measure. [[All]] these elements are [[richly]] at [[work]] in '[[Mulholland]] [[Drive]],' [[making]] for a [[riveting]], hair-raising, and highly [[satisfying]] [[film]] experience ¬ñ especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the [[plot]] pieces fit into a logical, [[mystery-unraveling]] [[whole]].<br /><br />[[The]] film features [[wonderful]] [[performances]] by [[Naomi]] Watts and Laura Harring in the [[lead]] roles of young [[women]] whose lives intersect in various [[ways]] amid a [[Hollywood]] setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, [[retro]] '50s nostalgia, and [[satirical]] [[self-aggrandizement]]. Their seemingly random initial [[meeting]] occurs after the [[film's]] opening scene, in which [[Harring's]] character escapes an attempt on her [[life]] thanks to a fortuitous, not to [[mention]] horrific, [[automobile]] [[accident]]. Staggering down the hillside from [[Mulholland]] Drive to [[Sunset]] Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood [[thoroughfares]]), she finds her way to the very apartment that [[Betty]] ([[Naomi]] Watts) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt [[Ruth]],' a [[purportedly]] successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a [[new]] movie. [[As]] we later [[learn]], Betty had herself [[arrived]] from Deep River, Ontario, [[shortly]] after [[winning]] a [[jitterbug]] [[contest]].<br /><br />A [[highly]] [[energetic]] and [[stylized]] [[flashback]] to the [[contest]] [[forms]] one of [[two]] [[pre-credit]] [[prologue]] sequences that [[frame]] [[Betty's]] descent from the clich√©d would-be-starlet's [[bright-eyed]] innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character adopts the [[name]] 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir [[classic]] 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination ¬ñ rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater ¬ñ and more mysterious ¬ñ than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful.

[[Al‚Öº]] these elements are [[rich‚Öºy]] at [[worùíå]] in '[[Mlholland]] [[Dri—µe]],' [[maùíåing]] for a [[rivet]] [[ing]], hair-raising, and highly [[satisùöèying]] [[filÔΩç]] experience ¬ñ especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the [[pot]] pieces fit into a logical, [[myste‚≤Öy-unraveling]] [[who‚Öºe]].<br /><br />[[Te]] film features [[wonderfu‚Öº]] [[performance—ï]] by [[NaoÔΩçi]] Watts and Laura Harring in the [[lad]] roles of young [[woÔΩçen]] whose lives intersect in various [[way—ï]] amid a [[Hollywoo‘Å]] setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, [[ret‚≤Öo]] '50s nostalgia, and [[satirica‚Öº]] [[selùöè-aggrandizement]]. Their seemingly random initial [[meeùöùing]] occurs after the [[film'—ï]] opening scene, in which [[Harring'—ï]] character escapes an attempt on her [[liùöèe]] thanks to a fortuitous, not to [[menùöùion]] horrific, [[automobi‚Öºe]] [[accidenùöù]]. Staggering down the hillside from [[Mulolland]] Drive to [[Sunseùöù]] Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood [[thoroughfars]]), she finds her way to the very apartment that [[Betùöùy]] ([[NaoÔΩçi]] Watts) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt [[Ruùöùh]],' a [[purportedy]] successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a [[nw]] movie. [[A—ï]] we later [[lea‚≤Ön]], Betty had herself [[arrive‘Å]] from Deep River, Ontario, [[short‚Öºy]] after [[‘ùinning]] a [[jitt–µrbug]] [[contesùöù]].<br /><br />A [[high‚Öºy]] [[energetiœ≤]] and [[styized]] [[flashb…ëck]] to the [[contesùöù]] [[form—ï]] one of [[to]] [[pe-credit]] [[pro‚Öºogue]] sequences that [[fraÔΩçe]] [[Betty`s]] descent from the clich√©d would-be-starlet's [[bright-eye‘Å]] innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character adopts the [[naÔΩçe]] 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir [[classiœ≤]] 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination ¬ñ rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater ¬ñ and more mysterious ¬ñ than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.",1

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being [[digested]] originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to [[emphasize]] how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are [[lousy]] dancers.

"The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time [[masterpiece]]. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not [[quite]] as [[good]] in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. ""Scorpion"") and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not [[long]] before she's back to doing what she does [[best]].<[[br]] /><br />The film [[gets]] off to a [[great]] [[start]] as we [[see]] Scorpion hack the arm off a [[copper]] intent on taking her [[back]] to [[jail]].

[[That's]] not to say that there isn't still plenty of [[action]] - [[Scorpion]] still spends a [[lot]] of time in 'revenge [[mode']] and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko [[Kaji]] once again reprises her role as the sinister title [[character]] and it's [[another]] [[understated]], [[almost]] wordless [[performance]].

There's a few [[surreal]] sequences, not as [[many]] as in the first [[film]] and nowhere near as in the second, but the film [[stays]] in with the rest of the series on that point.

"If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to [[demonstrate]] that our troops have the bravery, the [[resourcefulness]] and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony [[Asquith]] provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the [[officers]] can be jarring. Here, as in so many other British war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an [[educated]] [[fluency]] that would place them at home in [[England's]] finest [[ruling-class]] establishments. In this [[movie]], [[Freddie]] [[Taylor]] (John Mills), the captain of the [[submarine]] [[Sea]] Tiger, is [[clever]], confident, [[resourceful]], [[aggressive]], in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, quick to make a decision. [[And]] it helps that [[he's]] [[lucky]]. His men are [[jolly]] tars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we [[spend]] the first third of the movie [[getting]] to know these people while [[they're]] on leave, after that [[things]] get tense quickly. <[[br]] /><br />Taylor and his [[sub]] are [[ordered]] to [[destroy]] the [[Brandenburg]], a [[new]] German battleship. They just [[miss]] the ship when it [[enters]] the Kiel [[Canal]] and heads into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and [[decides]] the Sea [[Tiger]] will go after it, through mine [[fields]], anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home [[base]]. [[After]] [[several]] tense [[situations]], the [[confrontation]] [[takes]] [[place]]. [[The]] Sea [[Tiger]] lets [[loose]] six torpedoes but has to [[dive]], not knowing if it had [[done]] its job. After a [[clever]] [[subterfuge]], Taylor [[outfoxes]] a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough [[fuel]]. He [[plans]] to [[scuttle]] his [[sub]] and surrender when, just at the [[last]] moment, [[James]] [[Hobson]] (Eric Portman), a seaman who had been [[sullen]] and a [[loner]] and who speaks German, says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a [[fuel]] depot. [[He]] [[thinks]] it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. [[Some]], like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious [[shorthand]] clich√©s. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clich√©s that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clich√©s. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character.

"[[The]] Best Years of Our Life is [[often]] [[compared]] to [[It's]] a Wonderful [[Life]]. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value [[individual]] [[life]] may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our [[feelings]] about war have [[changed]] in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is [[totally]] just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.<br /><br />I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. [[It]] is a [[powerful]] [[experience]], moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.<br /><br />I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.<br /><br />Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.<br /><br />No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><br />The [[moving]] part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.<br /><br />The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife ¬ñ standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.<br /><br />Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.<br /><br />All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.<br /><br />I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.","[[Te]] Best Years of Our Life is [[ofùöùen]] [[compare‘Å]] to [[Its]] a Wonderful [[Lie]]. They never should be.

We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is [[total‚Öºy]] just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.<br /><br />I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. [[Iùöù]] is a [[powerf’Ωl]] [[experienœ≤e]], moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.<br /><br />I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.<br /><br />Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.<br /><br />No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><br />The [[mov—ñng]] part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.<br /><br />The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife ¬ñ standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.<br /><br />Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.<br /><br />All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.<br /><br />I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.",1

"Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one [[weird]] film! Supposedly an insight into the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment, entitled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm up, but it's good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments. It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table, while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human [[eyeball]]! I've got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. The following story is the best of the bunch, and takes in the ""old favourite"" sick movie theme of [[incest]]. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He's repulsed by her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and naturally he gets his way. This story stands out because of the monotonous and 'matter of fact' narration, as well as the ending - which doesn't fail to deliver the shocks. This segment is well acted, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty.<br /><br />Naturally, the next two sections aren't as good as the second one; so the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain still [[manages]] to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesn't do it [[right]] [[away]], however, as the third segment is the weakest of the film, and simply sees a [[lot]] of [[people]] have sex with the ground. It's very surreal, and [[therefore]] [[memorable]] for that same [[reason]]; but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it, and I was in the [[mood]] for [[something]] a [[bit]] more [[morbid]] after the second section. The [[film]] ends on a [[high]], [[however]], as while I'm not entirely sure what the point was - the final [[segment]] features the film's [[best]] imagery. [[This]] segment [[focuses]] on religion, and certainly isn't for anyone that values it! [[Director]] Karim [[Hussain]] has achieved something here - as while this [[collection]] of [[four]] 'extreme' stories doesn't come together as a complete [[whole]], the film almost feels tasteful as it's shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner. The director would seem to have been imitating the highly respected [[surreal]] director Luis Bu√±uel, albeit with gore, rape and incest; and if you ask me, he hasn't done a bad job at all.

"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who's under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov).

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the [[original]] with some [[kind]] of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a [[sort]] of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of [[drab]] gruel to work with. [[Everything]] in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], starting with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an [[in-your-face]] introduction to the next pivotal character in the [[subject's]] life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the period. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.","One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the [[origianl]] with some [[kid]] of inspired vision, but no.

"I gave ""Airport '79"" only two stars because it's a truly [[lousy]] [[film]]. Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a [[pretty]] good [[job]] in his role.) This is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />A'79 really does seem like an early version of ""Airplane!"" Every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's truly funny.<br /><br />And I'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing.

"I am not [[surprised]] to find user comments for this film full of gushy [[nonsense]], such as that this film ""[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way."" I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not ""prove"" anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and ""The English Patient"" fails on both criteria.<br /><br />I remember the studio's promotion of ""The English Patient"" very clearly: ""From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'"" it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, ""producers,"" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of ""The English Patient,"" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.<br /><br />While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.<br /><[[br]] />Despite misgivings which began when I [[heard]] that shamelessly [[misleading]] [[promotion]], I [[went]] to see this [[film]] in the [[theater]]. As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel's [[peculiar]] [[magic]] had [[failed]], that the [[actors]] [[knew]] their [[words]] but not their characters, and that their characters were [[flat]], [[dull]], and [[unengaging]]. The [[film]] was a complete [[travesty]] of Ondaatje's novel and a completely [[still-born]] cinematic [[artifact]] of the [[worst]] [[description]].<br /><br />Those who [[gush]] over this [[film]] are very apt to [[speak]] with adjectives [[like]], ""[[sweeping]],"" and ""[[grand]],"" and ""[[hypnotic]]."" [[Well]], it is none of those. In [[fact]], not even [[Ondaatje's]] fine novel could be [[described]] as ""[[sweeping]]"" or ""[[grand]]."" It [[could]] be described as ""magical"" and ""hypnotic"" -- yet these are precisely the [[qualities]] that the film so utterly failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.<br /><br />Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the ""essence"" of it.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between [[two]] flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown [[presentation]].<br /><br />The ""grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like"" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (""Dr. Zhivago"") is positively insulting to yet another great director. Take, for example, the ""Patient's"" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these ""grand, sweeping"" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing.

Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and it will not, thankfully, have the strength ever to dig itself out.","I am not [[surpris–µd]] to find user comments for this film full of gushy [[nonsen—ïe]], such as that this film ""[proves] that when it is predestined, love will find a way."" I begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this citation so typifies the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was poured out over this film, even before it hit the theaters. Even the best of films do not ""prove"" anything, nor are they intended to. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and ""The English Patient"" fails on both criteria.<br /><br />I remember the studio's promotion of ""The English Patient"" very clearly: ""From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'"" it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial word, ""producers,"" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of ""The English Patient,"" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.<br /><br />While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever. Aside from plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, the film bears little resemblance to the novel.<br /><[[b‚≤Ö]] />Despite misgivings which began when I [[hear‘Å]] that shamelessly [[mislea‘Åing]] [[promoùöùion]], I [[wenùöù]] to see this [[filÔΩç]] in the [[theate‚≤Ö]]. As it began to unfold, I realized that the rendering of the novel's [[peculia‚≤Ö]] [[magiœ≤]] had [[faile‘Å]], that the [[actor—ï]] [[kne‘ù]] their [[word—ï]] but not their characters, and that their characters were [[flaùöù]], [[dul‚Öº]], and [[uneng]] [[aging]]. The [[filÔΩç]] was a complete [[travsety]] of Ondaatje's novel and a completely [[stil‚Öº-born]] cinematic [[artifacùöù]] of the [[worsùöù]] [[descripùöùion]].<br /><br />Those who [[gsuh]] over this [[f]] [[ilm]] are very apt to [[speaùíå]] with adjectives [[lie]], ""[[sweep—ñng]],"" and ""[[gra’∏d]],"" and ""[[hy—Änotic]]."" [[We]] [[ll]], it is none of those. In [[facùöù]], not even [[Odnaatje's]] fine novel could be [[describe‘Å]] as ""[[s‘ùeeping]]"" or ""[[gran‘Å]]."" It [[coul‘Å]] be described as ""magical"" and ""hypnotic"" -- yet these are precisely the [[qualiies]] that the film so utterly failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.<br /><br />Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the ""essence"" of it.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between [[t]] [[wo]] flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown [[presenation]].<br /><br />The ""grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like"" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (""Dr. Zhivago"") is positively insulting to yet another great director. Take, for example, the ""Patient's"" sandstorm scene, which is no doubt one wherein these ""grand, sweeping"" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grand -- it is not even convincing. The subsequent burying of the characters in the automobile and their emergence after the storm, which no doubt was supposed to affect the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked either drama or emotion --in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had an air of comedy about it where comedy was clearly out of place.<br /><br />This film failed.

"[[Set]] in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film [[portrays]] the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders [[Danton]] (Gerard Depardieu, at his [[finest]]) and Robespierre (a [[commanding]] [[performance]] by the [[Polish]] [[actor]] Wojciech Pszoniak). [[The]] [[moderate]] [[revolutionary]] [[Danton]] has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been [[since]] being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre.

[[This]] was the [[first]] French language film made by Andrzej [[Wajda]] after he had arrived in France from [[Poland]]. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the [[Polish]] government in the late seventies and early [[eighties]]. [[His]] previous [[film]] ""[[Man]] Of Iron"" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and [[Robespierre]]. [[Danton]]/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play ""The Danton Affair"" written by [[Stanislawa]] Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical.

"Go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by Robert Wise, with second-unit direction by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, was designed by Ken Adam and scored by Max Steiner, starred Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, was filmed in colour, scope and stereo, at [[Cinecitta]] in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they'll tell you to go away and stop being silly.<br /><br />They'll tell you that no such film EXISTS. That the names you've quoted NEVER worked together - they weren't even [[contemporaneous]]. And that you've just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to befuddle them.<br /><br />At which point you can direct them to [[IMDb]] and show them the cast and crew of ""Helen Of Troy"". They'll be amazed! This lesser-known sword-and-sandal epic has ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews.<br /><br />And it is certainly an [[oddity]]. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema.

"In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films.

That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously. THe movie The Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's movies. THe two leads were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie. The woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played anal retentive professor was no Clifton Webb but he did a god job. And the Bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors. I laughed at the 50 cent special effects. But that was part of the charm of the movie. It played like a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the 50's.

"Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story line is OK, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average.

"It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be ¬ëright', but some can be wrong, and this one is. There are at least two things about Hamlet which cannot be dispensed with: 1. His indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action. For God's sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead by the end of Act One. Any production has to try to explain why Hamlet delays, why he is incapable of action. 2. His sexual disgust. His total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet throws up. So, what does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty action-man. You could not get further from the character of Hamlet if you tried. There are lots of ways Hamlet can be played, but this isn't one of them! What I don't understand is since they managed to get such good actors for the other parts - Claudius, Polonius and so on, why couldn't they find one to play Hamlet as well.

"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more [[confusing]], WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a [[senseless]] [[mess]]. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber.

Spoilers: The dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. Then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and SURPRISE! something eats him. The other two [[dimwits]] are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about [[35]] years old, minimum). [[Bairstow]] is supposed to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of the kind of [[weirdoes]] that usually [[populate]] movies like ""PITCH BLACK"" ""THE THING"" etc. The truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up [[Bairstow]], since they were travelling the same road??). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. The main lunatic in the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. So the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert. The [[dumbest]] guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his [[arm]] too. [[Sounds]] [[exciting]] so far, [[except]] that a few minutes [[later]], Dr. [[Bairstow]] realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). Now, last time I [[checked]], ants could move around on their own, without having to [[kill]] people in order to use the bones for [[structure]]. If all they need was something hard, they [[could]] have [[put]] a bunch of [[sticks]] together and used those to [[create]] a form. The [[whole]] story is [[really]], really [[dumb]], and the ant explanation is the only one given. The [[rest]] of the [[movie]] is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet.

That's not [[escapism]] -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- that's sad reality. <br /><br />Normally, [[divorce]] or custody is simply part of a greater story and affects the [[way]] we understand it or relate to its characters.

[[That's]] a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn something so real into something that can capture our attention and then make us not feel spiteful as the mirror is held up to our face. Writer/[[director]] Robert [[Benton]] [[definitely]] achieves both and in [[impressive]] fashion in [[adapting]] this [[novel]] by [[Avery]] Corman.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />The [[story]], as one would expect, is [[quite]] simple: Big business advertising man [[Ted]] [[Kramer]] ([[Dustin]] [[Hoffman]]) comes [[home]] to [[find]] his [[wife]] Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their [[7-year-old]] son Billy (Justin Henry). [[Ted]] then [[must]] quickly learn to be an [[active]] father in the [[boys']] [[life]] and as soon as he does, Joanna [[brings]] a custody suit upon him.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />To make an [[Oscar-winning]] [[drama]] about something so generic and [[particularly]] dialogue- heavy [[first]] [[takes]] [[tremendous]] acting talent.

Streep does so [[effortlessly]]. [[The]] [[young]] [[boy]], [[Justin]] Henry, who at his age was the youngest competitive [[category]] nominee in Academy [[Awards]] [[history]], plays the embodiment of all [[7-year-old]] [[children]] [[exceptionally]] well.<br /><br />Benton's writing and direction takes these performances to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits (""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Superman"") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's [[Billy]] french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.<br /><br />You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen.

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routine]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses [[Adam's]] warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, [[82-minute]] oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the [[desert]] rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of [[hero]], and leave him as the only survivor. [[Before]] this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. [[Sawyer]] ([[Peter]] Graves of ""[[Stalag]] [[17]]"") brings in his [[partner]] with an [[arrow]] in his chest. [[While]] [[Adam]] is getting hot [[water]] to help in [[removing]] the arrow, the [[greedy]] Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the [[gold]] is [[also]] left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the [[ill-fated]] cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />[[The]] biggest surprise in this [[unremarkable]] western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles.

Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".",0
"The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the second world war, a unique setting, with a couple of British agents being held by the Germans in a farm house. Since they aren't technically at war yet, it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) escape into the countryside and split up. Milland happens upon gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner. Their encounter is an [[amazing]] and captivating [[scene]], not so much for Milland but for Dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness to a whole new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to his mission, to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed Nazi. The Hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they [[would]] be one of the targets for extermination by the [[Nazis]] [[adds]] a certain [[tension]]. [[The]] film [[straddles]] the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search to [[get]] the formula, and a colorful [[though]] not too convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, [[they're]] both very [[good]]; it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. Nonetheless, there are some [[tense]] and [[interesting]] [[points]] here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich does a great palm reading and Milland nearly as good faking one, and a dinner party of Germans of various stripes at which the announcement comes over the [[radio]] that Germany had been [[attacked]] by Poland and everyone [[stands]] and does a stiff [[arm]] [[salute]]. Mitchell [[Leison]] [[may]] have [[missed]] some opportunities here and there, but he fully [[took]] [[advantage]] of others.","The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the second world war, a unique setting, with a couple of British agents being held by the Germans in a farm house.

"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy [[crime-fighter]] known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two [[henchmen]] share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />Back in late June of 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were ""Ren & [[Stimpy]]: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John [[Kricfalusi]], ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring [[Kelsee]] Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a [[little]] let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an [[awesome]] intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[funny]] as hell! The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see [[Stripperella]] go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, [[something]] seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy. Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD. You will laugh yourself silly.<br /><br />Rated TV-MA: Crude and Sexual Humor and Nudity, Runtime: About 25 minutes per episode, Score: 9/10","""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy [[crime-fighte‚≤Ö]] known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two [[henhmen]] share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />Back in late June of 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were ""Ren & [[StiÔΩçpy]]: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John [[Kricf…ëlusi]], ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring [[Kel—ïee]] Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a [[l—ñttle]] let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an [[awesoÔΩçe]] intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[ùöèunny]] as hell! The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see [[Stripperell…ë]] go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, [[someùöùhing]] seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish.

"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very [[disappointed]]. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork.

However, it does not have much of a plot.<br /><br />Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.<br /><br />This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's.

Bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in Spain and France between the world wars.<br /><br />Dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- The Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting clocks), and even Hitchcock (Psycho).

"After slightly over 50 years of avid film watching, I've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.<br /><br />1.	Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour 2.	Keep your characters to a minimum. If adapting a novel, combine characteristics and actions of minor characters<br /><br /> into one person 3.	Make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation 4.	Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either 5.	Get the best music [[money]] can buy. Frequently it matters more than acting, photography, etc. 6.	Usually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes, it's not going to get any better<br /><br />`Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the [[worst]] I've ever [[heard]] in a modestly budgeted movie. This is altogether surprising considering Bernstein's credentials (`Man With the Golden Arm,' `The Magnificent Seven,' `The Great Escape,' [[`Sons]] of Katie [[Elder']]).

Add a couple from the previous [[year]], [[Orson]] [[Welles']] Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo, and Nick [[Ray's]] [[Wind]] Across the [[Everglades]], and you've got a pretty good summing up of what was [[possible]] within the [[classic]] Hollywood style.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[At]] the same time, two films appeared that hinted at a [[whole]] new way of making films. One was [[Jean-Luc]] [[Godard's]] Breathless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. [[The]] [[two]] films had [[certain]] things in common, largely improvised acting by non stars, handheld [[cameras]], low budgets, and a certain youthful, [[jazzy]] [[swagger]]. In [[certain]] ways, though, they couldn't be farther apart. [[Godard]] was [[still]] a believer in the director as arbiter of style. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of the [[classic]] crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor, and a [[refugee]] from [[New]] York's underground [[theater]] scene. [[His]] first film shows him little impressed with the cinema, and a big believer in actors. Godard's film constantly references it's own artifice, [[whereas]] Shadows aims for a certain kind of naturalism.<br /><br />It doesn't [[reach]] it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. [[But]] it [[feels]] powerful, kinetic but lilting [[like]] the cool jazz on the score, certainly the [[main]] inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here. It ultimately doesn't hold together, mainly because Cassavetes' actors here are amateurish beatniks, where [[Cassavetes]] style [[requires]] [[strong]], [[imaginative]] [[actors]]. His later work with [[Gena]] [[Rowlands]], Ben Gazarra, and Peter [[Falk]] blows this out of the [[water]]. [[Due]] to the [[director's]] technical inexperience, some bits of dialogue had to be [[redubbed]] later, which defeats the freshness of the [[improvisation]].

"I was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. I was born on may 14th 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80's style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the [[greatest]] too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks [[help]] him pack. While they are talking, [[Alvin]] [[expresses]] his will to [[come]] with Dave and to [[see]] the world (Even though, technically Dave is only going to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as ''The World''). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the [[care]] of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. [[Soon]] Dave is off to the [[airport]] and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. [[Later]], at a local Caf√© the Chipmunks are playing a game of ''Around the World in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, Alvin get's in an argument with Brittany about who would [[really]] [[win]] a [[race]] around the world. [[Two]] diamond smugglers [[sitting]] at a [[nearby]] [[table]], [[Klaus]] and [[Claudia]] Furschtien overhear their [[argument]] and, [[needing]] a [[safe]] way of [[transporting]] their diamonds over the world, [[decide]] to fool the children into delivering them for them. [[They]] set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. The winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the top, Don't you know! we never stop believing now''","I was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's.

"Progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love. Completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives. The hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist. He comes to believe that aliens are responsible for this lapse in time and that the unborn baby he once thought was his and his wife's actually belongs to the aliens.<br /><br />If ya ask me, this is a [[great]] scifi/horror story. Taking a highly questionable real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs up from this guy. I love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas. So if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial, you should be pretty happy with Progeny. At least story-wise anyways.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie overall is pretty average. With average acting by all actors. Yep, even by the consistently awesome Mr. Dourif, who still does deliver the best performance. Though the black head doctor, delivers his lines really well. There are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy, which is fine in my book. I like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese, and I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />Anyways, with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors. I especially didn't care for the Mother Hysteria the film went for. She wanted a baby so badly that she'd neglect and dismiss everything her loving husband (who's a doctor!!) said to her. It almost reached a point where you actually didn't care what happened to her.<br /><br />The Progeny is another flick by Brian Yuzna from the icky-sticky film, Society. Again he delivers some slimy effects, and again he delivers a pretty unique tale of horror. If you're into scifi/horror or are a fan of Dourif and or Yuzna films, there's no real reason not to check out this flick if you get the chance. A generous 7 outta 10.","Progeny is about a husband and wife who experience time loss while making love. Completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they try to go on with their lives.

"i just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy. But after a certain point, I began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action/adventure. The absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the Delon and Kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles????? Dumb yet funny---the kicker comes here though---after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well...if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie. The dumb parts of this movie include the total [[lack]] of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in Paris and go ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the PASSENGERS DON""T EVEN SEE IT???? ITS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES!!!!-----final rating for this move--- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy","i just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy.

"The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar.<br /><br />It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here.<br /><br />It is also genuinely frightening, with [[excellent]] performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way.<br /><br />If I do have a small [[criticism]], there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring.

"I had always eyed Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of Lamberto Bava's [[terrible]] DEMONS (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but I decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full Halloween swing.

"I first was made aware of this film when I saw a preview before another movie. I was intrigued but it didn't get to see it before it's short run in theaters was done.<br /><br />It is not an easy movie to watch multiple times. There is much violence inflicted upon unarmed civilians. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines sums up on.

"[[Enjoyed]] this film which [[deals]] entirely about an average family, so it appears. Ben Travis, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophy's, however, he hates it very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son, Tim, (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter, Penny, (Michelle Williams) who is fortunate to be away in college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also. A very tragic event happens in the family which changes everyone's personality, young and old start using drugs, smoking pot and drinking all the time at parties. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells her son Tim.","[[Enjyed]] this film which [[dea‚Öºs]] entirely about an average family, so it appears.

"A good, but not great film, ""The Great Dictator"" is [[Chaplin's]] first [[talkie]]. It's a [[good]] [[effort]], and at times a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of Chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue.

"So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. However, if you haven't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. Secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation.

"[[Thursday]] is clearly derivative of the 'new [[wave']] of crime [[films]] [[released]] [[since]] [[Quentin]] [[Tarantino]] took the genre by storm with Reservoir [[Dogs]] and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to [[ensure]] that it [[remains]] an [[interesting]] little [[film]]. Thursday [[utilises]] a few characters mostly [[within]] a single location. It [[works]] because each character is [[quirky]] enough in their own [[right]] to be [[memorable]], and when [[put]] [[together]] what you've got is a very [[amusing]] little thriller. There is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody [[goes]] into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. The pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when Casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, Nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. Thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...<br /><br />The first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for [[refreshments]]. The scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very [[funny]] film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is [[difficult]] to dislike. It's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke back him up nicely.

"[[Mickey]] [[Rourke]] is [[enjoying]] a renaissance at the [[moment]]... and [[fair]] play to him. I always liked his [[image]] and his [[acting]] ability in such [[fare]] as [[Angel]] [[Heart]] and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. [[But]] this [[film]] gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.<br /><br />First and [[foremost]] - this whole [[thing]] just doesn't [[make]] [[sense]]. [[Rourke]] is a [[hardened]] IRA [[killer]] who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never [[kill]] again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.<br /><br />However, when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for ¬£50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.<br /><br />A wealth of things arise here which just don't [[add]] up : <br /><br />1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.<br /><br />2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the [[hassle]] of dealing with Rourke? <br /><br />3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, I may add - to take confession? [[No]] way.<br /><br />[[4]]. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? <br /><br />5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.<br /><br />6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church ""fixing"" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? <br /><br />7. Why get Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /><br />8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.<br /><br />9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in ""love"" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /><br />10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.<br /><br />11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.<br /><br />12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.<br /><br />13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.<br /><br />I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.<br /><br />Oooppps - I have just mentioned them.<br /><br />Overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.<br /><br />4/10.","[[Micùíåey]] [[Rourùíåe]] is [[enœ≥oying]] a renaissance at the [[momenùöù]]... and [[far]] play to him.

"[[As]] a [[longtime]] admirer of the [[2001]] [[film]] ""Moulin Rouge"" and a more [[recent]] admirer of [[Jean]] [[Renoir's]] film-making, I knew that [[I'd]] [[inevitably]] watch his ""[[French]] Cancan"" [[sooner]] or later. [[The]] movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge [[nightclub]]. The [[impresario]] [[Danglard]] (Jean Gabin) [[tries]] to turn [[Montmartre]] laundress [[Nini]] (Fran√ßoise Arnoul) into a [[cancan]] star, [[without]] arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress, the belly-dancing [[Lola]] (Maria Felix). This is just one of [[several]] love triangles in ""French [[Cancan]]""--true to stereotype, these French [[showbiz]] [[folk]] are always [[falling]] in [[love]].<br /><br />[[Renoir]] directs with his typical [[gentle]] [[humor]] and attention to supporting [[characters]], and also wrote the [[lyrics]] to a beautiful waltz [[song]] prominently featured in the movie. Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero.

We learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of Spain for some [[miniature-set]] mayhem.<br /><br />Now when I say the monster is unrealistic, I am not [[exaggerating]].

Bottoms and Power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a [[serpent-induced]] shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). None of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. <br /><[[br]] />As [[illogical]] as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous [[disappearances]], a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended [[non-adventure]] to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. The end.<br /><br />I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on.

"If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Life was slow then, compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most [[wonderful]] [[music]], composed by Gustav Mahler.<br /><br />This movie is slow, there is no [[denying]] it. No special [[effects]], car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. [[No]] perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.<br /><br />So, basically, nothing much happens in this movie? [[Not]] if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum.

"When I [[decided]] to [[try]] [[watching]] a [[movie]] about [[cryogenic]] zombies (""[[cryonoids]]""), I wasn't expecting a whole lot. [[That's]] [[exactly]] what I [[got]], and then [[even]] less. [[Aside]] from a shortage of special effects (squibs?) and a [[severe]] lack of any acting talent, ""The [[Chilling]]"" also [[sports]] the [[absolute]] [[worst]] script [[I've]] [[ever]] [[seen]] [[made]] into a [[movie]]. I had to stop the tape numerous [[times]] during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect for [[witnessing]] such [[atrocious]] dialogue as there is [[found]] here.<br /><br />Furthermore, the [[collection]] of characters is so formulaic and one-dimensional it's ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we [[know]] she's his ""assistant"" because he repeatedly refers to her by that title); the [[recently-widowed]] businessman with a [[heart]] of [[gold]] who [[develops]] a romantic interest with [[Blair's]] character; his criminal son; the Blair [[character's]] alcoholic, abusive, unemployed boyfriend, whom we are introduced to in the most contrived use of a flashback; and, of [[course]], the rough, tough, bearded security guard who [[becomes]] the hero.<br /><br />[[Apparently]], the [[preserving]] fluid which some cryogenics [[lab]] [[uses]] on its [[bodies]] is highly [[conductive]], [[naturally]] [[resulting]] in [[disaster]] when all of the [[lab's]] [[containers]] [[end]] up [[outdoors]] in a remarkable sequence of [[events]] during a [[lightning]] storm (on [[Halloween]] night, no [[less]]).

[[Let]] me tell you, the steel [[mill]] scene in ""T2"" has got [[nothing]] on ""The Chilling"" in [[portraying]] an enemy [[getting]] frozen in his [[tracks]] like that.<br /><[[br]] />How [[Linda]] [[Blair]] [[ended]] up [[stuck]] in the [[middle]] of this [[piece]] of [[dreck]] is [[indeed]] a [[mystery]]. True, her [[career]] didn't exactly skyrocket during the [[80s]] (sadly), but this movie is an embarrassment for her. The [[script]] doesn't [[even]] have the [[decency]] to put her to any good use. The most that her character is given to do is shriek out things like ""Here they come"", ""Do something"", ""Hurry!"". The only thing I can figure is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in rations of food. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this picture, he faces stiff acting competition from his beard and the security dog, and he does his best to outperform them both.<br /><br />The only frightening part of ""The Chilling"" is the introduction which brings up the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that ""the film you are about to see could happen in your own community"".

[[Even]] if you are a die hard Alien/Pred [[fan]] [[like]] I am wait for the DVD. It isn't worth a 3.99 rental [[either]] but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus [[concession]] purchases at a [[theater]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />In the theater I [[watched]] AVPr there were exactly [[two]] laughs, both by a [[girl]] sitting [[next]] to me. [[Other]] than that there was [[total]] silence throughout. No [[ooohs]], or ""that was bad ass!"", [[nothing]]. [[Imagine]] being a patient on an operating [[table]] and just being given the anesthetic. Now you know what you'll feel [[like]] in the theater after the opening [[scene]] of AVPr.<[[br]] /><br />[[What]] was the budget on this [[movie]]? [[Like]] [[War]] of the Worlds, MI [[3]], and other [[f]]/[[x]] driven movies the director [[seems]] [[far]] more [[involved]] in what the CGI [[people]] can come up with than [[developing]] characters or a [[plot]]. Spielberg has tried and failed at this [[several]] [[times]], usually with Tom [[Cruise]]. [[Sure]] the movies make [[money]] but should they? [[War]] of the [[Worlds]] and [[Minority]] [[Report]] had the [[budget]] to pay for a decent [[script]], Tom Cruise [[et]] al, and SS himself but were still [[awful]]. [[I'm]] sure [[AVP]] wasted 90% of their [[budget]] on CG and had no choice but to hire any [[actor]] that would say yes even though the [[casting]] agent would have [[done]] better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at [[random]].<[[br]] /><br />There is no [[tension]] developed in any scene so we are never close to being [[surprised]]. Who cares who [[gets]] killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the [[lil]] aliens make their [[corporeal]] exit, we all know the blood is [[acid]]. [[In]] Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even [[AVP]] the directors make use of the fact that the [[Aliens]] can think, can hide and can lay [[traps]]. This director [[decided]] that the Ridley Scott, [[James]] [[Cameron]], and others were [[idiots]] for developing characters you [[actually]] want to [[see]] either [[live]] or [[get]] killed. In this installment you will [[never]] [[care]] who [[lives]] or dies, not a [[kid]], a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. [[The]] opening scenes [[establish]] the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. The character development scenes mix clich√©s, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways.

"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it even if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists [[share]]. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and [[1999]] (with a young Milla [[Jovovich]]). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no [[contact]] with [[civilization]], ""[[Friends]]"" [[goes]] the [[opposite]] route and it is [[sure]] to ring [[much]] more [[true]] and be a more difficult [[movie]] with contemporary audiences. Paul and Michelle who, for [[different]] reasons, turn their [[backs]] on [[family]] and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in Southern France. [[Having]] only each other and their childhood innocence, their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves, in this sweet coming of age story. This film even to this day is controversial since the actors are teenagers and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie (15 and 14 1/2). The movie does contains a hint of child molesting, nudity, depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. But the real controversy is not the subject matter but the fact that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island, having them in a modern setting presents some very difficult moral issues. Laws prohibiting consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to prevent child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will feel uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough [[gem]]. The script progresses with extreme simplicity, [[albeit]] some sappiness, but [[never]] [[pulling]] any [[punches]] to [[state]] its message, [[although]] by today standards, it is [[somewhat]] slow. The [[photography]] is [[beautiful]] and it has scenes of [[great]] [[beauty]]. The [[acting]] of the two [[protagonists]] [[varies]] from really awful in some [[scenes]] to [[marvelously]] [[innocent]] and credible in others.

(now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.<br /><br />not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.<br /><br />other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.",0

"[[This]] groundbreaking [[film]] is [[truly]] a [[work]] of [[art]]. I went into the screening at the convention in Indiana with very low expectations, having already viewed 2 other film with ""gamer"" in the title (both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one I had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper [[clip]] I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits ""Dorkness"" had me. [[The]] temperate Northwest [[setting]] made a [[beautiful]] backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master, [[Lodge]]([[powerfully]] portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his misfit band of friends who set aside the real-life dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting Lodge provides for them. After the first scene(set in the fantasy world they inhabit) They are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape. This drew so many comparisons to my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice's acting is of such [[amazing]] caliber that I truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty-something male suffering from frustration, male pattern baldness and an annoying group of ""friends"" that can't seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong. Lodge's friends are of some note here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, aside from lodge. Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary, the youngest of the group. This seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that Gary is, in fact, a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his ""fantasy"" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors who [[portray]] Leo (Scott C. Brown) and [[Gary]] (christian [[Doyle]]) seem to play the characters for laughs at [[times]], as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a [[hard-hitting]] action/drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's motley crew. the tension is always high when he is on screen, both when he is arguing passionately about his beliefs to Lodge or when displaying his fantastic Martial Arts skills as ""Silence"" his fantasy character. Or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you reflexively duck in the audience so as not to get smacked by his fantastic chin. Lewis Lights up the screen no matter what he's doing and I hope to see more of him in the future. Once the action begins in this movie, it just doesn't quit. the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you can's tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment.

"In order to describe what's seriously [[wrong]] with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this!<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. It is well acted, if a bit slow moving, and the camera work and Portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget, unpretentious picture. The dialog is very good. <br /><br />Mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance. His high school buddy, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that Mason is quite obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a perky, pretty girl named Amber and he sketches her in his notebook. She takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state, almost becoming halfway human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She becomes frightened and pulls away. We are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /><br />This is the setup for the revelation. In order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong I have to explain what happens. *Another spoiler warning!* In order for this plot to work we have believe that Amber, a really outgoing, pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesn't speak at all. He's way beyond nerdy, he appears on the verge of total catatonia. Yes I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there at all. Any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. It is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. Moreover there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge the crazy Mason, that just isn't believable either. <br /><br />But wait, there's a revelation. Amber fails to show up at Berkeley's house for Christmas dinner where Mason is expecting her and Berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, don't exist at all! She and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. <br /><br />Well, this explains why a normal cute Amber would go for Mason, she's just a figment of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, it's not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there...he's enraged, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was in fact real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /><br />In the end, after being given proof that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been halfway sane from the beginning, but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. We suspected what he was all along and can't understand why Berkeley couldn't see it. But then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real, why Amber would be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /><br />To make the ending worse, we are never given to understand whether all the other of Mason's girlfriends, the ones in the sketchbooks, were real or was Amber the first real one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /><br />The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material.

"[[Whether]] one [[views]] him as a gallant cavalier of the [[plains]] or a glory [[hunting]] egomaniac, debates about the [[life]] and military career of [[George]] [[Armstrong]] Custer continue down to the present day. [[They]] [[Died]] [[With]] Their [[Boots]] On presents certain [[facts]] of the [[Custer]] story and has taken liberty with others.<br /><[[br]] />He did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at [[West]] [[Point]] and [[got]] this overnight [[promotion]] on the [[battlefield]] to Brigadier General. [[His]] record [[leading]] the [[Michigan]] [[Regiment]] under his command was one of [[brilliance]].<br /><br />It was [[also]] true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the [[great]] love matches of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until [[The]] Little Big [[Horn]]. What's not [[known]] to today's audience is that Libby [[survived]] until 1933. [[During]] that [[time]] she was the custodian of the Custer legend. By dint of her own [[iron]] will and force of [[personality]] her late husband became a [[hero]] because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other [[way]].<br /><br />I [[think]] Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have the Custer career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have been made up the way Jeanette MacDonald was in Maytime, and be telling the story of her [[husband]] and her marriage from the [[point]] of [[view]] of nostalgia and [[remembrance]]. [[Even]] then the [[cracks]] in the [[Custer]] legend were [[appearing]], but if done from [[Libby's]] point of view, they could be [[understood]] and forgiven.<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet [[gave]] a [[fine]] [[performance]] as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing whatsoever to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by [[George]] B. McClellan in [[late]] 1861 while Custer was still at [[West]] Point. I'm not sure they [[ever]] [[met]]. [[But]] Greenstreet does a [[good]] characterization of the ponderous and powerful Winfield Scott. A nice Mexican War story should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old Fuss and Feathers.<br /><br />The film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Both their performances, Olivia's especially, was a high point in their careers at Warner Brothers.

[[Thy]] [[Di–µd]] [[Wit’∞]] Their [[Boot—ï]] On presents certain [[fact—ï]] of the [[Custe‚≤Ö]] story and has taken liberty with others.<br /><[[b‚≤Ö]] />He did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at [[Wesùöù]] [[Poinùöù]] and [[goùöù]] this overnight [[promoùöùion]] on the [[battlefiel‘Å]] to Brigadier General. [[Hi—ï]] record [[lea‘Åing]] the [[Miœ≤higan]] [[Regimenùöù]] under his command was one of [[brilli…ënce]].<br /><br />It was [[al—ïo]] true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the [[greaùöù]] love matches of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years until [[Te]] Little Big [[Hon]]. What's not [[kno‘ùn]] to today's audience is that Libby [[sur—µived]] until 1933. [[Du‚≤Öing]] that [[tiÔΩçe]] she was the custodian of the Custer legend. By dint of her own [[i‚≤Öon]] will and force of [[personaliùöùy]] her late husband became a [[he‚≤Öo]] because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other [[‘ùay]].<br /><br />I [[thinùíå]] Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity to have the Custer career told in flashback. Olivia DeHavilland should have been made up the way Jeanette MacDonald was in Maytime, and be telling the story of her [[husban‘Å]] and her marriage from the [[poinùöù]] of [[vie‘ù]] of nostalgia and [[remembranœ≤e]]. [[E—µen]] then the [[crack—ï]] in the [[Custe‚≤Ö]] legend were [[appea‚≤Öing]], but if done from [[Libby`s]] point of view, they could be [[understoo‘Å]] and forgiven.<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet [[ga—µe]] a [[fin–µ]] [[performa]] [[nce]] as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing whatsoever to do with Custer, he was retired and replaced by [[Geo‚≤Öge]] B. McClellan in [[laùöùe]] 1861 while Custer was still at [[Wet]] Point. I'm not sure they [[eve‚≤Ö]] [[mt]]. [[Bt]] Greenstreet does a [[goo‘Å]] characterization of the ponderous and powerful Winfield Scott. A nice Mexican War story should have been what they gave Greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old Fuss and Feathers.<br /><br />The film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. This was the last of eight films they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. Both their performances, Olivia's especially, was a high point in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is riding to his doom, that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy.

"Out of the [[handful]] of alternative [[titles]] in [[English]], ""[[The]] [[Sexorcist]]"" is definitely the most [[appropriate]] one, since this is [[basically]] just a [[shameless]] [[rip]] off of [[William]] [[Friedkin's]] classic horror film in which they [[replaced]] [[13-year-old]] Linda Blair with the [[19-year-old]] [[Stella]] [[Carnacina]] only so that she could [[gratuitously]] show her ravishing naked body. [[I'm]] not sure what exactly Satan tries to [[accomplish]] here, but he exclusively seems to possess the young [[girl]] to play sexual tricks on her! [[Poor]] Danila [[masturbates]] around the clock and [[tries]] to seduce priests and even her own [[father]] into having sex with her. The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious [[theology-student]] with an [[odd-looking]] boyfriend ([[driving]] a [[stupid]] yellow [[car]]) and loving, albeit [[adulterous]] parents. [[When]] she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the [[ancient]] relic [[comes]] to life and no [[less]] than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Planet of the Vampires"") starts to torment her. The [[overlong]] masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences [[cover]] about three quarters of the movie, and then finally director Mario Garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. That final [[segment]] is even more [[embarrassing]] and [[amateurish]]! The priests don't [[really]] do anything [[apart]] from saying some vague [[prayers]] but, [[somehow]], [[Danila]] seems cured all of a sudden.

The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious [[theolog—É-student]] with an [[odd-looùíåing]] boyfriend ([[dri—µing]] a [[stupi‘Å]] yellow [[ca‚≤Ö]]) and loving, albeit [[adlterous]] parents. [[Wen]] she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the [[ancienùöù]] relic [[come—ï]] to life and no [[les]] than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Planet of the Vampires"") starts to torment her.

"The Tempest has been interpreted in many different ways ranging from more or less traditional views as dealing with Art to more post-modern approaches that like to dissect the play along post-colonial, feminist, gender or deconstructionist lines.

"I hate films about sports. I [[guess]] the pre-fabricated [[Hollywood]] sports film is a [[bit]] tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this [[genre]]. Use exhibit ""A"" ¬ñ ""[[The]] Game Plan"" as [[evidence]] of this if you [[want]]. So, needless to [[say]], I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the [[sports]] theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey"". I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at [[first]] I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while [[using]] amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths.<br /><br />Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me. This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.<br /><br />Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend.

As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.<br /><br />Grade: *** ¬Ω out of *****","I hate films about sports. I [[gues—ï]] the pre-fabricated [[Holly]] [[wood]] sports film is a [[b—ñt]] tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this [[gerne]]. Use exhibit ""A"" ¬ñ ""[[Te]] Game Plan"" as [[ev—ñdence]] of this if you [[wa’∏t]]. So, needless to [[sy]], I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the [[spots]] theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey"". I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at [[fisrt]] I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while [[us]] [[ing]] amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths.<br /><br />Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me. This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.<br /><br />Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again ¬ñ they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time.

"Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldn't help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the ""performers"" featured here. Stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation all [[right--she]] is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though, it has to be said, her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young, would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers, Andrea and Jane, have such [[annoying]] voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get in front of Morrissey's camera anyway.

Oh well....<br /><br />I [[loved]] this [[movie-and]] would see it again and again-but I know [[that's]] purely based on my own personal [[tastes-Rock]] Star is a movie that will appeal to anyone who has experienced elements of the rock or hard rock lifestyle and wants to go down the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a movie that effectively captures that(long forgot by many non-rock fans.) time effectively, as I [[think]] that Rock Star has [[done]]. That is one of the [[film's]] [[strengths]], the concert footage. You will [[feel]] [[like]] your right there with them and how [[could]] any [[hard]] rock fan not [[love]] that? As far as setting the atmosphere Rock Star gets a 10 of 10. It also gets a 10 of 10 for [[pure]] entertainment. If you want a movie to just [[let]] yourself go and free flow into some [[great]] memories of [[good]] times [[past]], then this is the movie for you. It is also the [[reason]] why I [[loved]] this [[movie]] so.<[[br]] /><br />But it isn't a great [[movie]]. I [[understand]] that and were it my actual job to review movies professionally, [[I'd]] probably have to be a [[bit]] hard on this one. The problem with Rock star is the character development.<br /><br />What is wrong with the character development is this, there isn't any. None. [[The]] [[movie]] has certain [[scenes-few]] and [[far]] between but they ARE [[there-that]] DO [[touch]] on [[greatness]]:WARNING BRIEF SCENE SPOILERS: 3 [[examples-]] 1)when Izzy makes his debut on stage(including the fall he [[takes]])<br /><br />[[2]])The first ""after show"" party with Emily(Anniston and Izzy.)<br /><[[br]] />3)Backtracking a little-In the beginning when the original lead singer is casually dismissed(fired)-the whole ""business as usual"" tone sets the stage for what's to come. It's played very effectively.<br /><br />But the problem is, nothing ever does come. There is little to no character development of anyone in this movie, peoples' persona's are merely touched on, but never fully explored. I don't think that's the fault of the actors/actresses,particularly Anniston who tries hard, they just are not given much to work with. It's just that the script was weak and lacked the ability to go beyond the ""formula"" feel into true movie depth. Rock star was so sugarcoated at times(including towards the end) it was almost ridiculous. And , though, those scenes I mentioned WERE outstanding and very believable, sadly much else in the movie wasn't.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned the lack of buildup towards the end and I agree but there was actually a lack of buildup about ANYTHING. WHY does Izzy leave at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band won't let him write songs? It tests the limits of believability. And, frankly the end was just corny. Made no sense and had no reality to it at all.<br /><br />Watching this, it's almost like watching a movie where the makers of it said: OK, this happens here and then this happens and then this etc etc etc. By the end it's no longer a movie about a boy who's dream came true, it's just another thickly formulated love story. And you wonder why so much detail is left out....<br /><br />I hope I'm not being to hard on Rock Star because I truly loved it-but not for the right reasons. I would have liked to love this as a great movie about the highs and lows of rock fame. Instead I loved it for it's 80's period feel, the clothes, the hair, the lights, the life.... Although many others loved it to, I suspect most are people who lived the life of a rock fan, like I did or some who play. I'd have liked to see the movie cross over and just be respected for being a good, well told movie, instead of a clich√©. I think, one of the problems was the length. I myself, hate over long films but this was one that really should have been longer, if a movie is done really right, the length is not even felt-there is just to much to the story for it to be as short as it was-that's one reason why there doesn't seem to be much development of either the story or the human beings portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />So-to wind down-this is a movie you can greatly get into- but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. See it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it WAS life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.","What to say about a movie like Rock Star?

"While the ""date doctor"" concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, I found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so I ended up liking it a lot more than if [[it'd]] had just a mediocre plot without [[many]] twists. Will Smith does a [[great]] [[job]], as [[always]], acting as [[Hitch]], the man who [[devotes]] his life to advising men how and how not to win over women...ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend. There're [[plenty]] of [[laughs]] as he tries to [[help]] his latest patient, overweight, gawky asthmatic Albert [[Brennman]] (Kevin James) successfully court beautiful [[co-worker]] [[Allegra]] Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around, he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it appears to be a big deal for him, so I guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in ""the date doctor"" who got a seemingly dorky guy like Albert together with Allegra - especially AFTER player/jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks her [[best]] friend's (Julie Ann Emery) heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him, when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him. Still, trouble follows and Hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship, while not being any great help to Albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his. The acting is [[good]], there's a [[great]] deal of humor and some other [[fine]] points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, [[sometimes]] managing to be both at once. True, the misunderstanding where the woman is affronted at something the man hasn't truly done (why do they always show that?) as common and irritating - guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st, not 5th, time I've seen IT - but the rest of them were completely new. I only wish this movie was [[longer]] - I [[remember]] being able to watch 3/5 of it while it was playing on a restaurant's TV once - but I still approve.

"I rented this film courtesy of Netflix, thinking I would receive the 1972 version. I sat clueless, watching this new version, thinking: Gee, the production values were spectacular! I was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly 70s' sound to it. I was even more convinced that this was a 70s film when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that the one thing that was missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a loaded stare, a passionate kiss.<br /><br />I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually adolescents) of the same sex have ""intense"" friendships, it means that those longings for love, togetherness, the desire to express oneself sexually, are all spilling over. These boys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to.<br /><br />Also, despite a spirited performance by Toby Moore, I [[never]] felt any of the emotions were real. I never [[connected]] to [[either]] of the boys, for the very reason their relationship was not truly honest.<br /><br />People want to live in a fantasy and think that because this took place in the 1940s that these boys couldn't have had these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they did -- at least in the book they did, and in this movie, Finney had them, almost [[painfully]], for Gene. [[The]] ""[[intensity]]"" that [[John]] Knowles suggests existed between them was a closet homosexuality, a hero [[worship]], an [[idolatry]] -- that [[would]], under [[normal]] circumstances, be expressed in a sexual way. Even if these boys were repressing it, it should have been crystal clear, but this movie doesn't even really hint at it. <br /><br />[[Lastly]], there is an [[unbelievably]] [[bizarre]] moment when Finney, who has broken his leg, is playfully [[jumped]] on by all the other boys during a ball [[game]]. [[Unless]] they were just a [[bunch]] of [[nincompoops]], they [[would]] [[know]] they could not [[possibly]] [[throw]] their bodies against him.

"Zachary Scott does what he does best, i.e., plays a worm, in ""Danger Signal,"" a 1945 B movie also starring Faye Emerson, Mona Freeman, and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. On the lam from his last murder, he rents a room in the home owned by the Fenchurch family, Hilda (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott throws himself at Emerson, and she's dazzled. Mid-romance, her younger sister Anne (Freeman) comes home from a medical treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite and he left her $25,000 (big bucks by 1945 standards), Scott loses interest in poor Hilda and makes a play for Anne. Anne looks like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm until she starts sneaking around with Scott - overnight, she ages 10 years and becomes downright nasty to her sister. Finally getting the message that her tenant is no good, [[Hilda]] calls in a psychiatrist ([[Rosemary]] DeCamp) to psyche him out and [[advise]] her.<br /><br />Psychological dramas were all the rage during and after World War II, and Scott does an [[excellent]] job as a smooth sociopath. This was his forte - as a weak-willed sheriff in ""Flamingo Road,"" he exhibited no real presence. As for two-timing, we saw him do that in ""Mildred Pierce,"" where he [[proved]] himself particularly good at it.

"A remake of the 1916 silent film, based on the 1909 novel by Maurice Leblanc. The detective series would be made into numerous plays, films and TV series in the UK, the US, and France over the years. This 1932 version starred the smashing Barrymore brothers John (as the Duke) and Lionel (as Detective Guerchard). They would also star together in Grand Hotel, Dinner at Eight, and several others over the next couple years. Sonia (Karen Morley) shows up in the Duke's bed during a party in this pre-Hayes code film; first the lights go out in the bedroom, then they go out in the main ballroom, then the search is on for the crook and the missing jewelry, as well as other missing valuables... You can tell talkies hadn't been around too long, as they still use caption cards several times. Also watch for a new kind of safe that doesn't need a combination.

"This picture hit the movie screens on June 6th 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and starring Playmate of the year Dorothy Stratton. The picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for I guess criminals. There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan [[stupid]] and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're into Sci-Fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Sci-fi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such [[garbage]]. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her [[talents]] would have been wasted [[also]]. On the picture alone I give this [[movie]] [[1]] weasel [[star]] and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this.

"This is about some vampires (who can run around out in the sunlight), that are causing some problems down in South America. Casper Van Dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate. The movie opens with Van Dien & Co. walking through the jungle, and there's this huge black guy who just absolutely, positively [[cannot]] act. He speaks all his lines as if he's reading them off the cue-cards for the very first time. His voice is also so low that, well, it's positively hilarious. Great way to get the movie started! Anyhow, they run into some of our vampires, shoot them (this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds), and then of course they come back to life. Van Dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb, and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood. The stunt work must be seen to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees, which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily, but it just [[makes]] them look like they're bouncing around on bungee cords or something.<br /><br />Yeah...anyhow, later on, the huge black dude is down in South America with some guys (Van Dien not included), and they're attacked by more vampires. It's really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow, because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with, but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand. The big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader. Van Dien ends up battling him later on. It doesn't help that all through the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so, which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly [[easily]]. They just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of [[hand-to-hand]] combat. Yeah, not [[exactly]] brilliant [[tactics]].<[[br]] /><br />There's a hot babe (remember Veronica from [[The]] [[Lost]] [[World]] TV [[show]]? Yes, it's her!) who also happens to be [[walking]] around in the [[middle]] of Vampire County on some sort of research mission, and she also just happens to be Van Dien's ex-wife. Hey, what are the odds? It's a shame she's not in the movie a whole lot more than she is. Will her and Casper get back together in the end? Will Van Dien defeat the huge black dude who can't act? Will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes? Will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny? Has even Lynda Carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo (she's more convincing in her Sleep Number Bed commercials)?

"[[It]] is in the opinion of this reviewer that the [[best]] time to be a [[child]] was in the [[1990's]], a [[period]] when [[cartoons]] were not heavily censored and [[talented]] and [[creative]] [[minds]] were responsible for some of the [[best]] family entertainment to [[hit]] the [[air-waves]]. The [[best]] [[producers]] of Saturday morning animation were at Warner Brothers Television, who experienced a major Golden Age with the dream-team of Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger and Paul [[Dini]]. Along with serious and dark series [[like]] Batman, they also revived [[zany]], outlandish [[cartoons]] [[made]] [[famous]] by the Looney Tunes. Animaniacs was the biggest hitter with its dark adult humour and homages to the celluloid of yesteryear and [[today]], but Tiny Toon [[Adventures]] was [[equally]] [[popular]] by re-inventing the Looney Tunes for a [[new]] generation, while still keeping that [[crazy]] cartoon violence and [[intelligent]] comedy that can hold onto any age group, no matter how old. Even when the Tiny [[Toons]] were stretched to a feature-length with How I Spent My Vacation, it did not feel like a longer episode of the television series, a curse that so often plagues other [[feature-length]] adaptations of popular animated [[shows]].<[[br]] /><br />[[The]] Tiny Toon Gang are young off-springs of the classic cartoon characters who made audiences laugh back in the 1940's and 1950's and are currently learning cartoon comedy to ""earn their Toon Degree."" Summer Vacation has started and each character has their own idea of what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and [[Babs]] Bunny (Tress [[MacNeille]]) start a water gun fight which ultimately leads to [[Acme]] Acres [[getting]] flooded and them both sailing down the Mississippi. [[Plucky]] Duck (Joe Alaskey) joins Hamton Pig (Don Messick) on a [[cross-country]] car trip to the [[Happiest]] Theme [[Park]] in the World, but Hamton's family proves to be more difficult than he imagined. Meanwhile, in other stories scattered [[throughout]], Elmyra Duff (Cree Summer) tries to find a cat to hug and [[squeeze]], Fifi Le Fume (Kath Soucie) attempts to go out on a date with her [[favourite]] skunk star and Shirley the Loon (Gail Matthius) goes to the cinema with a loud-mouth Fowlmouth (Rob Paulen).<br /><br />[[While]] the premise sounds thin for a feature-length film, the many directors and screenwriters make all the stories work well together. The best of these is Plucky's unfortunate road trip, which utilises a golden comedic opportunity very well: feeling pity for somebody, while also laughing at their predicament. Plucky's annoyed reaction to all the bad things that happen to him are a perfect blend of script and animation, all in the confines of a small car stuffed with pork. Elmyra's story definitely ranks second just to see how a little, almost innocent girl can cause fear into so many jungle animals. The aforementioned cartoon violence definitely comes to the fore-front with Buster and Babs' story, which makes us smile not only due to the hilarity of the outcomes, but also nostalgically, since Ruegger and company would probably not be allowed to show half of what they do in that segment. Practically half of that segment plays as a parody and homage to Deliverance, including a clever twist on the dueling banjos scene, featuring the unforgettable Tiny [[Toon]] [[Adventures]] theme song.<[[br]] /><br />Part of the universal appeal of the Tiny Toons is that the humour proves to be very intelligent as it targets subjects with a ferocity that proves that it does not at all deserve the title of ""children's fare"" that people seem to slap it with. An entire segment featuring Fowlmouth's poor etiquette at the cinema pokes fun at yappers in a note-perfect way, along with an additional jab at Lucasfilm's THX logo. That scene is done so perfectly that it should be featured before every cinema showing. There are also a couple of moments that poke fun at Disney World, cinematic plot holes and even Warner's legal department. The fact that today's cartoons are bland and un-creative makes those intelligent moments even more treasuring as there probably will not be another animated series that will come close.<br /><br />After watching How I Spent My Vacation for the first time in many years, I can say with all certainty that they do not make cartoons quite like they used to. With the ongoing censorship that today's family entertainment receive, one wonders whether anything like this will ever be made again. This review is not only a recommendation of a truly smart film, but also a plea for Spielberg, Ruegger and Dini to team up again and bring forth a magical creation to our minds once again.

"Much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered once again, why remake a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off.

"Have you ever watched a film, when after it's conclusion, your left pondering what in the world it was all about? Well, say hello to ""Scream, Baby, Scream"".

"It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before then, there was too much Hays Code-constricted pap.

"""A lot of the films [[I've]] made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago, and [[that's]] just because I have a lot of [[old-fashion]] values."" - Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Some points..<br /><br />1. Though this film is a loose remake of ""A Guy Named Joe"", it also borrows heavily from ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and ""Wings of Desire"".<br /><br />2. This was Spielberg's second attempt at being Frank Capra. <br /><br />3. Spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a ""Frank Capra movie"" in the vein of ""[[It's]] A Wonderful Life"" and ""Mrs Smith Goes To Washington"". Judging from his recent attempts to get a ""Harvey"" remake off the ground, it seems as though Spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 ventures into [[Capracorn]].<br /><br />4. Critics at the time bashed ""Always"", stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance, but that's really not the problem at all. The [[problem]] is that ""Always"" needs a [[lot]] more [[special]] effects to [[distract]] [[us]] from the fact that Spielberg [[can't]] film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an exclamation point.<br /><br />5. The film is filled with comedy that just doesn't [[work]]. [[Spielberg's]] comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated, and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's screwballs and Looney Tune cartoons. These [[exaggerated]] antics [[may]] [[work]] in a cartoon [[universe]], but in a film it just [[seems]] [[like]] an odd marriage.<br /><br />6. [[The]] film's lead [[couple]] [[come]] across as brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films have always being apprehensive toward sex and intimacy, but this film goes to extreme lengths: she's a wisecracking tomboy and he's a wisecracking old man. They're more [[irritating]] than endearing.<[[br]] /><br />7. The film contains one good scene, in which John Goodman [[argues]] with Holly Hunter, but for the most part the film's characters are too [[annoying]].

After their failure (and the twin financial failures of ""The Color Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"") Spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of ""Color Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" in favour for the more desaturated ""black and white"" worlds of ""Schindler's List"", ""Munich"", ""Minority Report"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". From here on, ""less light"" and ""dark cinematography"" became equated with ""serious topics"".<br /><br />9. After the financial success of each ""dark film"" Spielberg reverts back to his colour cinematography, and falls flat on his face once again. ""Amistad"" followed ""Schindler's List"", ""AI"" followed ""Ryan"" and ""Lincoln"" will follow ""Munich"". These ""colour"" films are always bashed for being too tacky, sentimental, corny and hokey, but the truth is, if you removed the desaturation, all these ""serious"" films would feel the same way.<br /><br />10. Since the 70s, Spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other brat pack directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola etc), by pretending to be an ""optimist"" and ""humanist"". He would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s. The reality, though, is that he is probably the biggest sadist of all these directors, the very form of his films often undermining their content, their very box office performances always proportionate to their dazzling displays of carnage. <br /><br />11. The failure of Spielberg to connect with any of the characters in ""Always"", and the relish he shows, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks etc...this is what Spielberg delights in. The moment his characters stop to speak, however, everything self-destructs. A film like ""Amistad"" failed, in other words, because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked.<br /><br />12.

"In [[Luchino]] [[Visconti's]] film Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays, but in the pursuit of beauty itself Gustav von Aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man. To understand the decay, we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us, it is best described, and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, ""beauty alone, is lovely and visible at once¬Ö it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses¬Ö Else what¬Öif the divine, if reason and virtue and truth were to [[speak]] to us through the senses? Should we not perish and become consumed by love?"" We see in the film this very thing happen, the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty, which turns into a longing for the [[boy]], Tadzio. Even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of [[beauty]] can lead to sensuousness and abandon, he [[cannot]] contain himself. <br /><br />It would be [[easy]] to describe this as a beautiful film; early on we see the extravagance of the parlor, and we are treated to a [[perfect]] summarization of [[turn-of-the]] century upper class [[life]], all captured on [[film]] perfectly by [[cinematographer]] Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. The city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff. The streets [[become]] exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous [[man]]. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music [[allow]] us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /><br />Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has in depth conversations on the [[meaning]] of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's [[alter-ego]], and what [[Alfred]] says [[articulates]] the [[composer's]] own [[doubts]] and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach [[decides]] to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred telling him that he is weak, alienated and lacks feelings. In the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It is a decay of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are decayed memories because even Aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, ""reality distracts and degrades us;"" and, following the scene in the travel agent's office we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination, he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. He allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch Aschenbach's life and respectability decay with the beauty around him. <br /><br />Slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth. The crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man's attraction to Tadzio, it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy kindles a fire in him that, at first, makes him glow, then consumes him. The film concludes with von Aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood, it is a vision of his life's expiring moments, though before his last breath. The final decay has happened, all around him the city is soiled, and with it he has become what he detests. As Aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man that had disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay, in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise, and that of the city around him; his sensuality is indulged in, while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that tie The Damned and Death in Venice together, beauty, death, and decay, these themes are Visconti's art, the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself. <br /><br />In this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable, lonely death watching the target of his affection. I believe that through these movies Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last. Decay is intrinsic in the world around us, and when we become distracted, it can destroy the splendor. In Death in Venice, it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in Visconti's works, at once beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define his art.","In [[L]] [[uchino]] [[Vis]] [[conti's]] film Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays, but in the pursuit of beauty itself Gustav von Aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man.

"I took my family to see Barnyard this past weekend. We had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there, my husband and I would have left. Coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male bovine in the film having udders drawn on them was a little disturbing. We felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something. It was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on a different website, I felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact. I know this is just an animated, humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male, I had to suspend my disbelief so much that I just couldn't [[enjoy]] the movie like I might have. I know udders can be found funny but they were definitely over [[used]]. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and I would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all.

"[[This]] was a [[great]] film in [[every]] sense of the word. [[It]] [[tackles]] the [[subject]] of tribadism in a [[society]] that is [[quite]] [[intolerant]] of any deviations from the norm. [[It]] criticises a great many Indian customs that many [[find]] [[oppressive]] -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. [[At]] the heart of the film is a [[touching]] [[love]] story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists [[find]] themselves. The film is [[well-acted]] and genuine, [[completely]] believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main [[faults]] of the film as I saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not ""turn homosexual"". It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that ""without desire she was dead"", and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- [[quite]] the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named ""Jesus"" and another named ""Paul""!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie.

"This movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about why, but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors [[ridiculously]] tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault. Not far into the movie Oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier, and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film. I know many will argue that it's not that important in a kung fu beat-em-up, and as a fan of the genera I can't say that it's all that unusual, but that doesn't [[stop]] it from being completely [[tasteless]] every time I see it.<br /><br />What I will say in this movie's defence however is that it's somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts, or even action movie of any sort, that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police. The final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy-dog like devotion.<br /><br />Whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not, one can't help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over. This is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated. If only Karate Bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved, or by leaving it out all together, this would have been a much more interesting film.","This movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about why, but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors [[ridiculou—ïly]] tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault.

"Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - ""Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend"" gives us a look at the tremendous, all-American star through his films and his life. Narrated by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely ""Gary Coooper, American"" as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in [[westerns]], and scenes from ""Meet John Doe,"" ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, and ""Sgt. York."" The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos, showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life. There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on ""The Jack Benny Show"" doing the comeback on the number ""Bird Dog"" - and Benny loses it. The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal, which nearly ruined both their lives.<br /><br />There's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio/retrospective - it jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed, which would have added a lot. Also, Clint Eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive. What it was, was boring and monotone. Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong, silent type on screen, we could have used a little animation.<br /><br />On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived - there were some looks at him in his early films, but not nearly enough for this fan. [[That]] smile, those [[lips]], that bone structure - he was [[handsome]] throughout his life, but in films like ""Morocco"" and ""Desire,"" he is [[devastating]]. Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances, as Howard Roark in ""The Fountainhead,"" giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand - a young, suave Cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch.

"We [[see]] at the beginning of Little Dieter Needs to Fly Dieter Dengler, the subject of the [[film]], an [[obsessive-compulsive]]. Or at [[least]] that's what he [[seems]] to be by way of [[constantly]] opening/[[closing]] [[doors]] and with his large [[stock-pile]] of food in the [[cellar]]. In a [[way]] director Werner [[Herzog]] sets up a [[central]] [[question]], in a manner of [[speaking]], to why Dieter is [[like]] this. Well, in [[fact]], he's not necessarily [[obsessive-compulsive]] as he is just, well, [[prepared]]. [[And]] why shouldn't he be after the [[life]] [[he's]] [[lived]]? Aside from the juiciest, most dark and [[exhilarating]] and frightening and just downright [[haunting]] [[story]] of [[survival]] [[that's]] the [[core]] of the picture, the [[back-story]] to Dieter is [[fascinating]] too. [[Dieter's]] own [[childhood]], for [[example]], was already a slog from the [[start]], being in [[post-war]] [[Germnay]], poor in a family [[without]] [[much]] food or prospects, [[eating]] wallpaper for ""the [[blue]] in the walls"". [[But]] enter in a [[passion]], an [[un-yielding]] [[desire]] (which, of [[course]], is [[part]] of Herzog's [[bread]] & [[butter]] and [[love]] of [[man]] in his films), which is flying, and for [[Dieter]] there was [[nothing]] [[else]] but to [[fulfill]] this. [[What]] it [[ends]] up [[leading]] to, after [[becoming]] an American citizen, is more than he could've bargained for.<br /><br />Dieter is one of [[Herzog's]] most [[compelling]], quirky, and compassionately [[observed]] [[figures]] in his whole career, a man who's [[memory]] is [[scarred]] by [[brutal]] [[memories]] of his [[time]] being a Vietnam POW, though at the least it provides for some of the most [[compelling]] storytelling in any documentary of the [[last]] [[20]] years. Ironically, the storytelling [[comes]] through- unlike in [[The]] [[Wild]] [[Blue]] [[Yonder-]] [[mostly]] in [[lots]] and [[lots]] of exposition from Dieter on some of the most [[minute]] [[details]] of his time in the [[different]] [[prison]] camps (the [[torture]] tactics, the [[bugs]], the [[brutal]], wretched violence and threats [[like]] with the wedding ring [[tale]]), and leading into the most [[interesting]] and [[sad]] portions with his best [[friend]] Duane. [[They]] [[escaped]] the [[prisons]] [[together]], but [[found]] that their [[journey]] to [[reach]] Cambodia [[would]] not be so [[easy]]. [[Now]], through most of this, the [[talking]] does [[something]] that is [[enthralling]], which is that as Dieter goes through his [[stories]] and [[occasionally]] does [[re-enactments]] (in [[fashion]] [[Herzog]] [[could]] only do, with Dieter already middle-aged being led in handcuffs et all through the jungle), one can picture all of this in the mind. It all becomes even more vivid to try and get these little details and the intensity of it all together into a form of reality. That Herzog keeps these portions simple, and knows when to hold Dieter back in his answers, makes him all the more a key figure of interest. He's not ever totally 'normal', but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you wont think ever really about laughing at him either.<br /><br />So, along with his hero (whether of war or not is hard to say, as Dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes, typical but perhaps quite true), Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing Dieter's early life (the period footage of [[WW2]] scenes and post German rubble is always a captivating sight, and with Herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music), and in capturing the footage of Vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings, there's no 'I was used by the Americans' or whatever thrown into the mix. There's even a sense that Dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him, that it's just what happens in time of war (and, of course, he WAS dropping bombs on people from his plane). Now, through much of these harrowing- and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons, bathrooms and the scraps of food it's always harrowing- luckily Herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well. One of my very favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog breaks away for a moment from Dieter, is when he shows a 'trainee' film used for American soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone...with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife, a flare gun, and a very fast helicopter to come around (and this is put to hilariously dead-pan voice-over work).<br /><br />Yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war-time. Dieter, aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and Herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber, elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes), knows what it is to have to survive at all costs. But yet, as well, as in many of Herzog's protagonist driven films, there's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough, even through horrid moments (the fate of Dunae) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter (is he American, or a spy, they ask on the chopper). Dieter is such a man with a spirit, and he's given via Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, [[well-shot]], albeit maybe too short, tribute to his life. And, of course, it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization Rescue Dawn.","We [[—ïee]] at the beginning of Little Dieter Needs to Fly Dieter Dengler, the subject of the [[filÔΩç]], an [[obsessiv-ecompulsive]].

He's not ever totally 'normal', but unlike a Timothy Treadwell, you wont think ever really about laughing at him either.<br /><br />So, along with his hero (whether of war or not is hard to say, as Dieter disputes that claim as saying the ones who died were the real heroes, typical but perhaps quite true), Herzog stylizes his film with a mix of old stock footage when detailing Dieter's early life (the period footage of [[W]] [[W2]] scenes and post German rubble is always a captivating sight, and with Herzog gets up a notch in his timing and assemblage with music), and in capturing the footage of Vietnam in aerial viewings of jungles and fields. Herzog is also very wise at not injecting politics much at all into the proceedings, there's no 'I was used by the Americans' or whatever thrown into the mix. There's even a sense that Dieter doesn't hold too much of a grudge with everything that happened to him, that it's just what happens in time of war (and, of course, he WAS dropping bombs on people from his plane). Now, through much of these harrowing- and even in the smaller bits involving what went on in prisons, bathrooms and the scraps of food it's always harrowing- luckily Herzog keeps a level of humor in check as well. One of my very favorite scenes in the film, where Herzog breaks away for a moment from Dieter, is when he shows a 'trainee' film used for American soldiers meant to show what should happen in case they get abandoned in the jungle alone...with all of the gear that they could possibly have including a knife, a flare gun, and a very fast helicopter to come around (and this is put to hilariously dead-pan voice-over work).<br /><br />Yet even the moments where one laughs only brings to mind the moments of absurdity in a time of absolute crisis, and how one can't ever really imagine what it's like to be alone in a foreign territory surrounded by people who will do anything to keep said person as a form of collateral in war-time. Dieter, aside from knowing that flying and airplanes are the only way of life he would ever want to have (and Herzog ends the film on a wonderfully somber, elegiac note where he flies over a large field of airplanes), knows what it is to have to survive at all costs. But yet, as well, as in many of Herzog's protagonist driven films, there's the near unalterable spirit that will keep on enduring if one's strong enough, even through horrid moments (the fate of Dunae) and problems all the way up to the rescue by the helicopter (is he American, or a spy, they ask on the chopper). Dieter is such a man with a spirit, and he's given via Herzog a fantastic, tragic, creative, [[w]] [[ell-shot]], albeit maybe too short, tribute to his life. And, of course, it pumps me up even more for the upcoming dramatization Rescue Dawn.",1
"I watched this series after Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave 10/10 grade. I had read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series, or if possible, even better. At this point I must emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching. However, I didn't enjoy it as much as Tipping the Velvet, for the following reasons: <br /><br />1. Less passion, love, and related sexual content. There were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements, which I held integral for a love story. Fingersmith felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet.<br /><br />2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second part, and the ending. The second part should have been the climax of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost totally skipped, perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content. The series should have been in three parts, featuring two cliffhangers, with a lot more focus on the second part.<br /><br />3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how it affected their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic. <br /><br />4. The ending was much more hasty than in Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open.<br /><br />[[Despite]] these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a [[good]] series, and [[well]] worth 7/10.

"When a saboteur [[blows]] up a [[controversial]] government research [[lab]], [[two]] experimental [[animals]] are loosed in a [[small]] [[community]] in [[Washington]] State. One is a [[dog]] with unusual [[intelligence]]. The other is an ""Outside eXperimental COmbat Mammal"", or ""OXCOM"". Because of reasons divulged further into the film, the oxcom hates the dog, and so is trying to kill it. Watchers concerns the accidental involvement of Travis Cornell (Corey Haim), his mom Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracey (Lala Sloatman) with the dog and oxcom, as two National Security Organization agents, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and Cliff (Blu Mankuma), track them down.<br /><br />Many comments are made about Watchers being very different than the Dean Koontz book that serves as the launching pad for the film. This is true. But it should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the film on its own merits, not how closely it matches the book. Bill Freed and Damian Lee, who wrote the screenplay, are just as much artists as Koontz is (that's not a quality comparison, just a statement that they're all artists). So is director Jon Hess. Their job as filmmakers isn't to slavishly follow the book as if it were a script. They're [[adapting]] the book, as [[artists]], to make a [[unique]] [[artwork]]. [[It's]] based on the book. [[Not]] identical to it. You have to [[loosen]] your preconceptions/[[expectations]] when you [[watch]] the film, because you're going to be [[experiencing]] an [[artwork]] that you are not already familiar with, even if you've read Koontz' novel.<br /><br />So, is Watchers a good film? It's pretty good, not [[excellent]]. Good enough to earn a ""B"", or an [[8]]. Hess begins things on the right foot with one of the most [[beautifully]] [[filmed]] explosions I've seen in awhile. Unfortunately, he trips a bit immediately afterward as we listen to some very thick, jargonistic exposition. After that scene Watchers threatens to become a clich√©d 1980s film as we first meet Travis and Tracey.<br /><br />Veering towards clich√© is a tendency continually threatened. But it is only a skew. More often than not, Hess is able to transcend well-trodden territory with a number of interesting twists: Both Travis and Tracey are from single parent homes, with their genders flipped. Both have unique, mature relationships with their parents. Although this is a horror film, a major focus is a cute, intelligent canine, and it often feels as much like an adventure film as it does horror, a thriller, or sci-fi, which are all genres it touches upon. Hess introduces a large cast of characters, some not entering until late in the game, yet the film is never confusing and no characters feel as if they are left in the dust--all of the threads are nicely tied up in the end. The structure is also complex in that there are two major villains, the second becoming less obviously ill-intentioned as the film progresses, until a twist accompanied by brutal violence makes one antagonist clearer. Soon after, Hess gives us a nice moment of doubt with the other antagonist.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in my eyes is a dreaded, common one with horror films since at least the 1980s--the ""attack"" scenes are shot too darkly, too close, too out of focus, and they're edited too choppily. It makes it extremely difficult to tell what's going on, which saps most of the tension from scenes that should be a highlight. Surely, part of Hess' motivation for the style, and this is the typical justification for this problem, was worry that the creature would come across as humorous and/or fake rather than frightening and suspenseful. In my view, presenting the audience with a dizzying blur isn't a satisfactory solution. We only get to see the creature costume/makeup clearly towards the end of the film. It was well done enough that better shot and edited attack scenes would have brought the film up to at least a 9.<br /><br />Regardless of the degree of correspondence between the novel and the film, Watchers presents a gripping story using smart, alluring characters. It is frequently a nail-biter and the horror scenes are more feral than you might expect, if not exactly gory (although there is a fair amount of blood in a couple scenes).

"This [[movie]] was outright [[painful]] for me to watch. I understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. But there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. First off, jump cuts. There are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. There are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. What I mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. Secondly, the dialog. I understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also (example: set a movie in Boston, yet people use west coast slang with a Chicago accent). Even with understanding this, it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present. These are only the two most vivid problems I encountered with this film. There were a few others. I do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. I have years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget indie film) industry.

Compare her to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.

Nearly twenty years later, I'm delighted to report that I've finally got my hands on the [[two-disc]] Shriek Show / Media Blasters special edition, and it's just as [[eerie]] and [[unsettling]] as I remember it, if not more so.<br /><br />The plot, as is usual for genre flicks (and this was Lieberman's first film as a 'director for hire', though he did at least remove all the religious cult snake-handling mumbo-jumbo from the screenplay), is a bit thin - five likable twenty-somethings (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in a pair of uncomfortably tight white strides) venture into the dense Oregon woodlands to do a spot of camping and to check out a patch of land that's been bequeathed to one of their number. But Just Before Dawn stands out from a crowd of imitators because Lieberman wastes no time in showing us just how deranged things are on this particular patch of mountain, with a complete innocent skewered and a drunk preacher's truck shoved down a hill and engulfed in flames within minutes of the film beginning. The youngsters come rolling into the picture in a snappy Winnebago, Blondie's 'Heart of Glass' pounding on the soundtrack, and before you can say ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre!"" they've clobbered an innocent deer with the front bumper and had their first taste of aggro from the heavy-set maniac responsible for the opening catastrophes. Forest ranger Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that things are likely to go awry if they go any further, but they go ahead with the trip anyway, refusing to give the sozzled preacher a ride even though he's understandably scared witless and finally pitching camp miles from anywhere. Needless to say, things go downhill from here.<br /><br />Although this film's not short on bloody horror and well-handled action scenes, the standout moments for me are those where Lieberman lets his camera zoom out, long and slow, from apparently innocuous shots of the fun-loving kids larking around in the wilderness, or just lets it settle for a while on the dense, imposing, people-dwarfing woodlands. He makes the Oregon exteriors as threatening and as ominous as Kubrick made the Overlook Hotel's spacious interiors in the Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (discounting the horribly distorted racket that runs over the titles) stays the right side of intrusive, underscoring the slowly escalating menace with subtlety and flair. There are plenty of surprises along the way, nods to Deliverance with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky, disturbing family, and a truly bizarre kill technique deployed shortly before the film's end. I won't spoil it for you. I've said enough.<br /><br />Quite why this undervalued horror gem fell through the cracks and became a cult item instead of a breakout hit is hard to ascertain, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years to come - it deserves to be.","29 Sept 1990 marked a small but important milestone in my appreciation of [[horrr]] flicks.

"I honestly have to say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most [[fun]] and unintentionally hilarious films I've ever seen. This film is packed with stupid dialog, ridiculous scenes, and a self-involving plot, starring legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself.<br /><br />The threadbare story-line is about an aging director (Fulci, who is also named Lucio Fulci in the film...)who is starting to go nuts and hallucinate because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years. He goes to a shrink who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer, but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing. The rest of the film is made up of shots from the ""film"" that Fulci is directing during all this action, scenes of the shrink killing people all-the-while grinning like a f!cking moron, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well...<br /><br />A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely over-top-and ridiculous in every sense. The gore is classic Fulci - nasty and strong with some really decent scenes. The chainsaw sectioning of a female corpse is pretty cool, as is the chainsaw beheading of a small boy. Lots of stabbings, gougings and other cool kill-scenes make this one a pretty non-stop bloodbath. The ridiculous dialog (LICK IT!!!!LICK IT!!!), as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing slap-fest and the running down of an innocent hippy come easily to mind...) make this one [[fun]] as hell. Not nearly as dark as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is more of a self-indulgent horror/comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny, is actually kind of sad. I say to grab a fifth of cheap bourbon and settle in to this one. I watched CAT with a few friends and we laughed the entire time.

"""Man of the Year"" [[tells]] the [[story]] of Tom [[Dobbs]] (Robin Williams) a political [[comedian]] (like Jon Stewart or Stephen [[Colbert]]) who has his own television show. On his [[show]] he [[talks]] about all sorts of [[things]] but his [[main]] [[focus]] are political issues which he is very opinionated about. One day on his [[show]], a [[fan]] from the audience [[raises]] the [[idea]] that [[Dobbs]] should [[run]] for [[President]] of the [[United]] States. After that episode aired, millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs [[would]] make a [[great]] [[candidate]] for the President for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for President and low and behold wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a [[woman]] by the name of Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position. A [[funny]] [[yet]] [[serious]] political thriller ensues¬Ö <br /><br />Man anyone walking into this film [[expecting]] to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how [[misleading]] their marketing campaigns. ""Man of the Year"" is a [[great]] example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that [[makes]] [[good]] [[arguments]] and [[allows]] its audience to think. I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in-between its comedy routine.<br /><br />But enough about marketing, lets get down to the film itself.<br /><br />I [[really]] [[liked]] ""Man of the [[Year]]"" even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. One of the many things I will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward. I really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it. Some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right.<br /><br />""Man of the Year"" talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn't about candy coating them. I also think the whole political subplot, while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic. Also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed.<br /><br />As far as acting goes, I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but I personally still think he is funny and he's a good serious actor as well. This is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. Also it's nice to see Lewis Black co-star in a decent film. Again I like Black when he appears on ""The Daily Show"" and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful. This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them.<br /><br />""Man of the Year"" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who has brought us such films as ""Rain Man,"" ""Good Morning Vietnam,"" and ""Wag the Dog."" Levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it. Like I said I know a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but I thought it fit in nicely. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a fine job with this film.<br /><br />In the end, don't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you. It does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama. It's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn't a typical Hollywood film. It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn't end the way I thought which made me happy. It's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what's going to happen next.

"A good example of the differences between [[American]] and foreign cinema can be seen in a film I recently watched on television: Indecent Proposal.<br /><br />Indecent Proposal's two protagonists, David and Diane Murphy are played Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore.

This is how to love a woman! Not David's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy pier. (Did I see that right?) As Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a Rich Man, but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it!

Yes Diane, her transformation to Rich Man's fianc√©e now complete, is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol.

The [[two]] things have totally [[different]] [[paces]], [[totally]] different characters, it are just totally [[different]] worlds!

Cut to [[present]] [[day]] Bucharest where [[two]] CIA [[agents]] Ty Griffin (Michael [[Pare]]) & Jennifer [[Wells]] ([[Sandra]] Hess) are about to negotiate the [[safe]] return of the son of a [[rich]] American ambassador from his kidnappers. In pursuit of one of the kidnappers Griffin loses him on the roof of a building but finds a [[large]] pool of blood & no [[visible]] signs of what happened to him.

Griffin & Wells are on the case when they are reported [[missing]] & soon [[realise]] that local [[legends]] of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named [[Father]] [[Soren]] (Fintan McKeown) [[planning]] to [[flood]] the world with them...<[[br]] /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews [[Gargoyles]] is yet [[another]] masterpiece [[Wynorski]] can [[add]] to his credits, not. The script by [[Wynorski]], Ion Ionescu, A.G. [[Lawrence]] & Bill [[Munroe]] is [[crap]], is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. For a start I [[would]] like to know if there was only one [[Gargoyle]] left who laid all those [[eggs]] because I'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why has no one else ever figured it out? Why did the [[priest]] [[want]] to flood the world with them? To rule it? [[The]] Gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? Much like the guys who wrote Gargoyle I don't think he thought it through that well did he? Whichever way I look at it, whichever way I approach it, from whichever angle I try to figure it out from, no matter how many times I try to square the circle Gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. The character's are dull & clich√©d, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. People do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince Griffin that Gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of Aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. The bit on the large Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.<br /><br />Director Wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from Gargoyle is a car chase through Bucharest but it was taken from the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. There isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.<br /><br />Technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the Romanian locations look suitably Romanian. Gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. The acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim Michael Pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.<br /><br />Gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.","[[Gargoy‚Öºe]] [[start—ï]] late one night in '[[RoÔΩçania]] [[1532`]] as a [[peasanùöù]] [[gir‚Öº]] (Daniela [[Na]] [[ne]]) travels along in her [[hor—ïe]] & cart minding her own business when from the [[moonlt]] clouds above a [[li—µing]] Gargoyle swoops down & attacks her, she manages to escape the [[Gargoye]] & [[happen—ï]] upon a castle of some description where an [[ang‚≤Öy]] mob of [[loca‚Öº]] villagers & a Priest are able to put an end to the Gargoyle, or so they think...

[[Meanwhi‚Öºe]] Dr. [[Chrisùöùina]] [[Durat]] ([[Kaùöùe]] Orsini) & her colleague Richard Barrier ([[Ja—ïon]] Rohrer) are renovating a church when the [[churœ≤h]] [[laboure‚≤Ö]] Gregor ([[Mi]] [[hai]] [[Biseric…ënu]]) informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, the [[to]] investigate & find a cave with lots of [[sliy]] cocoons & one very [[ang‚≤Öy]] & very much alive [[Grgoyle]] who [[wates]] no [[t—ñme]] in killing them both. Griffin & Wells are on the case when they are reported [[mis—ïing]] & soon [[reali—ïe]] that local [[legend—ï]] of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named [[Fath–µr]] [[Sore’∏]] (Fintan McKeown) [[p‚Öºanning]] to [[flod]] the world with them...<[[b‚≤Ö]] /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews [[Gragoyles]] is yet [[an–æther]] masterpiece [[Wynors]] [[ki]] can [[ad]] to his credits, not. The script by [[Wynorksi]], Ion Ionescu, A.G. [[Lawre’∏ce]] & Bill [[Muroe]] is [[carp]], is unexciting, dull & is as simplistic as you can get. For a start I [[woul‘Å]] like to know if there was only one [[Garoyle]] left who laid all those [[eg]] [[gs]] because I'm pretty sure it couldn't have made itself pregnant. How did it survive in that hole for 500 years? What did it eat? How did the priest know it was there? Why has no one else ever figured it out? Why did the [[pr—ñest]] [[wnat]] to flood the world with them? To rule it? [[T]] [[he]] Gargoyles are hardly going to take over the world & then let some priest just rule it like a king & if they did what would be left to rule? Much like the guys who wrote Gargoyle I don't think he thought it through that well did he? Whichever way I look at it, whichever way I approach it, from whichever angle I try to figure it out from, no matter how many times I try to square the circle Gargoyles just doesn't make any sense & they story has huge plot holes, lapses in logic & isn't that great to start with anyway. The character's are dull & clich√©d, the action repetitive & unexciting while the film as a whole is a real bore to sit through. People do illogical things & everything that happens is far to convenient like when the priest is try to convince Griffin that Gargoyle's exist & one just suddenly shows up & attacks them. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of Aliens (1986) it's embarrassing & the ending was lame. The bit on the large Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny though when the guy mocked the boys fear of heights & forced him to get on it.<br /><br />Director Wynorski cuts costs & steals footage from other films, in fact the best scene from Gargoyle is a car chase through Bucharest but it was taken from the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, scares or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs in a computer game & has little interaction with any living cast members, there are lots of scenes of people looking up to the sky & trying to appear scarred. There isn't even any worthwhile gore to make the thing watchable, there is one awful decapitation & that's it.<br /><br />Technically the special effects are awful but otherwise it's passable, the Romanian locations look suitably Romanian. Gargoyle went straight-to-video & it shows with a pretty cheap look & feel to it. The acting isn't up to much, personality bypass victim Michael Pare makes for the dullest of dull heroes.<br /><br />Gargoyle is a crap film, it fails at everything a decent creature feature should strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.",0

"Comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. But even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole ""it's funny because it's true"" [[thing]], but I don't, however, see the [[effort]] and often [[times]] I don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(I notice this mostly in the interview segments). The Daily Show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then Jon Stewart came along...and it all went to Hell. Thr first years of Jon Stewart's reign were arguably golden, I though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. The show's humor has gone stale, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about Jon Stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially Evening News but with some gags here and there. For those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, I'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by Democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote Democrat; There, I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. At first, I though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when I actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what I mentioned above), but I'll get to that in a moment. Frist off, the humor in The Daily Show according to Jon Stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either Bush, Cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. Jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. So, unless you ¬´get¬ª the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. Also the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? Well, because Jon said so. Now imagine The Daily Show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the Lewis Black segments). At first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. And the interview have the most odd sense of bias that I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(John Kerry before, Obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as Weekly Standard's own Bill Kristol? He puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for Bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of America, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with Democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. But still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of Jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. That's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. Now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor.

"Although Bullet In The Brain is, without question, superior amongst short films, it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place. There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit. Despite these complaints, there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite [[stupendous]] [[work]] compared to many short, and even full length films.

"<br /><br />Horror movie time, Japanese style. Uzumaki/Spiral was a total freakfest from start to finish. A fun freakfest at that, but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror. The story is difficult to summarize succinctly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts coming face to face w/ extremely disturbing events as the small town she lives in seems to come under the control of spirals. The spirals are everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and everyday objects. The spirals take control of people and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing, people are randomly turning into snails. Why? Who knows or cares, people are turning into snails, that's enough for me. This wasn't as much scary as just creepy as it doesn't have a lot of suspense or jarring attacks as horror films often do. Uzumaki prefers to creep and crawl (like a snail might!) rather than to jolt. A [[favorite]] scene: a woman lies sleeping in a hospital room when this long, thousand legged centipede creature makes its way into the room and slowly up the bed post, across the sheets, over the pillow and into her sleeping ear. I cringed and curled my toes. Uzumaki has a handful of scenes really violent but that are sort of [[humorous]] as well. For example, a man is obsessed w/ spirals, he gets into his washer because he sees a spiral in it when it spins, he commits spiral suicide inside the washer. The last shot we see of him is w/ his body all coiled & rubber like, a human flesh spiral w/ a engorged single eye blinking in the middle of the washer. A bizarre image. Uzumaki has a blatant psychodelic slant to it which [[adds]] to its [[charm]] and [[fun]]. I love horror movies like this. It's not about killing, a la slasher films, it's about a force of evil (the spirals!) taking over you and trying to kill you, force you to kill others. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror film and thank goodness for that","<br /><br />Horror movie time, Japanese style.

"""The [[Desperadoes]]"" (1943) is a genuine [[classic]], not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. This was a [[landmark]] western, the [[biggest]] ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a [[Columbia]] production-a lightweight [[studio]] with a bottom feeding reputation. [[Only]] Fox's ""Jesse James"" (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this [[lavish]] a treatment to the genre. [[Although]] it would be eclipsed in a few years by ""The Searchers"" and ""High Noon"", ""The [[Desperadoes]]"" was a ground [[breaking]] effort and a [[historical]] treasure. <br /><br />In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. <br /><br />Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are [[corrupt]]; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steve's. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn [[Keyes]]). Cheyenne's partner ""Nitro"" [[Rankin]] (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge ([[Raymond]] Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgan's ""Wizard of Oz"" crystal [[ball]] faker). <br /><br />Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a [[spectacular]] barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and [[three-strip]] Technicolor. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. <br /><br />The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /><br />Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in ""Gone With the Wind"" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). <br /><br />The Ford-Keyes dynamic is ""The Desperadoes"" most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the clich√© ""love triangle"" with Scott and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. <br /><br />""The Desperadoes"" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.","""The [[Desperadoe—ï]]"" (1943) is a genuine [[classiœ≤]], not for its story (which is fairly routine), but for its technical production elements. This was a [[landmarùíå]] western, the [[b—ñggest]] ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a [[Colum–¨ia]] production-a lightweight [[stu‘Åio]] with a bottom feeding reputation. [[On‚Öºy]] Fox's ""Jesse James"" (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this [[l…ëvish]] a treatment to the genre. [[Alùöùhough]] it would be eclipsed in a few years by ""The Searchers"" and ""High Noon"", ""The [[Despera]] [[does]]"" was a ground [[breaùíåing]] effort and a [[histor—ñcal]] treasure. <br /><br />In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. <br /><br />Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are [[corrupùöù]]; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steve's. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn [[Ke—Ées]]). Cheyenne's partner ""Nitro"" [[Ranùíåin]] (Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge ([[Raymon‘Å]] Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgan's ""Wizard of Oz"" crystal [[–¨all]] faker). <br /><br />Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed, a [[spectacula‚≤Ö]] barroom brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and [[thee-strip]] Technicolor. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. <br /><br />The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /><br />Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, who would soon be their biggest star. And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in ""Gone With the Wind"" had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). <br /><br />The Ford-Keyes dynamic is ""The Desperadoes"" most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the clich√© ""love triangle"" with Scott and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen), the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses, and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. <br /><br />""The Desperadoes"" is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1
"In [[World]] War II, a badly [[burned]] amnesiac known only as ""The English [[Patient]]"" is [[found]] in the African [[desert]] and is [[transported]] to Italy, where he joins a [[convoy]] of [[medical]] troops and [[others]] at an abandoned monastery. [[Among]] them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a [[Canadian]] [[nurse]] [[whose]] lovers generally [[meet]] unpleasant [[ends]]; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy ([[Kevin]] Whately), [[two]] [[explosives]] [[experts]] who search the [[monastery]] for bombs; and [[David]] Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian [[soldier-of-fortune]] who knows the identity of the [[English]] [[patient]] and has a score to settle.<[[br]] /><br />[[Through]] flashbacks we [[learn]] the [[story]] of the [[Patient]]: he is Laszo Almasy ([[Ralph]] Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the [[late]] '30s, [[falls]] in with a [[group]] of [[British]] cartographers, [[including]] Geoffrey Clifton ([[Colin]] [[Firth]]) and his wife [[Katharine]] (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After [[Clifton]] leaves them on government business, Katharine and [[Clifton]] [[fall]] in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a [[less-than-happy]] [[ending]].<br /><br />If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a [[patient]] found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the [[front]] line of the war in Italy?), then you can [[appreciate]] ""The [[English]] Patient"" as a throwback to the [[intelligent]], [[layered]], sweeping epics of [[David]] Lean in the '[[60s]]. Much more than ""Titanic"" or other epic romances of late, this [[movie]] puts one in [[mind]] of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" - an epic love story set against a huge [[historical]] backdrop. You shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular).<br /><br />The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are fast to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates ""Ownership. Being owned."" The two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey.<br /><br />The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have done without it. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much.<br /><br />Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in Cairo, but it's helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.<br /><br />The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role.<br /><br />""The English Patient"" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, ""The English Patient"" is a wonderful modern-day epic.<br /><br />8/10","In [[Worl‘Å]] War II, a badly [[b’Ωrned]] amnesiac known only as ""The English [[Patienùöù]]"" is [[fond]] in the African [[d–µsert]] and is [[transporte‘Å]] to Italy, where he joins a [[con—µoy]] of [[medica‚Öº]] troops and [[other—ï]] at an abandoned monastery.

"'The Cell' is a [[journey]] into the mind of a serial killer and I mean this [[literally]]. The film is about the journey, about the world it [[shows]] during this journey, the destination does not really [[matter]]. In my opinion this journey through the mind [[gives]] such [[beautiful]] images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty [[good]].<[[br]] /><br />We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.<br /><[[br]] />[[The]] real story then. A serial killer named [[Carl]] (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI [[Agents]] [[Ramsey]] ([[Jake]] Weber) and [[Novak]] (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. [[Another]] girl (Tara [[Subkoff]]) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the [[dumped]] body, Carl can be traced and [[captured]]. Two problems [[occur]]. 1.

In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.<br /><br />Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes [[sure]] Catherine will try to get the location out of [[Carl's]] [[mind]].<br /><br />It is the journey through this sick mind that [[makes]] this film more than [[worth]] [[watching]]. [[Director]] [[Tarsem]] Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes [[back]] to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that.
