"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are [[made]]. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, [[wacky]] moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music throughout but that's part of its charm. It creates its own [[absurd]] universe. If whoever is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases (I believe Columbia released it) takes polls for new releases this gets my vote.","In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected.

"This movie is an [[awesome]] remake of the original by the same title. The movie was cool,despite the fact, I hate new ones! All of the cast was awesome . It has great cast and an awesome plot!! The main plot is a man is poisoned and he has to solve his own murder , neat eh?!Dennis Quaid is the man who is ""D.O.A""(in other words Dead On Arrival).He finds help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect!!Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The movie is quite fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan(City Of Angels,Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern(Home Alone, Very Bad Things,Bushwhacked) in supporting roles in this [[awesome]] ,[[cool]] remake of a classic movie!!","This movie is an [[awful]] remake of the original by the same title.

"One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not [[sure]] why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card. Whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room I was working in, and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the tape.<br /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the far wall was a coat rack. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. Just [[one]] locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said ""I've seen enough."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Nope, [[sorry]]. Next! That's how [[long]] you've got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.<br /><br />[[I]] was reminded of that moment while [[I]] watched the opening of this [[piece]] of [[crap]]. After an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several [[monkeys]] apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is boring! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands.

"It just so happens that IVAN THE [[TERRIBLE]], PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved.

Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no [[surprise]] that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime.

It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor.

"The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the [[latest]] in a [[string]] of [[terribly]] disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face [[despite]] extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally [[rewrite]] such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked [[like]] Smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />The 2002 version must have H.G [[Wells]] turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so [[endearing]]. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie [[dour]]. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, [[Doh]]!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?<br /><br />2. [[Only]] if you saw the [[first]] movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time [[machine]] when you first [[see]] it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.<[[br]] /><br />[[3]]. The director [[goes]] out of his way to [[make]] Pearce's [[character]] [[look]] geeky, a [[worn]] out [[old]] stereotype of scientists. [[In]] the 1960 version [[Rod]] Taylor was a [[little]] nerdy too (at least around Weena) but [[managed]] to be swashbuckling, playful and [[charming]].<br /><br />[[4]]. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- [[abandoned]] in the remake -- is the idea that [[endless]] war [[leads]] to the bifurcation of humanity. [[Blowing]] up the [[Moon]] to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 [[billion]] years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.<br /><br />5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.<br /><br />7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.<br /><br />8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the ""talking rings"" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.<br /><br />Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.","The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the [[late]] in a [[draw]] of [[awful]] disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face [[contempt]] extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination.

The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked [[corresponding]] Smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />The 2002 version must have H.G [[swell]] turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so [[lovely]]. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie [[tenacious]]. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, [[doh]]!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?<br /><br />2. [[simply]] if you saw the [[foremost]] movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time [[auto]] when you first [[regard]] it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.<[[BR]] /><br />[[threesome]]. The director [[break]] out of his way to [[realize]] Pearce's [[quality]] [[expression]] geeky, a [[bear]] out [[previous]] stereotype of scientists. [[inward]] the 1960 version [[gat]] Taylor was a [[slight]] nerdy too (at least around Weena) but [[wield]] to be swashbuckling, playful and [[enamour]].<br /><br />[[IV]]. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- [[deserted]] in the remake -- is the idea that [[dateless]] war [[leave]] to the bifurcation of humanity. [[blowing]] up the [[moonshine]] to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 [[trillion]] years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.<br /><br />5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.<br /><br />7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.<br /><br />8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the ""talking rings"" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.<br /><br />Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.",0

"A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a [[grotesque]] corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />Make-up effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his ""dump in the woods"" scene and current unemployment status.","A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville.

"Sharpe's [[Honour]] for the uninitiated, is the fifth [[entry]] in a [[series]] of [[TV]] movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic [[wars]] and based on the [[books]] by Bernard Cornwell (which [[I]] strongly recommend [[reading]]).

With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the [[slimy]] [[spy]] [[master]] [[spots]] an opportunity to turn the situation [[round]].

Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe [[film]] as [[well]], there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued [[along]] the way, fancy that.<br /><[[br]] />What this results in of [[course]] is a more adventure [[style]] [[approach]].

Furthermore, Ducos [[makes]] a [[fantastic]] [[successor]] to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier.

And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />[[Black]] Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a [[blank]] slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways.

He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club.

"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression.

"[[After]] repeatedly saying how [[brilliant]] so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to [[honour]] an episode with maximum [[points]].

[[Even]] though [[Columbo]] is certain Alex is his [[man]], it actually [[takes]] quite a while and a few false [[leads]] (none of which Columbo really [[swallows]]) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch [[extra]] characters, [[ranging]] from the precocious [[young]] neighbour of Jennifer [[Wells]] and the English mechanic who [[sounds]] [[like]] he would be more at [[home]] on Coronation Street, through to the [[bedraggled]] [[looking]] [[brass]] [[player]] who [[nearly]] [[finds]] himself [[fitted]] up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer [[Wells]], the [[busy]] girl!). And there's [[even]] a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy [[films]].

Blythe is absolutely [[divine]] as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative [[light]], ""Den Brysomme mannen"" [[makes]] normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

"Meh, Sums it all up for me really. Boring story, bland dialogue, dull action scenes (HOW do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring? Do you actually have to TRY to do that?), no real characters etc. Just dull.

"I am a glutton for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. It is cheezy. It is gory. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was either laughing or [[covering]] my eyes in shock. There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work, and some [[cool]] editing tricks.

"This is [[one]] of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places.

[[So]] me & my [[friend]] [[made]] plans to [[see]] it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did.

This leads to the whole opening, which is a [[good]] [[10]] to 15 minutes, and [[involves]] a boat [[chase]], which opens the movie up [[right]]. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli [[turns]] on the [[group]], steals the gold, and kills [[John]] Bridger, who is [[pretty]] much the (retiring) leader of the [[group]]. [[Fast]] foward to a [[year]] [[later]], where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is [[one]] of the [[top]] safe-crackers that anyone can [[ask]] for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's [[death]], as he [[called]] him out of retirement for the [[heist]]) [[says]] that they've [[found]] Steve (who has [[gone]] into [[hiding]]), and [[want]] to [[get]] [[back]] at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets [[back]] together, along with getting the [[help]] of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a [[perfect]] [[mix]] of action with [[funny]] bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who [[goes]] ""[[He]] said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was [[nappy]]. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

"I've been strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's.

What it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and [[extremely]] watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today.

"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /><br />I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her [[appalling]] costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true.

"A [[recent]] re-issue of the French crime [[film]] (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute [[silent]] jewel heist [[sequence]], now [[comes]] in the US in a gorgeous [[new]] print from The [[Criterion]] [[Collection]] with improved subtitles and some [[extras]]. Jules Dassin was an American ([[born]] Julius Dassin in Middletown [[Connecticut]]) who was [[forced]] to make [[films]] in [[Europe]] because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was [[well]] publicized in the US and did [[well]] in art houses. [[Later]] Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) [[starring]] his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again [[glamorized]] and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a [[big]] [[hit]] in Cairo.) The [[new]] Rififi DVD [[includes]] a recent interview with Dassin. I did not previously [[realize]] that [[one]] of the main robbers, Cesar the Milanese, was [[played]] by Dassin, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. He's [[one]] of the most memorable [[characters]], a dandified Italian [[safe]] [[cracker]] who speaks no French.<br /><br />Although this [[classic]] has all the trappings of French film noir--the black and white twilight world of [[well]] lit [[apartments]], shiny black cars, [[men]] in suits, the nightclub [[scenes]], [[including]] a dramatically filmed and [[lit]] title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in [[hand]] or mouth--I don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as Melville's films do. [[But]] there's the [[mesmerizing]] robbery, which [[still]] holds up [[today]] as a [[tour]] de [[force]]. It [[goes]] like clockwork, with a [[fine]] [[sense]] of craft and teamwork among the [[robbers]]. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. Things [[quickly]] [[go]] wrong after they go home and [[distribute]] the [[loot]] when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. [[Has]] there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after? <br /><br />It's the wordless heist [[sequence]] that [[guarantees]] this a [[special]] [[place]], and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic [[career]], deserves full credit for that. [[He]] [[took]] a novel so conventional he was [[going]] to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.","A [[late]] re-issue of the French crime [[flick]] (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute [[unsounded]] jewel heist [[succession]], now [[fare]] in the US in a gorgeous [[raw]] print from The [[standard]] [[appeal]] with improved subtitles and some [[duplicate]].

"The 1973 musical version of [[LOST]] [[HORIZON]] is the most [[wonderful]] [[endearing]] and campy musical [[films]] of [[ALL]] [[TIME]]. The 1973 [[musical]] remake of the [[James]] Hilton [[novel]] about [[mythical]] SHANGRI-LA! is a [[real]] [[special]] [[gem]]. Music by BURT BACHARACH and [[lyrics]] by HAL David. [[A]] strange [[mixture]] of [[straight]] drama, [[adventure]] and [[musical]] sequences. It has the distinction of being the [[ONLY]] anti [[war]] musical [[fantasy]] [[ever]] filmed. <[[br]] /><[[br]] />This [[film]] was a [[critical]] and financial disappointment in the [[United]] [[States]], but [[made]] a [[lot]] of money [[overseas]]. Only in [[America]] did it [[fail]]. [[Highly]] [[different]] and [[unique]] in it's approach as a [[film]] musical, it deserves far [[better]] credit than it's [[given]]. As a [[story]], [[LOST]] HORIZON is an [[incredible]] [[adventure]] and both the 1937 [[Frank]] Capra [[film]] and this 1973 musical are [[faithful]] [[adaptations]] of the James Hilton [[novel]]. What [[I]] [[like]] about the 1973 version is the [[freedom]] in which the musical [[numbers]] are [[presented]]. The [[film]] has a prestigious [[cast]] and a [[gifted]] [[director]] and cinematographer. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a [[wonderful]] place. [[Songs]] [[like]] THE [[WORLD]] [[IS]] A [[CIRCLE]], SHARE THE [[JOY]] and [[LIVING]] TOGETHER, [[GROWING]] TOGETHER [[evoke]] a happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a slightly goofy place? The two [[love]] songs, [[I]] [[MIGHT]] [[FRIGHTEN]] HER [[AWAY]] and the deleted [[I]] [[COME]] TO YOU are the [[sensitive]] spots in the [[picture]]. There's a peacefulness and [[soft]] spoken [[quality]] in both these songs that is very much [[keeping]] with the philosophy of the [[story]]. Moreover, THE [[THINGS]] [[I]] [[WILL]] NOT MISS is a [[good]] [[duet]] with a [[strong]] melody. It's a [[nice]] [[exchange]] of different types of perspective and who can [[fault]] with Olivia Hussey and [[Sally]] Kellerman stomping, [[singing]] and dancing on [[tables]]? They're a [[wonderful]] team and the [[number]] is [[well]] staged. <br /><br />[[I]] [[always]] [[found]] it [[interesting]] in this [[story]] how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to [[take]] his [[place]] in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but [[somewhat]] radical in his [[view]] of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the [[world]] [[outside]] of Shangri-La. If this [[film]] were to be remade today, it would be interesting to [[see]] more [[emphasis]] [[put]] on the [[leading]] [[character]], RICHARD ONWAY'S [[conflict]] with what he [[left]] [[behind]] in the [[outside]] [[world]] as [[opposed]] to what he's found in Shangri-La.<br /><br />Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /><br />LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. A lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.","The 1973 musical version of [[missed]] [[skyline]] is the most [[howling]] [[endear]] and campy musical [[movie]] of [[totally]] [[sentence]].

"The Jazz [[Singer]] is one of a [[number]] of films [[made]] in the [[late]] 1940's and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the [[United]] [[States]].

"Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the [[film]] [[fails]] miserably.<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical [[archetypes]] of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who are, at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, quite complex.<br /><br />Technically the film has a lot of problems however. The cinematography, which is typically regarded highly, I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized, utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also greatly over used.<br /><br />The plot was poorly [[planned]] and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.","Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing.

When I saw this movie i expected it to be a cheesy American [[movie]] done on the cheap with appalling actors. I was really surprised to find that i was totally wrong.

"It's now 2005 and [[15]]+ [[years]] since this cartoon [[first]] aired. I haven't actually [[watched]] it seriously or closely in about 10 [[years]]. [[Now]] that I'm an [[adult]] in my 30s I can [[look]] [[back]] with a [[serious]] eye as [[I]] [[watch]] the episodes again.<[[br]] /><br />[[In]] concept, the [[cartoon]] is partly an homage to the [[classic]] Looney [[Tunes]] but also its own [[original]] show. There are a few episodes that are structured like the [[old]] cartoons. For [[example]], there is a [[singer]] that [[attacks]] [[Buster]] and so he exacts [[revenge]] on this singer's concert -[[exactly]] [[like]] the [[old]] Bugs Bunny [[cartoon]]. The ensuing cartoon is [[similar]] to [[Looney]] [[Tunes]], just in a [[different]] era. If you look at the [[old]] [[Looney]] Tunes, they did an [[awful]] [[lot]] of [[stuff]] exactly [[like]] Tiny [[Toons]] did. The [[old]] [[Looney]] [[Tunes]] [[made]] a [[lot]] of [[social]] commentary and parody. [[There]] were celebrity impersonations. There were a [[lot]] of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. The comedy was surreal and [[wacky]]. You can [[say]] this exactly for Tiny [[Toons]] as [[well]]. The comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most [[definitely]] a throwback to the classics which hadn't been [[done]] [[well]] (if at all) in [[cartoons]] in the decades [[prior]] to this [[show]]. We [[recognize]] the cultural [[references]] in [[Tiny]] [[Toons]] and we can [[roll]] our eyes when something we don't [[like]] [[comes]] up. But the reason we don't think [[Looney]] Tunes are corny is because we weren't [[alive]] [[back]] in the [[40s]]. Also, Looney Tunes was [[original]] [[back]] in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. [[So]] it's [[easy]] to perceive [[Tiny]] Toons in an unfair [[light]] due to our exposure to current [[events]] and our overexposure to [[cartoons]] in general.<br /><br />There [[certainly]] are [[differences]] in many [[respects]] - the timing, the delivery, and [[obviously]] the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different [[periods]], being done under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being [[made]] for kids watching TV. [[Even]] so, they did a [[good]] job making an [[original]] [[show]] with [[original]] gags AND still [[paying]] [[homage]] to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the [[old]] [[Looney]] [[Tunes]].<[[br]] /><br />Since Tiny Toons had a [[lot]] more [[time]] to [[play]] with, they had some [[genuine]] [[moments]] of [[great]] animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.","It's now 2005 and [[XV]]+ [[class]] since this cartoon [[offset]] aired.

"This is a [[good]] episode, but it's not my favorite. [[A]] lot of people love it and on a creative [[level]] it's brilliant. [[Most]] of the episode has no [[dialog]], which is such a cool idea and ""[[Hush]]"" handles the [[silence]] [[really]] [[well]]. Plus, this episode [[introduces]] Tara, who [[I]] like a [[lot]]. [[But]], I don't like Riely or the Initative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to [[get]] a [[lot]] of screen [[time]] in ""[[Hush]].""

[[I]] [[know]] that I'm in the minority, but [[I]] tend to fast-forward [[parts]] of ""[[Hush]]."" Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are [[great]], so if you're [[watching]] on DVD, I recommend [[seeing]] this episode. It [[really]] is a [[classic]].<br /><br />""Hush"" revolves around the entire town losing their voices. Skelatal looking demon-guys [[called]] the Gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human [[scream]] they [[die]]. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies [[try]] to figure out what's [[going]] on, while the Initative also [[start]] investigating. Meanwhile, Xander [[comes]] to [[realize]] how much Anya [[means]] to him and Willow [[meets]] a fellow witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally [[come]] [[face]] to face while fighting the [[Gentlemen]]. They are both stunned about what they learn... He's a commando and she's the Slayer. In the end Buffy saves the day, but she now has to [[deal]] with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life.<br /><br />[[Really]], the creativity of ""Hush"" can't be seen in a basic [[outline]] of its plot. It's the overwhelming [[silence]] of the episode, that [[makes]] it so [[great]]. The characters [[try]] to [[communicate]] in different ways, (White-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger [[gestures]], etc...) and it all just works [[really]] [[well]]. After a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so [[good]] at expressing themselves. During the ""[[talking]]"" [[parts]] of the [[episode]], there are a [[lot]] of [[references]] to the importance of [[really]] ""[[hearing]]"" each other. Anya claims that Xander won't really [[talk]] to her. Giles [[ignores]] Spike and Xander's [[protests]] and [[insists]] that [[Spike]] move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly substitutes the word ""petroleum"" for ""patrolling"" when she talks to Riely so she won't have to explain her calling. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all pretty cool.<br /><br />There are a lot of good parts to this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the Initatives' elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. Also I like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out.<br /><br />On the downside, I don't understand how the Gentlemen are choosing their victims. They just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I've never liked him, but from ""Hush"" on I'm pretty much just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Giles' ""Who are the Gentlemen?"" lecture to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious.

"Like [[almost]] everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles.

[[Yet]] looking at the well choreographed and [[well]] [[polished]] dance routines the girls do every night at Mawby's, you would [[think]] they were working at the [[best]] casino on the Las Vegas [[Strip]].<br /><br />Alex ends up having a predictable [[romance]] with her [[boss]], Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice her [[age]]. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a [[good]] idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which [[makes]] no sense [[given]] how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.<br /><br />When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily [[tells]] Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just [[one]] scene that leaves you wondering what the [[hell]] the makers were thinking when they were making this.<br /><br />Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.

"First of all, the entire script is mostly improv, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are watching is an actual documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot. (We hear him screaming ""Cut!

Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins were purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are actual hippies, the government officials (though not necessarily in the government themselves) are at least actually hearty conservatives within the system, and several of the cops are actual policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms alloted by Watkins, eventually come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a cast member had actually been shot.

"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that [[make]] a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 [[points]].<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is [[one]] of Connery's best, and most [[relaxed]], turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence.

"Yeah, a [[long]] time ago it [[turned]] into a tourist [[attraction]]. [[Now]] it's a prison again. [[Kind]] of. [[Well]], it's more [[like]] an airport [[mixed]] together with a [[junior]] high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so [[I]] guess in that [[way]] it's like a prison. Not [[really]] though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a [[different]] [[line]] so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />[[Let]] me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been [[shot]] about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. [[In]] prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the [[greatest]] celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between [[50]] Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I [[saw]] Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, getting [[back]] to the [[plot]]. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be [[sentenced]] to prison so he can [[get]] [[behind]] the criminal organization. He's [[sentenced]] to [[five]] years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. [[Nothing]] else in the [[movie]] [[matters]] after that, it [[becomes]] a [[meaningless]] [[string]] of action sequences, most of which aren't [[even]] well choreographed.<br /><br />Oh, how about this, a [[helicopter]] [[crashes]] through the roof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one [[point]], accidentally [[freeing]] all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<br /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.","Yeah, a [[tenacious]] time ago it [[become]] into a tourist [[draw]].

"Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures battling Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format. First we have Showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where Simon Bar Sinister works. He fights back when Sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding Sinister. On the street Shoeshine runs afoul of Riff Raff, another dog and gets picked up by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will once again battle Sinister.<br /><br />Once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. For me the film half [[works]] and half doesn't. The part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see Shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. Some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. Its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. Its painfully dull and feels like it takes [[forever]] to get through it, which considering the film is [[say]] 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.<br /><br />The parts that are [[good]] are anything with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is a blast) and anything where Underdog goes into action. Some how somewhere they [[managed]] to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. Of course I could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but I think not, since I do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.<br /><br />[[As]] a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an [[okay]] cartoon to film adaption.

"I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film. <br /><br />Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroic<br /><br />style. Not due to the high level starring which remind me that most<br /><br />of those high starring French films are usually pathetic.

The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly.

"[[I]] liked all the Lilo and Stitch movies. The [[TV]] series weren't that great, but [[I]] [[put]] my opinions of the series [[aside]] when I [[watched]] this movie. And [[I]] must [[say]]... It was [[bad]].<br /><[[br]] />[[One]] thing [[I]] [[found]] disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard it. The [[animation]]. [[I]] found its [[quality]] greatly [[degraded]] since the first movie. Its quality was only as [[high]] as the TV series', something which [[I]] did not expect at all. If you're looking for [[eye]] candy, don't [[expect]] anything much here. Also, the animation [[failed]] to portray any [[serious]] moods. [[Even]] in the [[supposed]] sad [[scenes]], I didn't feel anything for the [[character]], another downgrade from the first movie.<br /><br />The next, was the absolutely horrible voice [[acting]]. [[I]] [[found]] it very, very unconvincing, and [[wondered]] why, Disney, with all its riches and [[glory]], couldn't afford [[voice]] actors with [[real]] talent. The [[voice]] actors' [[skill]] were just as [[annoying]] as the [[one]] in the series. [[I]] tolerated the one in the series because, hey, who wouldn't be [[tired]] out when [[made]] to [[voice]] [[act]] for so many [[episodes]]? Heck, [[I]] don't [[even]] [[know]] how many [[episodes]] there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I just can't [[believe]] that). [[However]], [[I]] thought that the [[voice]] [[acting]] would [[improve]] in the movie, and [[I]] was put down in the [[face]] by the [[truth]], that what they could do in the series was already their [[best]].<br /><br />Next, was the horrible [[script]]. It was [[cheesy]] beyond redemption, and the writers just [[try]] too [[hard]]. They [[try]] to [[put]] some [[jokes]] in, but [[I]] just [[found]] them [[annoying]]. [[Maybe]] it wasn't the voice [[acting]], but the [[cheesy]] [[dialogues]] that [[ruined]] the [[sound]] section. (On the upside, the soundtrack wasn't too bad, and matched the mood quite [[well]].) <br /><[[br]] />Fourthly was the problem with the storyline. [[I]] [[predicted]] everything, and the storyline was what [[made]] the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden. You have the [[aliens]] get new [[positions]] and responsibilities inouter space. After the initial [[hype]], they [[realize]] that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life. <br /><br />Meanwhile, the evil villain [[gets]] broken out of jail after a very 'action packed' action scene and breaks in to Jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. The experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their life. Seriously, how many other movies has used that ending already? The that storyline was extremely short and formulaic, so don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />So Disney has failed in sound, graphics and storyline. The only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they managed to retain the 'feel' of the characters, but even that wasn't able to save the movie.

Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean come on... ICARLY... pretty self centered eh? Freddy isn't bad, I don't have a comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast, they go shouting out all their lines.It's sorta bad influence in a way because Carly has a web show and if kids will copy this, they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe.<br /><br />The only nice things is that it has SOME funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining.

Miranda Cosgrove is the main character but is not such a good actress quite frankly. Spencer, her brother is a way much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he probably is the only one that knows how to act. Carly on the other hand tries to act her heart out but... sorry, it just isn't good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean come on... ICARLY... pretty self centered eh? Freddy isn't bad, I don't have a comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitude whenever they go to film a web cast, they go shouting out all their lines.It's sorta bad influence in a way because Carly has a web show and if kids will copy this, they might be giving their own information and that not pretty safe.<br /><br />The only nice things is that it has SOME funny parts of the show which makes it entertaining.

"That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his [[best]] ever.

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A [[big]] part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him [[fine]] in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a [[big]] part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police [[finding]] Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was [[okay]] although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been [[nice]] to [[see]] her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to [[make]] movies, I [[know]] they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.","When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited.

"(Very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) <br /><br />IF you go into this movie with sufficiently [[low]] expectations.

Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.<br /><br />I will say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing; The D's humor simply couldn't work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But unless you're a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. ""Pick"" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? I don't think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate.

"Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot, sunny day, I might add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is.<br /><br />Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite. All that watching Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past, for nothing?. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, however crazy/stupid you might think it. If you don't watch a lot of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat, but [[I]] found this slow, [[boring]] and highly [[derivative]]. If you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it, if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter.","Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy.

"With [[Nurse]] Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the [[Company]] of [[Men]], Your [[Friends]] & Neighbors) [[makes]] his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as [[opposed]] to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and [[yet]] remains [[true]] to his [[roots]]. While his [[cast]] is now [[composed]] of A-list Hollywood [[names]] (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris [[Rock]]), his material [[remains]] just as [[bizarre]] and quirky as his [[first]] two features, [[proving]] that he just may be the [[next]] big [[thing]]. [[Nurse]] Betty is [[one]] of the [[darkest]] [[comedies]] to be [[advertised]] towards a mainstream audience in years, and [[considering]] its moderate box office and [[critical]] success, [[perhaps]] moviegoers weren't as [[dumb]] and brainwashed as we though they were. The [[story]] [[follows]] (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless [[marriage]] to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's [[sent]] into [[shock]] and obliviously [[sets]] out for Hollywood to [[meet]] her [[object]] of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. When Freeman and Rock [[discover]] that the car she took [[contains]] [[10]] kilos of cocaine, they [[hit]] the road as [[well]] and outrageousness [[ensues]]. Fans of LaBute's previous work might have a [[hard]] [[time]] [[figuring]] out how this could [[possibly]] be the same [[guy]] who [[directed]] [[In]] the [[Company]] of [[Men]] -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist [[pigs]] who [[play]] a [[practical]] [[joke]] on a deaf [[co-worker]] --, but when you [[think]] about it, the connection is rather [[clear]]: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly [[taken]] advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the [[man]] she's chasing thinks her genuine [[adoration]] is [[nothing]] more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- [[considering]] that his recurring theme involves the [[downfall]] of innocent [[women]]. But personally, [[I]] [[think]] he's [[coming]] to the defense of the fair sex and [[dealing]] far more harshly with the abusers in his [[pictures]] than the [[abused]]. One of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.<br /><br />Grade: A-","With [[suck]] Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the [[company]] of [[men]], Your [[Quaker]] & Neighbors) [[hold]] his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as [[fight]] to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and [[notwithstanding]] remains [[rightful]] to his [[settle]].

"There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene's. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course those were made with a bit of budget. All shown on 42nd in NY, but hey, there were other grindhouses out there that showed no budget roughies. Wet Wilderness is an example of it. It circuited the underground scene after a while so copies were available but as seen on other reviews, some copies were abrupt cut at the end. But the version I watched was complete. Well i would call this one more a porn one then a roughie, there is a serial killer around but he likes more to watch others have sex instead of killing them, when he kills it's done off screen. The acting is the [[worst]] I ever seen. And I guessed that the so called actors didn't like what they are doing, for example in the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watch one girl stop performing and pulls a pubic hair out of here mouth then continues doing what was happening, or when mother is riding the black man, the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by ants! But it is the storyline that made this one famous, incest and racism is what this made it famous. When there is blood watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act, god this is worse but still one to have if you are into sleaze and grindhouse.

"I would not deny that I have quite enjoyed watching any Japanese horror films, but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The film follows the story of the Grudge.

"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, ""Look at me, I am so pretty!"" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much [[acting]] in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The [[original]] version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much [[better]] actors. The original version of this movie [[made]] the PAST seem like the [[real]] [[base]] of the characters. This new version [[lacks]] [[substance]] and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then [[fails]] to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very [[well]] [[explained]], and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher [[shop]] filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also [[silly]] is the giant [[pit]] full of water and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter.

"""Campfire Tales"" is basically [[made]] up of [[three]] spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert.

They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a [[little]] abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who [[takes]] refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each [[story]] becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that [[awaits]] them is [[yet]] to [[come]]...<br /><br />In my opinion, the last story they [[tell]] is [[probably]] the [[scariest]] and had some genuine, [[frightening]] effects. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it's unoriginal plot was it's [[downfall]]. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like eight [[years]] old on HBO and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it's not scary to me now. You'll probably recognize some of the cast here, particularly Amy Smart from the opening ""hook"" interlude story, and Christine Taylor as one of the main actresses in the film.

Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock.

Benes' every gesture is [[benevolent]], even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing.

But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous.

"""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"".

Still, if you've read Gone With The Wind, you would see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /><br />Quite frankly, it seemed to me like there was way too much going on without Rhett.

Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a [[disappointing]] only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far.

According to the opening [[credits]] Jacqueline Hyde was 'inspired' by the [[classic]] Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The Strange [[Case]] of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', [[frankly]] if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his [[story]] here he'd [[turn]] in his [[grave]]. For a [[start]] I [[think]] Jacqueline Hyde was/is [[intended]] to be a horror film, the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how [[bad]] it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core [[porno]] than anything else & [[extremely]] [[tame]] with it, why [[sit]] down & [[watch]] this [[softer]] than [[soft]] porno crap when you can [[watch]] you proper hard-core [[stuff]] that actually [[delivers]] the goods? Why, that's the [[question]] [[I]] [[ask]] here. It's not [[even]] [[good]] [[porn]] either, [[besides]] being [[far]] too [[soft]] it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex [[scenes]] are few & far between. The most [[intelligent]] aspect of this [[film]] is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the [[last]] century & judging by the IMDb's plot [[summary]] it sounds a [[hell]] of a [[lot]] [[better]] than this [[piece]] of [[rubbish]]. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how [[bad]] it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of.

I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core [[erotica]] than anything else & [[super]] [[moderate]] with it, why [[seat]] down & [[determine]] this [[piano]] than [[subdued]] porno crap when you can [[ticker]] you proper hard-core [[gorge]] that actually [[save]] the goods? Why, that's the [[head]] [[i]] [[demand]] here. It's not [[yet]] [[commodity]] [[pornography]] either, [[likewise]] being [[ALIR]] too [[voiced]] it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex [[fit]] are few & far between. The most [[healthy]] aspect of this [[flick]] is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the [[finis]] century & judging by the IMDb's plot [[compact]] it sounds a [[blaze]] of a [[Lot]] [[ameliorate]] than this [[assemble]] of [[applesauce]]. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how [[badly]] it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.",0
"Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister. At death's door, she requests, ""Send for David Holm!"" But, Victor Sjöström (as David Holm) cannot be located, because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard, with his drinking buddies. Dying Sister Astrid Holm (as Edit) wants to see if praying for Mr. Sjöström's soul, over the past year, has produced any results; arguably, it has not. In the graveyard, Sjöström tells the story of ""The Phantom Carriage"", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg (as Georges). According to legend, the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people, until being relieved next New Year's Eve...<br /><br />Director Sjöström, whose lead performance is very strong, combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film. The great ""double exposure"" effect is used frequently, but never seems overdone; and, it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any [[less]] memorable (for example, Sjöström's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door). A Selma Lagerlöf story probably wasn't one you could, or would want to, tamper with in the 1920s - which may, or may not be, why the ending of this film is a letdown. And, unlike similar spiritual stories, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief, if you think too carefully about what is really happening in ""Körkarlen"".<br /><br />******* Körkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Sjöström ~ Victor Sjöström, Hilda Borgström, Tore Svennberg","Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister.

"BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a [[bad]] day, she'd pull off a [[better]] performance than anyone [[involved]] in the [[travesty]] known as THE [[HAUNT]].<br /><br />With regard to my heading, this movie is not [[painful]] to [[watch]] because the [[content]] is disturbing. It is [[painful]] to [[watch]] because it is just downright [[boring]].<br /><br />Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The [[first]] possibility - these authors were [[involved]] in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors whilst not directly [[involved]] were paid to write [[positive]] [[reviews]] after production was completed. The final possibility - none of these authors has [[seen]] a sufficient [[number]] of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.<br /><br />The [[setting]] for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a [[visit]] from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.<br /><br />On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.<br /><br />Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some!<br /><br />First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.<br /><br />Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!<br /><br />The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.<br /><br />Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.","BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events.

"Not being a particular fan of westerns, I watched this primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Lucy Show"" type of role. Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a saloon in the Arizona Territory in 1868 who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger.) Ball's performance was OK - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (A typical funny line - ""there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!"") I didn't [[find]] the [[story]] all that [[compelling]], although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent. There's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. As to Christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there.

"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.<br /><br />I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.<br /><br />Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as [[funny]] as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />Characters are similarly hammered [[home]], particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. Don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on IMDb, check it out for yourself.","Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic.

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are [[lousy]] dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final film is a letdown.","Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.

The only good part of this movie was the ending. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. No no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended. As long as the cast was [[dancing]] and not talking the movie went along well. As for Chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth. As for going to see the movie wait for the rental or TV. Do not make the same mistake I did and pay 8.50,The only good part of this movie was the ending.

"This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. After that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this.

"When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations.

The music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. The storyline is also pretty [[weak]], as its more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. But dont misunderstand, it's not very good Schooby-Doo episodes.

If you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn't know. It might have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast TV.","When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations.

The following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.<br /><br />When the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked Atlantis: Milo's Return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations I had. The music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. The storyline is also pretty [[washy]], as its more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. But dont misunderstand, it's not very good Schooby-Doo episodes. I didnt laugh a single time, although I might have sniggered once or twice.<br /><br />To the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. If you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn't know. It might have been better if Milo's Return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast TV.",0

"I wasn't [[impressed]] with the Graffiti Artist, despite it's artsy (aka. low budget improvisation) appeal.

Glen or Glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable Wood schlock-actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller, and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one.

But then, we get this very [[eccentric]] montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid Puppetmaster.

Hmmm, must be that alien/cross-dressing/habidashery cowspiracy-thang!! Glen or Glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable Wood schlock-actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller, and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one.

"I gave ""Airport '79"" only two stars because it's a [[truly]] [[lousy]] film. Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) This is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />A'79 really does seem like an early version of ""Airplane!"" Every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's truly funny.<br /><br />And I'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />In [[summary]], a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit [[amusing]].

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no [[style]] whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], [[starting]] with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the [[dying]] octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure [[painter]] of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by [[Crisp]]; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is [[given]] no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never [[get]] the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no [[sense]] of the period. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance.

The interest for humans, for people and their reasons and actions never [[stammer]].<br /><br />A due word about Peck himself; he performs with brio, and though I usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring, in such small outings I find intact all Peck's somber and even chilling glamor.

And then we have Langley Kirkwood as [[count]] Orlock, [[one]] of the most [[pathetic]] and [[laughable]] Dracula's [[ever]] to (dis)[[grace]] the [[silver]] [[screen]]. [[Just]] look at his [[outfit]]. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic [[black]] suit or something, he's [[wearing]] a [[cheap]] old-school Halloween-suit with [[fringes]]. You [[thought]] Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times.

And then we have Langley Kirkwood as [[counting]] Orlock, [[unitary]] of the most [[silly]] and [[mirthful]] Dracula's [[always]] to (dis)[[thanksgiving]] the [[fluent]] [[sort]]. [[precisely]] look at his [[fit]]. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic [[bleak]] suit or something, he's [[wear]] a [[punk]] old-school Halloween-suit with [[outskirt]]. You [[cogitate]] Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.",0

"OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason.

Where's originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the first time? Why remake such a movie to begin with?

It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. <br /><br />This film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors.

Viggo Mortensen's accent was [[annoying]] and Rita Wilson was far too [[old]] to [[play]] Caroline. Her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun [[like]] Patricia Hitchcock's performance. <br /><br />The only [[good]] thing I saw about the film was that Gus Van Sant was able to [[open]] the movie with the shot [[Hitch]] had envisioned.

"Go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by Robert Wise, with second-unit direction by Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, was designed by Ken Adam and scored by Max Steiner, starred Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot, was filmed in colour, scope and stereo, at Cinecitta in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they'll tell you to go away and stop being silly.<br /><br />They'll tell you that no such film EXISTS. That the names you've quoted NEVER worked together - they weren't even contemporaneous. And that you've just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to [[befuddle]] them.<br /><br />At which point you can direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of ""Helen Of Troy"". They'll be amazed! This lesser-known sword-and-sandal epic has ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews.<br /><br />And it is certainly an [[oddity]]. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema. The orgy scenes were shot twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version Britain and America got). I believe even La Sophia is an extra in this [[one]].<br /><br />Either way, the names STAGGER the mind. But it's really just a coincidence.

That the names you've quoted NEVER worked together - they weren't even contemporaneous. And that you've just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to [[confuse]] them.<br /><br />At which point you can direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of ""Helen Of Troy"". They'll be amazed! This lesser-known sword-and-sandal epic has ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews.<br /><br />And it is certainly an [[curiosity]]. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema. The orgy scenes were shot twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version Britain and America got).

"In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films.

"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a [[senseless]] mess. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber.

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routine]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack.

"After traveling around the world, it dawned on me that Australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history.<br /><br />Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia wasn't establish following a war, it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather..... boring! Nothing ""big"" happened to mark some sort of turning point in Australia's history.... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-general of Australia - [[John]] Kerr.<br /><br />For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonised by the British. As time went on, it became apparent that Australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly from the British; rather, Australia would be run by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the British system. This [[shift]] was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes Australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two ""pro-crown"" sections that were included and remain there to this day. These are more or less regarded as the ""reserve powers of the Crown (king/queen of [[Great]] Britain)."" The first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the Governor-general. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the Queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the ""Executive"" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the Governor-general. As such, the Govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by Australian parliament if he thinks fit. For instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By ""convention"" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to sign it, he will, almost always without question. In fact, by ""convention"" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the Governor-general's ""pleasure."" Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or Prime Minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film ""the dismissal."") Whether 'at the Governor-General's pleasure' can be construed as ""the unfettered right to dismiss"" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia.<br /><br />Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. It didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the Governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />In terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. The film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. There were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Further, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. Moreover, any that we're raised, for example Connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. The film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. This was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.<br /><br />The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in its short life.

"I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series.

It ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more. Quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show that is not the case, it ended the way it was actually planned to end, it is just a lousy [[ending]].","I remember when this show came out.

"[[Having]] [[enjoyed]] Neil Gaiman's [[writing]] (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The [[Dream]] [[Hunters]]"") in the past, [[I]] [[figured]] Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed.

"""Stripperella"" is an [[animated]] series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The [[Tender]] Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them [[fat]] and Cheapo, a [[criminal]] who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen [[share]] a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />[[Back]] in [[late]] June of 2003, [[Spike]] TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three [[animated]] [[shows]]. Those [[shows]] were ""Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little [[let]] down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an awesome intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[funny]] as hell! The show was just so [[silly]], I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy. Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD.

Alan Cummings was, well, Alan Cummings-as-villain, which we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. <br /><br />The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute-as-a-button, as you'd expect, and Jamie Kennedy stunk, as you'd expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and in Three Kings. He should stick, perhaps, to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he ain't.<br /><br />The writing and direction were, if anything, [[forged]] than Kennedy's performance. I semi-remember one clever (though seven-year-old clever) line that I wish someone would quote accurately for the ""Memorable Quotes"" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume being the ""crappiest crap in Craptown,"" it was a second-grade joke, but sort of funny in context.<br /><br />Over all, since there's nothing lower than a ""one,"" I give this film a ""one.""",0

"1959 was a [[landmark]] in the [[world]] of [[film]]. Several [[great]] directors of the [[classic]] [[era]] were [[releasing]] [[career]] capping [[classics]] that [[ranked]] among their [[best]].

[[In]] certain ways, though, they couldn't be [[farther]] apart. Godard was [[still]] a believer in the [[director]] as arbiter of [[style]].

"Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in the 70s, this is the stagiest of all.

The thing looks [[like]] a very, very [[big]] budget [[school]] [[play]], or indeed, a very very [[low]] budget [[action]] movie, which it actually is. It's been [[said]] on many occasions that this was the [[last]] of the genre entries, and [[I]] do hope it was. The genre didn't [[die]] peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of [[smoke]], [[fake]] [[blood]] and lousy [[sound]] [[effects]]. [[Peter]] Cushing must have [[felt]] a boy again, as a [[nutty]] professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to accept a part in this [[mishmash]] and carry it so bravely.<br /><br />Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed, there is a great [[deal]] of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) [[draws]] towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe [[loses]] her underworldly accent.<br /><br />The triple bill, currently on the market, features this film [[plus]] two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War [[Lords]] Of Atlantis.

"I had always eyed Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of Lamberto Bava's terrible DEMONS (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but I decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full Halloween swing. I checked out the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD prior to viewing the main feature  the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but, then, the film proper (which makes no more sense than what's presented in that frenzied two-minute montage and, in retrospect, can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights) proved a definite let-down!<br /><br />Opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative.

"[[I]] was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not [[born]] in the 80's. I was [[born]] on may [[14th]] 1994. [[Despite]] this, my life was very much in the [[style]] of the 80's. When other [[kids]] had playstations, [[I]] was [[playing]] Zelda on my NES etc. [[Now]], this [[movie]] [[holds]] a [[special]] [[place]] in my [[heart]] already despite me being only 15 [[years]] [[old]] at the [[time]] of [[writing]] this [[review]]. [[I]], because of my 80's [[style]] early Childhood, [[watched]] many [[TV]] [[shows]] and [[saw]] Many [[movies]] that other [[kids]] didn't [[see]], and this [[movie]] was [[one]] of those, and [[one]] of the greatest too.<br /><[[br]] />It [[starts]] off in the Los Angeles [[home]] of Alvin Seville, Simon [[Seville]], Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the Chipmunk's [[adoptive]] [[father]], is in a [[rush]] to [[get]] to the [[airport]] as he is [[going]] on a [[business]] [[trip]] [[around]] Europe. His taxi is [[almost]] there and The Chipmunks [[help]] him pack. While they are [[talking]], Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to [[see]] the [[world]] ([[Even]] though, technically Dave is only going to [[Europe]], so to Alvin, [[apparently]] only America and Europe [[qualify]] as ''The World''). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of [[Miss]] Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. [[Soon]] Dave is off to the [[airport]] and the Chipmunks are left at home with [[Miss]] Miller. [[Later]], at a local Café the [[Chipmunks]] are playing a game of ''[[Around]] the [[World]] in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After [[losing]] the [[game]] to Brittany after having his [[Hot]] [[air]] Balloon [[eaten]] out of the [[sky]] by a crocodile, Alvin get's in an [[argument]] with Brittany about who would [[really]] [[win]] a [[race]] [[around]] the [[world]]. [[Two]] [[diamond]] [[smugglers]] [[sitting]] at a nearby [[table]], Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of [[transporting]] their [[diamonds]] over the [[world]], [[decide]] to fool the children into delivering them for them. They [[set]] up a race [[around]] the [[world]], where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop [[offs]] [[around]] the [[world]] and receive a [[doll]] in the opposing team's likeness (secretely [[filled]] with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. The [[winning]] team would then [[receive]] a 100.000 dollar [[reward]]. They do this because they [[believe]] that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the [[kids]] do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about [[life]], it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to [[draw]] from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian [[Prince]], a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money.

"OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called ""Death Bed"" that came out a few years back, because this one is ""The Bed That Eats"". And how do I even begin to describe this? Well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. This is as a result of demon teardrops, which of course affect most things, I guess, in a negative way. The bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting, and collects all the non-edible goodies (jewelry, etc) that the bed passes on. He died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah. The thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty [[deadpan]]. The movie is divided into several ""acts"", I guess, ""Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, & Just Desserts"". For fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre, well, this may just be right up your alley.

Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind.

"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome.

Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after [[killing]] a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the [[run]] from the cops and from his own Army comrades.

For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with.

"Had no idea what I was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940. However, I always enjoy viewing Laraine Day, (Katie Lattimer) who [[plays]] the role as a younger sister to Jean Muir, (Helen Lattimer) and also their mother, Billie Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). [[Thought]] I was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with Robert Cummings, (Ridley Crane) who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car. It is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely [[hold]] your [[attention]] [[right]] to the very end of the film.","Had no idea what I was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940.

"[[I]] first [[saw]] this movie when I was in elementary school, back in the 1960s. I was fascinated with the character played by Ingrid Bergman and it was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the movie is the [[best]] as she comes back to exact some revenge on her father's wife and daughter (her mother had been driven out in disgrace). During this time she meets the wonderful Clint Maroon, [[played]] by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the [[two]] is [[great]]. The [[second]] half of the movie [[takes]] [[place]] in Saratoga, NY (the Saratoga of the title) and I never enjoy it as much as the [[New]] Orleans setting but it's still very [[good]]. I give this movie a ten - partly out of nostalgia but mostly because it's just a [[darn]] [[good]] movie and the characters besides those of Bergman and Cooper are equally wonderful (Flora Robson [[comes]] [[close]] to [[stealing]] the scenes from Bergman). It used to be shown on [[TV]] periodically but it's shown rarely if ever - it would be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and put into their programming cycles.","[[one]] first [[meet]] this movie when I was in elementary school, back in the 1960s.

"Hailing from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most [[frustrating]] Fulci [[film]] I've [[seen]] to [[date]], prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get [[worse]] as you get later into his career.

Sure, it's unlikely that just [[one]] [[man]] would be the host for so much screwed-up pathology all at once ([[addict]], psycho/sociopath, [[cannibal]]), but this is Fulci!<br /><br />Touch is actually the [[cheapest]] and sparsest [[looking]] Fulci film I've [[seen]]. There's [[almost]] [[nobody]] in it, even in the background of shots out on the street, for [[instance]]. A newsreader who keeps appearing on the film's televisions to warn the non-existent [[cast]] about the maniac's [[latest]] doings [[operates]] out of the most [[pathetic]] [[TV]] studio on the planet.

The [[film]] [[also]] [[looks]] bland and [[ugly]] in general. I've [[read]] that it was [[intended]] to be an Italian telemovie (did it [[ever]] [[screen]] in that venue?

Sometimes conspicuously cheerful or 'wacky' [[music]] is used to play against a gruesome scene, for instance while the hero/villain is carving up a dead body in his basement. The effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy.<br /><br />There are of course some redeeming moments of gore (that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven(!) of a woman who just won't quit life, even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club, and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features, it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women. The black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general.
