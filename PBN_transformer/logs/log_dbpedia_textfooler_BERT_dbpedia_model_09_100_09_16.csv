"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by [[fining]] a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

"Augustus George Hazard ([[April]] 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was [[born]] in Kingston, Rhode Island on April 28, 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering [[sorceress]] and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a fictional character in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"AIA Group Limited known as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest independent public listed pan-Asian life insurance group. It has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season.

However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season. In June 2014, AIA Singapore was named \""Best Employer to Work For in Asia\"" and received the award from HR Asia.",0.5131967067718506,0.5131967067718506,4,4,0,1,"Skipped"

"The Nedbank [[Golf]] Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf tournament [[played]] at the [[Gary]] [[Player]] Country [[Club]] in [[Sun]] [[City]], North West [[province]], [[South]] Africa.

Like [[many]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas.

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope.

Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, [[petitioned]] Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255.

Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers. The first issue of Girl Germs was completed by December 1990. While home in Washington, D.C. on winter break, Neuman made several hundred copies of the zine at the Capitol Hill offices of Arizona Representative Mo Udall, who she had worked for during high school. [[Contributor]] to Girl Germs included Kathleen Hanna; Jean Smith of Mecca Normal; Sue P. Fox; Kaia Wilson; the editors of Double Bill, G.B. Jones, Jena von Brücker, Caroline Azar, Johnny Noxzema and Rex; Jen Smith; and Erin Smith of Bratmobile. Groups interviewed by Girl Germs editors include Calamity Jane, Unrest, 7 Year Bitch, Jawbox and Fastbacks. Girl Germs also documents the coming together of Bratmobile, during this time. Allison would go on to play with Cold Cold Hearts, Partyline, and Hawnay Troof and Molly played with The Frumpies and The PeeChees. Archives that have copies of Girl Germs include the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco, California, the Independent Publishing Resource Center in Portland, Oregon, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and Barnard College.",0.10818767547607422,0.994849443435669,1,0,1,222,"Successful"

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

The [[bright]] E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the Hungaria [[family]], which [[form]] the innermost [[dense]] [[concentration]] of [[asteroids]] in the [[Solar]] [[System]]. The asteroid [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.7–2.1 [[AU]] once [[every]] 2 [[years]] and 8 [[months]] (977 [[days]]). Its orbit [[has]] an [[eccentricity]] of 0.11 and an [[inclination]] of 22° with [[respect]] to the ecliptic. The first [[observation]] was [[taken]] at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, [[extending]] the asteroid's [[observation]] arc by 8 [[years]] [[prior]] to its [[discovery]]. [[In]] March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this [[asteroid]] was [[obtained]] from photometric [[observations]] by [[U]].[[S]]. [[astronomer]] [[Brian]] [[D]]. Warner at his Palmer [[Divide]] [[Observatory]] (PDO), Colorado. [[It]] [[gave]] a [[long]] [[rotation]] [[period]] of 105.7±0.1 [[hours]] with a [[brightness]] [[variation]] of 0.60 in [[magnitude]] ([[U]]=3-). The period was [[derived]] from a re-examined light-curve that [[originally]] [[gave]] a [[much]] [[shorter]] period of 30.72±0.02 [[hours]] with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude ([[U]]=0). [[This]] [[previously]] [[published]] [[period]] was only [[preliminary]] and is now [[considered]] [[wrong]] upon re-examination. [[According]] to the [[survey]] [[carried]] out by the NEOWISE [[mission]] of NASA's Wide-field [[Infrared]] [[Survey]] [[Explorer]], the asteroid [[measures]] 4.8 [[kilometers]] in diameter and its surface [[has]] an albedo of 0.28, while the [[Collaborative]] [[Asteroid]] Lightcurve [[Link]]  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a [[compromise]] [[value]] between 0.4 and 0.2, [[corresponding]] to the Hungaria asteroids as [[family]] and [[orbital]] [[group]], [[respectively]] – and [[calculates]] a [[diameter]] of 4.6 [[kilometers]], [[based]] on an [[absolute]] [[magnitude]] of 13.7. The [[minor]] [[planet]] was [[named]] for the [[city]] of [[San]] [[Diego]], California, in [[appreciation]] of the [[city]] council's [[efforts]] to [[reduce]] the [[local]] [[light]] [[pollution]] ([[see]] dark-sky [[movement]]). Palomar [[mountain]] is [[located]] within San [[Diego]] [[County]], California, and the [[astronomers]] at the [[site]] were [[concerned]] that the light pollution from the [[city]] would [[ruin]] their [[ability]] to [[use]] the [[observatory]]. The [[council]] had [[voted]] to [[use]] Low-Pressure [[Sodium]] ([[LPS]]) vapor [[lamps]] for their street lights. [[This]] fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

"Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a [[prior]] of the Carthusian [[Grand]] Chartreuse and [[bishop]] of Belley. He was born near Chambéry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm [[continued]] in his [[office]] almost [[constantly]] for twenty-four [[years]], barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and [[helped]] [[defend]] the [[sitting]] Pope [[Alexander]] [[III]] against the antipope [[Victor]] [[IV]]. [[Alexander]] [[III]] [[appointed]] Anthelm [[bishop]] of Belley in 1163. In that [[position]], he is [[said]] to [[have]] been fearless and uncompromising, [[working]] to [[reform]] the [[clergy]] and regulate the [[affairs]] of the diocese.

The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.","Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.
