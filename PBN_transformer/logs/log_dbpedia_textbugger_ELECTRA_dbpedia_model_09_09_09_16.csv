"On 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football [[Club]] faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the [[1990]]‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the [[field]] were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 [[Octobe‚≤Ö]] 1990, Manchester United Football [[C‚Öºub]] faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixùöùure]] at Old Trafford, during the [[19‡ß≠0]]‚Äì91 season.

[[The]] raid was the final action in a series of [[engagements]] fought by the [[British]] [[squadron]] based in the [[Indian]] Ocean against the Dutch [[naval]] forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the [[Dutch]] squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last [[Dutch]] warships in the [[region]].

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli.

"[[AIA]] [[Group]] [[Limited]] known as [[AIA]] (Chinese: ÂèãÈÇ¶‰øùÈö™ÊéßËÇ°ÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏) is the [[largest]] independent public [[listed]] pan-Asian [[life]] insurance [[group]]. It has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, [[wholly]] [[owned]] branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, [[New]] Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a [[26]]% [[joint]] venture in [[India]], and [[representative]] offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. [[AIA]] traces its [[roots]] back to 1919 when an enterprising young [[man]] named Cornelius Vander [[Starr]] opened an [[insurance]] agency in Shanghai, China. Vander [[Starr]] eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of [[New]] York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as [[ALICO]] (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New [[York]]. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it [[would]] buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an [[IPO]] in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the [[world's]] third [[largest]] IPO [[ever]]. In September [[2012]], AIA agreed to acquire a 92.[[3]]% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva [[NDB]] Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National [[Development]] [[Bank]] ([[NDB]]).

[[A]] [[IA]] traces its [[root—ï]] back to 1919 when an enterprising young [[mn]] named Cornelius Vander [[Star]] opened an [[insuranœ≤e]] agency in Shanghai, China. Vander [[Star‚≤Ö]] eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of [[Nw]] York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as [[ALCIO]] (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New [[Yorùíå]].

In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World [[Student]] [[Team]] Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the best result for [[board]] 4 ([[8]]/9). The following year, he had a terrific [[result]] at the USSR Championship, [[sharing]] [[second]] [[place]] with [[Boris]] [[Gulko]], [[Mikhail]] [[Tal]] and [[Rafael]] [[Vaganian]], after [[Tigran]] [[Petrosian]]. In 1976, his [[Grandmaster]] [[title]] was ratified.

Playing the [[Hungarian]] Open Championship at Gy√∂r in 1990 he enjoyed a most [[impressive]] [[victory]], finishing a clear [[2]] points ahead of the [[field]]. [[Second]] [[place]] finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were [[also]] important landmarks in his career, as was his [[3rd]]= finish at Sochi in [[1982]]. [[Nowadays]] [[less]] active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly [[competitive]] rating and is able to [[win]] smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as [[Solin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra ([[Rome]]) [[2005]]. At the Olympiads he represented the [[Soviet]] Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team [[Chess]] Championships his medal haul has amounted to an [[incredible]] [[6]] gold and [[1]] silver. His [[chess]] [[playing]] style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a [[junior]]. Along with a group of other [[aspiring]] masters, he was [[first]] coached by [[Viktor]] Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a [[senior]] master as a [[tutor]]/mentor. In his case the master was [[Mikhail]] Tal, an ex-world [[champion]] noted for his [[attacking]] [[chess]]. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of [[rare]], offbeat and [[sometimes]], [[long]] since [[discarded]] systems. [[Only]] by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. [[The]] newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[O‚Öºeg]] [[Mikhailovic’∞]] Romanishin ([[bo‚≤Ön]] 10 [[Janua‚≤Öy]] [[195·íø]] in [[Lvi—µ]]) is a [[Uk‚≤Öainian]] [[ches—ï]] [[grandmaste‚≤Ö]] and [[forme‚≤Ö]] [[Eu‚≤Öopean]] junior [[chaÔΩçpion]].

Playing the [[Hunga‚≤Öian]] Open Championship at Gy√∂r in 1990 he enjoyed a most [[impressi—µe]] [[victo‚≤Öy]], finishing a clear [[·íø]] points ahead of the [[fiel‘Å]]. [[Secon‘Å]] [[plaœ≤e]] finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were [[al—ïo]] important landmarks in his career, as was his [[3d]]= finish at Sochi in [[1892]]. [[Nowaday—ï]] [[les]] active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly [[competiti—µe]] rating and is able to [[‘ùin]] smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as [[Solni-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra ([[Roe]]) [[205]]. At the Olympiads he represented the [[Sovieùöù]] Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team [[Ches—ï]] Championships his medal haul has amounted to an [[incredib‚Öºe]] [[–±]] gold and [[l]] silver. His [[ches—ï]] [[p‚Öºaying]] style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a [[j’Ωnior]]. Along with a group of other [[aspi‚≤Öing]] masters, he was [[firsùöù]] coached by [[Vikto‚≤Ö]] Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a [[se’∏ior]] master as a [[tuto‚≤Ö]]/mentor. In his case the master was [[Mikhai‚Öº]] Tal, an ex-world [[ch…ëmpion]] noted for his [[attackin…°]] [[ches—ï]]. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of [[ra‚≤Öe]], offbeat and [[smetimes]], [[lnog]] since [[di]] [[scarded]] systems. [[O]] [[nly]] by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. [[T]] [[he]] newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.",0.19514602422714233,0.5030125379562378,0,0,0,2075,"Failed"

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], [[approximately]] [[4]].7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor [[Helin]] on 30 September [[1982]], at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the [[Hungaria]] family, which form the [[innermost]] dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar [[System]]. [[The]] asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days).

The first observation was taken at Crimea‚Äì[[Nauchnij]] in 1974, extending the [[asteroid's]] observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational [[light-curve]] for this asteroid was obtained from [[photometric]] observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory ([[PDO]]), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of [[105]].7¬±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-).

Due to its remote location, [[Ishpatina]] Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway [[560]], is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage [[via]] a logging [[road]] to the [[south]] out of the [[town]] of [[Capreol]] north of [[Sudbury]]. While a [[northern]] [[route]] exists (out of [[Gowganda]], the nearest [[community]]), there are numerous [[portages]] making it [[particularly]] onerous. [[This]] [[route]] has [[traditionally]] been [[used]] for a [[winter-time]] [[approach]] by ski/[[snowshoe]]. Historically, a fire [[tower]] atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. The name \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an Ojibwe language [[word]] [[ishpadinaa]], meaning \""high [[place]]/ridge\"".

An [[abandoned]] firetower, often [[referred]] to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is still [[standing]] on the highest [[section]] of the Ridge ([[left]]). The original tower was an 80 ft [[structure]] erected in [[1930]]. The successor, currently standing, is [[100]] ft high and was abandoned in the [[1960s]].

Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The [[elevation]] of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level.

Historically, a fire [[towe‚≤Ö]] atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane.

[[After]] graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in [[1968]], [[Beshear]] briefly [[practiced]] law in [[New]] York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the [[state]] legislature, where he gained a reputation as a [[consumer]] advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, [[Jr]]. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with [[first]] [[lady]] Phyllis [[George]] Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In [[1983]], Beshear was [[elected]] [[lieutenant]] governor in the administration of [[Governor]] Martha Layne [[Collins]]. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky [[Tomorrow]] Commission, a panel charged with [[making]] recommendations for the future of the [[state]]. [[Beshear's]] [[initial]] rise to [[political]] prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a [[five-candidate]] [[Democratic]] gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the [[second-place]] finisher in the primary, opened the door for [[political]] [[novice]] [[Wallace]] [[Wilkinson's]] well-financed campaign to [[achieve]] a come-from-behind upset in the race. [[For]] the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful [[challenge]] to Senator Mitch McConnell in [[1996]]. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn [[back]] into politics by the [[vulnerability]] of incumbent [[Republican]] Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by [[then-Attorney]] General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's [[merit]] system. In the [[2007]] gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a [[six-candidate]] Democratic primary ‚Äì largely on the strength of his [[pledge]] to [[expand]] casino gambling as a means of further [[funding]] social programs like [[education]] ‚Äì and defeated Fletcher in the [[general]] election. Beshear won [[re-election]] in [[2011]], defeating Republican David L. Williams and [[Independent]] Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.","[[St]] [[even]] Lynn \""[[Ste—µe]]\"" [[Bsehear]] ([[bo‚≤Ön]] [[Septembe‚≤Ö]] 21, 1944) is an [[Ameriœ≤an]] attorney and [[Democratiœ≤]] [[Parùöùy]] politician who was the 61st Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to [[215]].

The [[engagement]] was inconclusive and is most [[notable]] for the sinking of the English [[carrack]] [[Mary]] Rose. In [[1545]], [[Francis]] launched an invasion of England with 30,[[000]] soldiers in more than [[200]] ships. [[Against]] this armada ‚Äî [[larger]] than the [[Spanish]] Armada [[forty-three]] [[years]] later ‚Äî the English had about 80 [[ships]] and [[12]],[[000]] soldiers. [[The]] [[French]] [[expedition]] started disastrously, the flagship [[Carraquon]] perishing in an accidental [[fire]] at anchor in the Seine on [[6]] July 1545. Admiral Claude [[d'Annebault]] transferred his flag to La [[Maistresse]] which then ran aground as the [[fleet]] set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. [[The]] French entered the [[Solent]] and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the [[Sussex]] coast. The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch. On [[18]] [[July]] 1545 the [[English]] came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long [[range]], little damage being done on either [[side]]. La [[Maitresse]] was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although [[d'Annebault]] had to change his flagship again she was saved from [[foundering]]. On the night of 18 July Henry [[dined]] aboard Great Harry, the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] John Dudley, [[Viscount]] Lisle. The [[next]] day was calm, and the [[French]] employed their galleys against the immobile [[English]] vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary [[Rose]], the flagship of [[Vice]] Admiral [[George]] Carew, [[advanced]] to [[battle]], she foundered and sank with the loss of all but [[35]]‚Äì[[40]] of her [[crew]]. The [[exact]] reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the [[time]] that the crew had been [[negligent]] and forgot to [[close]] the [[lower]] [[gunports]] after [[firing]] at the galleys, so that when she [[heeled]] over in the breeze she [[took]] on [[water]] and turned over.

When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

"[[Dolomedes]] /[[d…íl…ôÀàmiÀêdiÀêz]]/ is a [[genus]] of [[large]] [[spiders]] of the family [[Pisauridae]]. They are also known as [[fishing]] spiders, raft spiders, dock [[spiders]] or wharf spiders. [[Almost]] all [[Dolomedes]] species are [[semi-aquatic]], with the exception of the tree-dwelling D. [[albineus]] of the southwestern United [[States]]. Many species have a [[striking]] [[pale]] stripe down each side of the body. [[They]] [[hunt]] by waiting at the edge of a [[pool]] or stream, then when they detect the [[ripples]] from prey, they run across the surface to [[subdue]] it using their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; like other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to kill and digest the prey. They [[mainly]] eat insects, but some larger species are able to catch small fish. They can also climb beneath the water, when they become encased in a silvery film of air. [[Six-spotted]] [[spiders]] can also walk on water to [[get]] their prey. Dolomedes is derived from the Greek word \""dolomed\"" which means [[wily]], deceitful.

"[[The]] Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box [[girder]] bridge over Back [[Creek]] at [[Taradale]], Victoria on the [[Bendigo]] [[Railway]] in Victoria [[Australia]]. [[It]] was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the [[time]] one of the largest [[rail]] [[bridges]] built in Australia. Construction of the [[Bendigo]] line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with [[financial]] difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the [[Victorian]] colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways [[Department]].

"Herbert [[Alexander]] [[Bruce]] FRCS ([[September]] [[28]], [[1868]] ‚Äì June [[23]], [[1963]]), served as the [[15th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. He [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during [[World]] [[War]] I, he was appointed [[inspector-general]] of the [[Canadian]] [[Army]] Medical Corps by [[Sir]] Sam [[Hughes]], and attained the rank of colonel in the [[Canadian]] [[Army]] (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the [[army]] and issued a Report on the Canadian [[Army]] Medical [[Service]] which [[urged]] a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his [[recommendations]] for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by [[Sir]] William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his [[conservative]] patron, [[Hughes]], was obliged to [[resign]]. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the [[Canadian]] [[Army]] [[Medical]] Corps, [[criticizing]] the government for its actions but avoiding any specific [[denunciation]] of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was [[able]] to advance some useful [[reforms]] in surgical management, [[including]] greater reliance on [[nurse-anesthetists]] and [[operating]] room technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce purchased a [[farm]] on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until [[1937]]. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to [[curtail]] the extravagance of the vice-regal [[office]] in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was [[closed]] by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting costs. While most [[lieutenant-governors]] are [[former]] politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering [[politics]] following his term as the King's representative. [[Following]] the sudden [[death]] of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the [[1940]] federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's [[seat]] in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] SL ([[1]] November [[1609]] ‚Äì 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treatise]] Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. [[Born]] to a [[barrister]] and his [[wife]], who had both [[died]] by the [[time]] he was [[5]], [[Hale]] was [[raised]] by his [[father's]] relative, a strict [[Puritan]], and inherited his faith. In [[1626]] he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen [[Hall]], [[Oxford]] (now [[Hertford]] College), intending to become a [[priest]], but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his [[father]] thanks to an encounter with a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November [[1628]] he joined [[Lincoln's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 [[May]] [[1636]]. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his [[state]] [[trial]], and conceived the [[defence]] Charles used. [[Despite]] the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the [[Hale]] Commission, which [[investigated]] law [[reform]]. [[Following]] the [[Commission's]] [[dissolution]], [[Oliver]] Cromwell [[made]] him a [[Justice]] of the [[Common]] Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to [[bribery]] and his willingness to make [[politically]] unpopular [[decisions]] which upheld the [[law]]. He sat in [[Parliament]], [[either]] in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and [[following]] the Declaration of Breda was the [[Member]] of [[Parliament]] who [[moved]] to consider Charles [[II's]] reinstatement as [[monarch]], sparking the [[English]] Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was [[made]] [[first]] Chief [[Baron]] of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both [[positions]], he was again [[noted]] for his [[integrity]], [[although]] not as a [[particularly]] innovative [[judge]]. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. [[Hale]] is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, [[published]] after his death. His Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, [[dealing]] with [[capital]] [[offences]] against the [[Crown]], is [[considered]] \""of the [[highest]] [[authority]]\"", while his Analysis of the Common [[Law]] is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until [[1991]], and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Si‚≤Ö]] [[Matt’∞ew]] [[Ha‚Öºe]] SL ([[l]] November [[169]] ‚Äì 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treati—ïe]] Historia [[Placitor’Ωm]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.

Left-arm unorthodox [[spin]] ([[left-arm]] [[wrist]] [[spin]]) is sometimes [[known]] as \""[[slow]] [[left-arm]] [[chinaman]]\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his [[honour]]. Achong was born in Belmont, Port of Spain. He [[played]] football as a left-winger for a [[local]] [[team]], Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[represented]] Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowler]]. His [[stock]] ball was [[left-arm]] orthodox spin ([[left-arm]] finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe [[Hardstaff]] [[Sr]]., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Learie]] Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the [[ball]]?\"" [[An]] [[unorthodox]] [[left-arm]] spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the [[leg]] side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded [[Test]] [[match]] player to [[bowl]] [[unorthodox]] left-arm spin ‚Äì that is believed to be [[Charles]] Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English [[cricket]] team from 1930 to [[1935]], three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 [[tour]] of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a [[bowling]] average of 47.[[25]], but his Test [[figures]] belie his much [[greater]] [[success]] at regional level in the West [[Indies]] between 1929‚Äì30 and 1934‚Äì[[35]]. In the final of the [[Inter-Colonial]] Tournament of 1931‚Äì32, he [[took]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to [[bowl]] Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He [[married]] during the 1933 tour of England and [[settled]] in [[Manchester]]. [[After]] his last Test match, he continued to play [[cricket]] for several clubs in the Lancashire [[Leagues]] until [[1951]], [[taking]] over [[1]],000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. [[He]] returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

Left-arm unorthodox [[sin]] ([[l–µft-arm]] [[wrisùöù]] [[sin]]) is sometimes [[kno‘ùn]] as \""[[slo‘ù]] [[l]] [[eft-arm]] [[chinman]]\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his [[honor]]. Achong was born in Belmont, Port of Spain. He [[playe‘Å]] football as a left-winger for a [[loca‚Öº]] [[teaÔΩç]], Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[represente‘Å]] Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowle‚≤Ö]]. His [[stocùíå]] ball was [[left-arÔΩç]] orthodox spin ([[lefùöù-arm]] finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe [[Hardstaf]] [[S‚≤Ö]]., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Leaire]] Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the [[bal]]?\"" [[A’∏]] [[unorthdox]] [[left-ram]] spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the [[‚Öºeg]] side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded [[Tesùöù]] [[matœ≤h]] player to [[–¨owl]] [[unorthoodx]] left-arm spin ‚Äì that is believed to be [[Charl–µs]] Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English [[cr]] [[icket]] team from 1930 to [[1]] [[935]], three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 [[tor]] of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a [[bowing]] average of 47.[[2∆º]], but his Test [[figure—ï]] belie his much [[greate‚≤Ö]] [[succes—ï]] at regional level in the West [[Indie—ï]] between 1929‚Äì30 and 1934‚Äì[[3∆º]]. In the final of the [[Inter-Colonia‚Öº]] Tournament of 1931‚Äì32, he [[tooùíå]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to [[bow‚Öº]] Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He [[marrie‘Å]] during the 1933 tour of England and [[settle‘Å]] in [[Manchestr]]. [[Afte‚≤Ö]] his last Test match, he continued to play [[crikcet]] for several clubs in the Lancashire [[Leagus]] until [[151]], [[taùíåing]] over [[l]],000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. [[H–µ]] returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply. Achong ultimately became a sports coach with the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education, coaching and selecting the Trinidad and Tobago cricket team.

At Opelika, US-431 and State Route 1 divert from US-280 and resume their northward orientation. East of Oxford, State Route 1 and US-431 merge with westbound Interstate 20 and run concurrently with Interstate 20 from Exit 191 to Exit 188. At Oxford, State Route 1 and US-431 begin a gradual northwestward trajectory, passing through Anniston, Gadsden and Guntersville. The two routes resume their northward orientation upon merging with U.S. Highway 231 at Huntsville. The portion through Oxford and Anniston is currently routed via Veterans Memorial Parkway as of December 21, 2015. Prior to this date, this portion was routed via Quintard Avenue, which constitutes the major north-south business and local route through these cities and is a congested route with many traffic signals and no room for widening.",0.1963520050048828,0.6804718375205994,2,0,2,497,"Successful"

An Australian [[internationa‚Öº]] and New [[Souùöùh]] Wales interstate representative fullback, he [[p‚Öºayed]] club [[footbal‚Öº]] in the [[Newcast‚Öºe]] [[R’Ωgby]] League for [[Ce]] [[ssnock]], in [[Sy‘Åney's]] NSWRFL Premiership for Balmain, and also in country Queensland and New South Wales during his career. Parkinson played four seasons in Newcastle for the Cessnock club before moving to Sydney. Signing with the Balmain club, the 1944 NSWRFL season was his first and at the end of it he played in the Premiership Final against Newtown which the Tigers won [[1-28]]. Balmain again reached the final in the [[194∆º]] NSWRFL season, which was a 22-18 loss against Eastern Suburbs. The following season Parkinson was selected to [[p‚Öºay]] representative football for Sydney against South Coast and was then a [[surpri—ïe]] selection for Australia, becoming Kangaroo no. 229 when he was chosen to play against the [[tou‚≤Öing]] Great Britain team. He [[mae]] [[s–µveral]] try-saving tackles, which earned him praise as the Kangaroos [[hel‘Å]] Great Britain to an [[8-al]] draw in the first test. Parkinson retained his place for the second test which the British won [[1-45]]. Again playing at fullback in the third test, after only 7 [[min’Ωtes]] Parkinson was [[t…ëckled]] heavily and suffered a [[broke’∏]] bone in his ankle. However he continued playing and Australia were further depleted when Arthur Clues was sent off for punching and the Kangaroos [[l–æst]] 20-7. Due to his injury Parkinson missed Balmain's victory over St George in the 1946 [[premier—ïhip]] decider. The following season he played in Queensland for Babinda as again Balmain won the premiership. Parkinson returned for the 1948 NSWRFL season and once again Balmain reached the premiership decider but lost 8-5 to Western Suburbs. Parkinson played at Parkes in 1949, then rejoined Cessnock in 1950. He played at fullback and kicked goals in each of Cessnock's Newcastle Rugby League grand [[final—ï]] wins of 1950, 1954 and 1955.

[[Kerferd]] emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. [[After]] trying his luck as a [[gold]] miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and [[wine]] merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other [[occasions]]. In 1853 he [[married]] Ann Martindale, with whom he had [[ten]] children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer.

"[[Athanasios]] John Traicos ([[born]] [[17]] [[May]] [[1947]]) is a former [[cricketer]] who represented South Africa and Zimbabwe at international level. He was primarily an off [[spin]] bowler, and is one of a [[small]] number of cricketers to have played at the highest level for more than one [[country]]. Traicos was born in [[Zagazig]], Egypt in 1947 where his father Tryphon worked in the family business. He is of Greek descent, his father having been [[born]] in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal [[grandmother]] in [[Kalymnos]], also in Greece. In [[September]] 1948 the family moved to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. As a child he was known as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his [[name]] \""Athanasios\"", but when he [[started]] university he adopted the [[name]] \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" within the South African domestic [[cricket]] [[setup]]. While a student at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by [[Trevor]] [[Goddard]] [[making]] his [[first-class]] debut on 24 June 1967 when he represented [[South]] African Universities against Cambridge University, [[taking]] 5‚Äì54 in the [[first]] innings. He represented the [[South]] African Universities team on two more occasions before making his [[Rhodesia]] debut on [[27]] [[January]] [[1968]]. He made his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain [[Ali]] Bacher. He took four catches and [[three]] wickets in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international cricket because of apartheid. Traicos continued to [[play]] for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, [[1986]] and [[1990]] ICC Trophy [[tournaments]].

"The [[zebra]] [[shark]] ([[Stegostoma]] fasciatum) is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae.

"[[The]] Usoi Dam is a [[natural]] landslide [[dam]] along the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. [[At]] 567 metres (1,860 ft) high, it is the tallest [[dam]] in the world, either [[natural]] or [[man-made]]. The [[dam]] was [[created]] on February 18, [[1911]], when the [[7]].4-Ms Sarez earthquake [[caused]] a massive [[landslide]] that [[blocked]] the flow of the [[river]]. The [[dam]] is [[formed]] of approximately 2 [[cubic]] kilometres (0.48 [[cu]] [[mi]]) of rock [[dislodged]] from the steeply sloped river valley of the [[Murghab]], which cuts from east to west through the high and [[rough]] [[Pamir]] Mountains. [[It]] is [[named]] after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 [[landslide]].

He [[served]] as a minister in the government of Albert Hawke. [[Kelly]] was born in Perth to Margaret [[Ann]] (n√©e [[Campbell]]) and [[John]] [[Kelly]]. He [[attended]] Christian [[Brothers']] College, Perth, and after [[leaving]] school [[went]] to the Gascoyne, [[managing]] a station near Gascoyne Junction. He [[served]] on the Upper [[Gascoyne]] Road [[Board]] from [[1927]] to 1928. Kelly later moved to [[Bullfinch]], a small town in the eastern Wheatbelt, where he ran a store. He was elected to the Yilgarn Road [[Board]] in 1929, and would serve until [[1943]]. Kelly first stood for parliament at the [[1939]] state election, as an \""independent [[Labor]]\"" candidate, but was defeated in the seat of Yilgarn-Coolgardie by the endorsed Labor candidate, George Lambert. Lambert died in office in June 1941, and Kelly won the resulting by-election as an \""independent Country\"" [[candidate]]. At the 1943 state election, Kelly was re-elected to [[Yilgarn-Coolgardie]] as a [[plain]] independent. [[However]], he [[joined]] the [[Labor]] [[Party]] in July 1946, and was re-elected unopposed as a [[Labor]] [[candidate]] at the [[1947]] state [[election]]. At the 1950 election, Kelly's seat was abolished, and he [[transferred]] to the [[new]] [[seat]] of Merredin-Yilgarn. After [[Labor's]] victory at the [[1953]] election, he was made Minister for Mines and Minister for [[Fisheries]] in the [[new]] [[ministry]] [[formed]] by [[Albert]] [[Hawke]]. He was also made Minister for Industrial Development in 1954. In a reshuffle in December 1957, he lost the mines and industrial development [[portfolios]], but was made Minister for Lands and Minister for Agriculture. The Labor government was defeated at the 1959 state election. [[Kelly]] remained in parliament until his [[retirement]] at the 1968 election. Merredin-Yilgarn had become increasingly marginal, and the [[replacement]] [[Labor]] candidate, James [[Brown]], was defeated by the Liberal [[Party's]] [[Jack]] [[Stewart]] ([[although]] Labor reclaimed the seat three years later).

"Belfast Central Library is a public library in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland.

On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland. Belfast Central Library houses a range of sections, including a lending library & Information and Business library still based in the original reading room. A Belfast, Ulster and Irish Department & Music Library on the top floor. It is a major provider of IT facilities on the ground floor providing free internet access.",0.9248420000076294,0.9248420000076294,2,2,0,1,"Skipped"
