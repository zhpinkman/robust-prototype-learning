"The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a [[good]] one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a [[slipshod]] job, you'd thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good.

"One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie [[happened]] this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and [[trying]] to [[figure]] out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger [[Corman's]] wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the [[impression]] it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some [[sort]] of calling card. [[Whatever]] the reasons she had to [[see]] it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time [[happened]] to be in the room I was working in, and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the tape.<br /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the far wall was a coat rack. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said ""I've seen [[enough]]."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Nope, sorry. Next! That's how long you've got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are [[dead]].<br /><br />I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this piece of [[crap]]. After an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several [[monkeys]] apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is boring! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men -<br /><br />- and the director crosses the line.<br /><br />The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up.

"Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Credible performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there.

"It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[poor]] films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film ""artsy and profound""--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! <br /><br />By the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue.

"I have yet to watch STARCRASH (1979) - that notoriously cheesy Italian take on STAR WARS (1977) - but it can't be much worse than this misbegotten piece of junk which, suffice it to say, makes Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS (1987) look like a veritable work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its leading lady - Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! <br /><br />Although Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks luminous in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.<br /><br />Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this s**t?"" There is little point in listing the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this stinker in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto!<br /><br />For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

"The 2002 [[version]] of ""The [[Time]] Machine"" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a [[lousy]], uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />The 2002 version must have [[H]].G Wells turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the time [[traveler]] is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an [[unfortunate]] and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. [[If]] Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?<br /><br />2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. The George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.<br /><br />3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.<br /><br />4. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is [[pointless]] -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.<br /><br />5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.<br /><br />7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.<br /><br />8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the ""talking rings"" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.<br /><br />Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.","The 2002 [[release]] of ""The [[time]] Machine"" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a [[great]], uninspired bland story, with no imagination.

"Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very [[likable]] story with a good moral. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' young Elizabeth Taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is [[enjoyable]] as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather [[limited]]. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply ""believing"" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically [[every]] unmemorable inspirational sporting [[film]] [[ever]] made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she [[works]] [[well]] with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star.

This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I'll wager that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.","Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very [[popular]] story with a good moral. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' young Elizabeth Taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is [[present]] as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather [[low]]. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being rather hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply ""believing"" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically [[this]] unmemorable inspirational sporting [[movie]] [[even]] made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she [[illustrates]] [[poorly]] with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. Anne Revere [[assumed]] a very [[significant]] role as Velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was [[defeated]] by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I [[guess]] that Mi was not told about this until the film's [[few]] seconds, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young [[lad]] would first need to develop his own [[lack]] of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late [[dad]] for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition.

Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such harm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo.

A little soft-core nonsense as filler, some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with naughty nurse behavior(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills, although the chilling score(..which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story).

This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck.

He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey.

"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible [[movies]]. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" [[could]] bring me back, so here I am.<br /><br />With that being [[said]], I like to start off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was [[going]] to be bad. But I had no idea that I would be [[spending]] 60 minutes out of a possible 90 [[minute]] film laughing at what I thought was a horror movie.<br /><br />Let's start with the [[biggest]] flaw of the film (to me that is). Ken Shamrock. Now if [[memory]] [[serves]] me correctly, Shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. [[Now]] if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid [[movie]] being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it [[looked]] to me). I mean how else do you explain all of his lines. My all time favorite line of his in this so called [[movie]] was ""It's been a long time coming"". OK????????? The funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the [[soon]] to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed. [[So]] if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to [[combat]] it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that it). [[Like]] [[I]] [[said]] before, he must have been the comic relief, except I don't [[think]] his UFC buddies where [[laughing]].<[[br]] /><br />Now that I've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.<br /><br />I'll admit that I [[can't]] remember a lot of scenes, and that's not [[good]] considering that [[I]] just watch the movie no more then fifteen [[minutes]] ago. So what I'm going to do is list the top five [[things]] wrong with this film 1. Usually when horror movie monster have their own theme [[music]], it's not heard by the victims or even by the [[monster]] itself. [[So]] why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this [[pathetic]] whistling. I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"[[At]] 20 years old, Francis [[Ouimet]] (Shia Lebouf) as his [[whole]] life ahead of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant [[family]] living in the late-19th to early-20th Century-era United States, class was a very [[limiting]] [[fact]] of life. [[If]] one is born poor, one [[stays]] poor; if one is [[born]] into the bourgeoisie, one has a tiny bit of opportunity; if [[one]] is born into the wealthy class, they [[essentially]] have it made in the shade. British gold champion Harry [[Vardon]] and Francis' golf idol (played by the [[criminally]] underrated Stephen [[Dillane]]) is the exception that proves the rule. Born and raised in a [[poor]] British family, his accomplished skill at golf [[allowed]] him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorest [[slums]] to the lush greens of the English country [[clubs]]. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francis [[wishes]] to follow in Vardon's footsteps and similarly uses his great [[skill]] at golf to [[get]] into the 1913 US Open at age 20. [[But]] a [[tough]] [[course]] and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis [[must]] deal with as a less-than-understanding father and cruel [[societal]] framework stand in his way of living his own [[dream]].<br /><br />I know what you are [[thinking]] - I thought it too - a Walt Disney produced film about the 1913 [[US]] Open starring the irritable Shia LaBeouf holds the possibility of being entertaining but it [[cannot]] [[possibly]] be a great film. Well, I am here to encourage you to think again. [[Despite]] what it may look to some on paper, [[The]] Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sport [[films]] in creation.<br /><br />[[As]] with every great sport film, The Greatest [[Game]] Ever Played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film *[[about*]] golf - it is a character centered film about [[using]] one's talents, following one's dreams, and breaking out of class barriers. [[Where]] [[The]] [[Greatest]] Game Ever [[Played]] works excellently as a [[themed]] sport film it also works just as [[well]] as a period film - the film's featured costumes and [[sets]] being the next best thing to actual time travel. [[The]] film also simply *looks* great and virtually [[unknown]] music composer Brian Tyler set the film to a [[wonderful]] piece of music. The cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful Stephen [[Dillane]] as British golfing [[champion]] Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as [[man's]] man golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh [[Flitter]] as Francis' pre-teenaged caddy Eddie, and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the lead role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) turns director here for the second time (directing a full-length feature) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. He produces a fine product - incorporating plenty of heart, ingenuity, and an attention to detail in the making of the film.","[[in]] 20 years old, Francis [[lives]] (Shia Lebouf) as his [[entire]] life ahead of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant [[families]] living in the late-19th to early-20th Century-era United States, class was a very [[limited]] [[thing]] of life. [[if]] one is born poor, one [[become]] poor; if one is [[put]] into the bourgeoisie, one has a tiny bit of opportunity; if [[two]] is born into the wealthy class, they [[never]] have it made in the shade. British gold champion Harry [[competes]] and Francis' golf idol (played by the [[very]] underrated Stephen [[ranks]]) is the exception that proves the rule. Born and raised in a [[strong]] British family, his accomplished skill at golf [[enabling]] him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorest [[homes]] to the lush greens of the English country [[club]]. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francis [[manages]] to follow in Vardon's footsteps and similarly uses his great [[abilities]] at golf to [[head]] into the 1913 US Open at age 20. [[and]] a [[tricky]] [[man]] and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis [[may]] deal with as a less-than-understanding father and cruel [[social]] framework stand in his way of living his own [[fantasy]].<br /><br />I know what you are [[experiencing]] - I thought it too - a Walt Disney produced film about the 1913 [[world]] Open starring the irritable Shia LaBeouf holds the possibility of being entertaining but it [[is]] [[really]] be a great film. Well, I am here to encourage you to think again. [[despite]] what it may look to some on paper, [[which]] Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sport [[filmmaking]] in creation.<br /><br />[[along]] with every great sport film, The Greatest [[match]] Ever Played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film *[[titled]] golf - it is a character centered film about [[realising]] one's talents, following one's dreams, and breaking out of class barriers. [[still]] [[this]] [[foremost]] Game Ever [[played]] works excellently as a [[wonderful]] sport film it also works just as [[thoroughly]] as a period film - the film's featured costumes and [[characters]] being the next best thing to actual time travel. [[both]] film also simply *looks* great and virtually [[perfect]] music composer Brian Tyler set the film to a [[timeless]] piece of music. The cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful Stephen [[marks]] as British golfing [[champions]] Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as [[family]] man golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh [[jackson]] as Francis' pre-teenaged caddy Eddie, and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the lead role as Francis.

And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a [[fail]] in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it [[must]] have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.<br /><br />On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A [[bad]] job! 9/10",0.018741965293884277,0.7010384798049927,1,0,1,298,"Successful"

"I'm [[astounded]] and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. [[It's]] not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. [[It's]] not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, [[typifies]] those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. [[It's]] not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's [[undeniably]] hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with [[authentic]] delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time.

"In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer.

"Empty shortening of John Irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd.

Garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close.(The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over as Garp reaches adulthood.) The story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. Williams gives a cherub-faced performance. This script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. He's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. John Lithgow's role as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, also doesn't make [[sense]].

"Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the [[fifth]] entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an [[English]] army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading).

[[With]] the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to [[turn]] the situation round. By pinning the [[murder]] of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British [[army]], the fragile British/[[Spanish]] alliance will start to crumble and things will [[turn]] [[around]] again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood though, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his [[death]] and [[soon]], he's off on a secret mission [[behind]] enemy lines to [[find]] out who masterminded the plot. [[Surprisingly]] enough for a Sharpe film as well, there's a [[gorgeous]] woman to be rescued along the way, fancy that.<br /><br />What this results in of [[course]] is a more adventure style approach. The concentration is less on the [[workings]] of the English military with [[Sharpe]] as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging [[French]] [[patrols]], hob [[nobbing]] with the [[Spanish]] guerrillas and getting involved in [[daring]] escapes from fortified military positions. [[Sergeant]] Harper, his [[loyal]] right hand man accompanies him naturally but the [[rest]] of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though, they [[actually]] [[receive]] more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's [[baby]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />This slightly different approach makes for an [[intriguing]] episode but is only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be [[worried]] that there won't be the [[standard]] battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor [[old]] French [[get]] a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a [[fantastic]] successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.","Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the [[5th]] entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an [[actual]] army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal [[ly]] which the rest of the army revolves around. [[should]] that be the [[problem]], I'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like [[fallen]] Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a [[quick]] choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. [[like]] the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to [[screw]] the situation round. By pinning the [[killing]] of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British [[armies]], the fragile British/[[spanish]] alliance will start to crumble and things will [[feel]] [[off]] again.

[[sergeant]] Harper, his [[supposed]] right hand man accompanies him naturally but the [[entirety]] of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of [[urban]] landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas [[retains]] the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />[[If]] life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now [[recognizes]] the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative [[light]], ""Den Brysomme mannen"" makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as [[quotidian]] life becomes a performance, which [[transforms]] Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

"Sean Connery is very [[good]] as the Great Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful.

"For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of [[film--and]] of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for [[films]] that I love, respect, and admire, and I have [[eagerly]] rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A [[life-long]] horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. I only recently began reviewing films for the IMDB, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which I believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. However, the existence of films like ""Graduation Day"" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. Completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 [[hodgepodge]] of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated [[embarrassment]] to horror cinema. During the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and Canadian) films such as ""Halloween II,"" ""Prom Night,"" ""Terror Train,"" ""Madman,"" ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Just Before Dawn,"" ""[[Final]] Exam,"" and ""Hell Night,"" among others. These films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone. Not every movie released during this bountiful season of the Slasher Era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th,"" but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. ""Graduation Day,"" an [[abysmal]] farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by Herb Freed, whom one can only hope will never again [[attempt]] to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. The task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. [[This]] movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense.

"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was [[awful]]. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing.

"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun.

I seem to remember at some [[moment]] a character, maybe Farina's mentions that the Mod Squad can [[dig]] in to places regular cops can't. The 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the toughest places to [[slip]] into, maybe it was student night? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just [[brought]] together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes.<br /><br />Was it an action comedy?

"[[After]] repeatedly saying how [[brilliant]] so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an [[episode]] with maximum points. ""Etude In Black"" is not 100 percent [[perfect]], but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <[[br]] /><[[br]] />Last week I reviewed ""Just Married"" and compared it [[unfavourably]] to ""Meet The Parents"". Well here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much [[earlier]] role as the wife of famous orchestral [[conductor]] Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with [[Jennifer]] Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first [[affair]], one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to [[leave]] his wife, but as his wife's mother [[holds]] the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't [[think]] it'd be such a smart move to [[destroy]] his career and marriage overnight. [[Instead]] he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and [[murder]] his young lover while making it look [[like]] a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to [[realise]] that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much [[longer]] for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and [[soon]] [[he's]] following him around wherever he goes. [[Even]] [[though]] Columbo is certain Alex is his man, it [[actually]] [[takes]] [[quite]] a while and a few false leads ([[none]] of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital [[piece]] of evidence.<[[br]] /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch extra characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer [[Wells]] and the English mechanic who sounds [[like]] he [[would]] be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had [[also]] been seeing Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). [[And]] there's [[even]] a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police [[Academy]] [[films]]. [[As]] with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In [[Waiting]]"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. [[From]] the [[moment]] she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity.

So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.)

"I am a glutton for B-movies. I [[love]] the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. It is cheezy. It is gory. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high.

There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. Don't expect Romero, just second-rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast [[trip]] through B-movie Land.",0.22440093755722046,0.5151028633117676,1,0,1,166,"Successful"
"A film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. [[Yet]] human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. What's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was [[quite]] typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are [[changing]], [[especially]] when the [[president]] of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to [[journalists]] speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of [[course]] relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement.

[[One]] has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a [[young]] boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another [[still]] with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so naïve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice.

"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*<br /><br />I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a [[perfect]] mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

"[[The]] first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an [[X-rated]] [[Musical]] Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends.

Obviously it was the soft-core edited ([[chopped]]) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its [[original]] integral version. Well, more then 20 years [[went]] by, during which I forgot all about this [[movie]] and, only a few days ago, by sheer chance, I stumbled upon a [[heavily]] [[used]] VHS copy (which had seen better times: a bit [[washed-out]] colors, scratchy sound and a few flaws), but [[guess]] what? It's the original uncut version and, this [[time]], I [[really]] had a ball! Humor, Musical and Porn may [[sound]] an awkward combination but, in this [[case]], it really works and, unlikely the big majority of boring porn-flicks nowadays invading our screens, this is a [[really]] [[amusing]] and entertaining sex fantasy, which will not disappoint you. [[The]] direction is clever, the swift editing makes the [[movie]] fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain [[funny]], all the actors [[seem]] having a [[good]] time, the songs are catchy (worth mentioning the one about ""[[growing]] up"" sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious ""[[What's]] a nice girl like you doing on a Knight [[like]] this""), the dance numbers are [[well]] choreographed and staged ([[amazingly]] energetic Terry Hall proves that she can ""also"" [[dance]] and dances enthusiastically her guts away...[[Don't]] worry, she [[also]] does what she was best known for...), the acting, the singing, the [[set]], the [[costumes]] are of quality level and then...there is Kristine ""Blue Eyes"" DeBell, in the first starring [[role]] of her career and (oh [[boy]]!) she [[indeed]] has a few H.C. sequences!

[[She]] is young and (ohhh!) so very pretty; with the [[help]] of her new friends in Wonderland, she [[discovers]] her body and her sexuality so, she [[sings]], she [[dances]] and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable.

I give it a 9 out of 10.","[[a]] first time I saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an [[amazing]] [[musical]] Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. City with some friends. I remember we [[really]] [[enjoy]] it very much, although we were left wondering why all the ""[[things]]"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the [[film]] was suddenly [[jumps]] from one scene to the next one, leaving [[ourselves]] [[surprised]]...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core edited ([[original]]) version, which left me with the desire to watch it again soon, but in its [[most]] integral version. Well, more then 20 years [[came]] by, during which I forgot all about this [[movies]] and, only a few days ago, by sheer chance, I stumbled upon a [[beautifully]] [[made]] VHS copy (which had seen better times: a bit [[unusual]] colors, scratchy sound and a few flaws), but [[did]] what? It's the original uncut version and, this [[evening]], I [[totally]] had a ball! Humor, Musical and Porn may [[consider]] an awkward combination but, in this [[respect]], it really works and, unlikely the big majority of boring porn-flicks nowadays invading our screens, this is a [[truly]] [[fantastic]] and entertaining sex fantasy, which will not disappoint you. [[every]] direction is clever, the swift editing makes the [[scenes]] fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain [[hilarious]], all the actors [[are]] having a [[great]] time, the songs are catchy (worth mentioning the one about ""[[grow]] up"" sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious ""[[get]] a nice girl like you doing on a Knight [[after]] this""), the dance numbers are [[obviously]] choreographed and staged ([[particularly]] energetic Terry Hall proves that she can ""also"" [[do]] and dances enthusiastically her guts away...[[nobody]] worry, she [[now]] does what she was best known for...), the acting, the singing, the [[sets]], the [[costume]] are of quality level and then...there is Kristine ""Blue Eyes"" DeBell, in the first starring [[roles]] of her career and (oh [[oo]]!) she [[quite]] has a few H.C. sequences!

"Eisenstein's first sound film [[retells]] the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the [[Livonian]] knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious [[stand-ins]] for the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian town seems a prophetic [[warning]] of the massacres of World War II. [[The]] film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in [[delicate]] black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's [[return]] to official favor. By the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. [[Nevsky's]] strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history: [[never]] before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev's beautiful, [[haunting]] soundtrack (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time).

"CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the Sydney Opera House'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.","CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia.

"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /><br />I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true.

"I saw this on the shelves at the rental place and I have rented everything else so I said why not. Why not is because it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It looks like it was shot with home camcorder. I guess thats all the budget would allow. There was less boobs in it than I thought there would be. Some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings. The funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff. There is a spot with deleted scenes. Well there is only one but it is the dumbest and I think it may have brought the rest of the movie down. The girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom.

"I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book either Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend, Charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because of Charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang leaded by Manny Franker. After some altercation during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the New York City in the hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time, everywhere and everyday. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker who know his profile well and like him very much. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang.<br /><br />I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action film which I had seen from the past. This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. [[No]] ponderous story-telling and less unnecessary scenes which was the one merit of the movie. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. I believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the crude, extreme and blast of action for every minutes of the movie, especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of Manny Franker which I thought that it was the maximum action scene.<br /><br />For about the cast, I think everyone was good and get through their role. Charles Bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the ""big old cat"", but the great vigilante. Gavan [[O'Herlihy]] also did his job very good. His main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by Franker and his follower to make a heat on Paul Kersey. She could have more role to appear.<br /><br />For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans. Fast-paced with back and Forth style made this movie very interested to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money. Haha! that's like a joke! Although, I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey.<br /><br />In another case, the ending scene of the movie set back me. It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him. I thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Film's movie, but I dislike it.<br /><br />For the summary, I am OK with Death Wish 3 due to my explanation I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even it had some scene I don't like.

"Victor Buono as the Devil? Surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made.

"If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time for a blank stare.

The movie about his troubled life is good, not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-worn biopic outline. Super-talented youngster battles adversity, achieves greatness while also self-destructing, then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' flaws (heroin abuse, chronic womanizing, persistent bastard-fathering) even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.<br /><br />Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx stride for stride. What takes him to a different level, though, is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his headstrong mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music exec.

"Pixote is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality. And yet I more than imagine Hector [[Babenco]] owes some of his film-making chops with this film to [[Vittorio]] De Sica's neo-realist style, in particular Shoeshine (that [[film]], as with Pixote, [[takes]] place mostly inside a children's prison). And yet while I might still prefer De Sica's film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is, no pun intended, like choosing between two children. They're both [[marvelous]] works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions [[brought]] on after a world war. This is how it was in Brazil- one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in City of God, perhaps in some of the same locations- and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made. Some aren't alive some 20+ years later, for all anyone knows.<br /><br />The ""star"", pre-teen street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him, and placed among dozens of other street kids and delinquents in a reformatory for boys. The conditions couldn't be much worse, and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty. There's a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the film we find Pixote with a few other youths, including Lilica a practical transvestite not even 18, and they become pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever to get by. None of this, I should repeat, is shown with a [[kind]] of ham-fisted earnestness- certainly you would never in a million [[years]] see Ron Howard or Paul Haggis direct this [[kind]] of picture- and [[yet]] [[there's]] an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is [[trivialized]].<br /><br />Nearly [[every]] scene is significant to showing how fragile [[life]] is for Pixote, and how he could be killed or die some [[way]] at any turn, and so without even reaching puberty [[yet]] he has to be on the level of those around him who are a [[little]] older ([[though]] not by much at all) and become things that will haunt this person [[forever]]. Despite Babenco's usage of a tender and mournful musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot, nothing feels forced. As with De Sica, maybe more-so given the consistent conditions of San Paolo and Rio street kids, he's a natural director of children, and coax's out of Ramos da Silva and Jorge Julião and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of ""cinematic"" drama (that is not so real that it becomes documentary, which isn't a bad thing per-say) and even subtlety in some scenes.<br /><br />Pixote may not be as well known as it's later 21st century Brazilian films that look back on the horrors of Rio, or even neo-realist films, but it should be.

"-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* <br /><br />-""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past. Whiles there she meets up with two lesbians and after a couple of drinks the two decide to have some fun. But one of the girls takes things a bit too far and rapes her whiles the second girl holds her down. She is discovered on the beach where the incident happens the next day and is taken to a hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the movie watching her attempting to bring down the two girls and at the same time learn some new info about who she is and where she comes from and a bit about her past.<br /><br />-Director and co-writer Caryn Krooth does an [[excellent]] job with this movie considering its uber low budget. It hand-held and sometimes looks like 16mm but it fits the movie since the story demands a harsh look to it. The actors all do okay jobs with what is given to them and there's not really anything to complain about it. The standout feature in the movie is of course Carla Gugino who bares it all in this movie. She is actually more nude in this movie than she is in ""Sin City"". Christopher McDonald is also in the movie but his character is really kinda pointless, but he is fun to watch. I didn't really pay much attention to the music since it doesn't really draw attention to itself but it gets the job done with what it's got. The movie is R rated and it's that for a very good reason. it's very sexual and very graphic at times. It's essentially borders on soft core at times but the sex scenes are necessary for the movie so it doesn't feel like it's just there for the sake of being there. Although there is one pointless scene where we see Chris McDonald getting it on, that scene was a tad pointless but it's not really much of a problem I guess. The only fault with the movie is that we don't get to see the court trial after all that we go through in the movie. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something <br /><br />-It's a shame that the talented Caryn Krooth has never made a feature film since this. This is a highly gifted woman can do great things with a very little budget. I really hope that she gets back in the game soon because she is an amazing director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, instead what we have is an enjoyable movie that shows a great director in the making.<br /><br />-Hide the kids and close the curtains, you don't want people to think you're watching porn whiles watching this movie.","-it has Carla Gugino *yay* and a crappy ending *boo* <br /><br />-""Jaded"" is a highly erotic story about a beautiful woman who arrives in a town trying to escape her past.

"At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago.<br /><br />It's all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.<br /><br />This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also deals [[brilliantly]] with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being.

That has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. <br /><br />In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.","At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago.<br /><br />It's all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.<br /><br />This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also deals [[terribly]] with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the [[one]] experience she had imagined it to be. <br /><br />Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: I [[strongly]] [[question]] how this sequence had all the [[potential]] erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked out of it because of the [[original]] scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket.

"I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max. After having viewed Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I have to say that the 'uncut' DVD version was both [[great]] and disappointing. The U.S. version is so *much* better than the DVD (European?) version. The U.S. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible. Feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact one ""new"" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when Caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. I love this scene, in the U.S. version though. On the DVD, the male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. It's the pinnacle of hilarity:<br /><br />""It'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!"" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. I was floored when I saw this. It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. I'm glad Hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made for the U.S. version that make Lifeforce that much better and I wished the DVD had the U.S. version. The editing is sharp and frenzied without being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the U.S. version are even more boring on the DVD version because of added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the U.S. version. More subtle.<br /><br />I [[love]] this film. It's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much Lifeforce as possible. The film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really [[shines]] in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They're the best Apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. It's also the best zombie movie ever. The zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. Not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. Also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />And to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />As for the DVD, well, it ain't great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp U.S. version on a DVD, and with commentary by Hooper and Dykstra.","I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max.

"The cast alone tells you this will be a [[notch]] above the usual Italian western.

[[One]] expects the ""hero"" in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective, but ""Clay McCord"" is an extreme example and, [[surprisingly]] enough, he's often shone in a passive, even weak position. Much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord -- don't you love that name? -- is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display. There's even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, most in evidence when he's used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street. Not only does he often fail to protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Nearly everyone who helps him is killed. <br /><br />While ""A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die"" is far from being a complete success, it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory.

"The Golden Door is the story of a [[Sicilian]] family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). [[Salvatore]], a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, [[persuades]] his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, [[clever]] and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon [[Salvatore]] as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to [[suggest]] wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically [[interwoven]] with the characters and helps [[nicely]] compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the [[dark]] reality of the Sicilian people helps provide [[hope]] while they're aboard the ship to the New World.<br /><[[br]] />The voyage to the New World is shot [[almost]] in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and [[nearly]] kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the [[New]] World. The Old World is depicted as [[somewhat]] destitute and primitive. [[This]] is shown as [[Salvatore]] scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has [[left]] (donkeys, [[goats]] and rabbits) in order to [[obtain]] the [[appropriate]] clothing he needs to enter the New World. I [[thought]] it was [[rather]] [[interesting]] that these people believed they had to conform to a [[certain]] dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a [[particular]] stereotype or mold in order to be [[recognized]] as morally fit. [[The]] most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and [[setting]] sail for the New World. This shot shows an [[overhead]] [[view]] of a crowd of people who slowly seem to [[separate]] from one another, [[depicting]] the separation between the Old and New Worlds. [[This]] shot also suggested that the people were being torn [[away]] from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their [[previous]] dark living conditions and were desirous to [[enter]] a world that held more promise.<br /><[[br]] />[[As]] later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct.

From the opening there is a [[problem]] with subtlety: the monsters are shown in the first [[shot]]! [[The]] opening dream sequence shows too much for too [[long]]. [[Our]] hero doesn't display professional acting skills (but no one [[expected]] that from this bastard genre). [[There]] are killings that one wishes were more interesting.

[[there]] are killings that one wishes were more interesting. [[even]] we have David Cronenberg. The man was [[even]] [[remotely]] [[supposed]] to be an actor. He fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist [[instead]], but what he should have done was [[stay]] behind the camera and save this disaster. Then we [[resort]] to [[nothing]], a creepy fake graveyard with an over-creepy fake gate. [[those]] thing is not a [[gross]] improvement over the cemetery in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. [[she]] gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There is nothing really [[serious]] with the character design and make-up effects here ([[really]]... [[if]] for the guy with no scalp, the [[girl]] with a pointy chin and forehead, and the [[pretty]] guy with dark circles around his eyes), the [[answer]] is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is [[involving]] them. Barker's photography of the subterranean [[town]] is tired and this [[portion]] of the story could have been made much better. [[that]] might [[make]] what follows SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes ""nightbreed"" we wait [[here]] to [[hear]] what he'll turn into (there's talk of [[animals]] that fly and werewolves), but when the time [[left]] for him to change they appearantly thought their hero too pretty to [[make]] a [[bad]] creature design. [[so]] the turn in Cronenberg's ""character"" the story just [[plays]] less interesting until the battle of freaks [[is]]. norms (which is just bad). Barker's mythology [[left]] him here. [[there]] is no genius and little originality [[among]] any of NIGHTBREED. [[a]] picture could have used a [[bigger]] budget, a serious script, and character design that doesn't [[help]] you saying ""oh...oh, how lame."" What a waste. Not scary, not [[clever]], not even very dark, just weak.",0.016858935356140137,0.021539270877838135,0,0,0,1041,"Failed"
"Don't you just hate them slashers that never seem to get started? It sometimes takes them a full hour of lame red herrings before some real action takes place. ""Tourist Trap"" isn't like that! If it's typically gruesome slashing you want...than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get! Plenty of it AND constantly from start to finish! This movie contains what is probably the greatest opening sequence in 80's horror cinema when a teenager, on a stroll after engine trouble, is trapped in a deserted house and assaulted by a creepy collection of wax statues. Four other lambs to the slaughter arrive at the house and encounter an utterly insane maniac that looks somewhat like a mixture of Leatherface (from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and one of those mad sculptors from old wax-museum movies. ""Tourist Trap"" is exciting horror entertainment, with some genuine suspense, grisly images, ultimate weirdness, morbid humor and terrific make-up effects. The plot twists aren't always original and the acting is pretty lousy but, seriously, who cares? The fast pacing and the groovy killer-icon caused this ""Tourist Trap"" to earn a spot amongst my 5 favorite slashers. A bit [[surprising]] is the total lack of nudity, though.

"On [[many]] [[levels]] it's very good.

I don't [[know]] how much it cost. The figure of £8,000 was [[bandied]] about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure [[like]] that is. [[The]] point is that this film looks like it [[cost]] a couple of million quid and it [[clearly]] cost a tiny fraction of that Great special effects, [[terrific]] production design, effective [[props]] and costumes, excellent photography, good acting and direction, an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix. Even having [[said]] that, much of the script was [[great]]. [[The]] characters were clearly identified and all had something to do. This is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless blanks but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things. Throughout the middle act, when the plot was developing, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film was like the second act, it would be [[stunning]].<br /><br />Before the ship blows up, twelve people make it to individual escape pods or 'e-pods' which blast away from the ship. They're not much more than automatic metal coffins and the poor sods inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea where they're going - but that makes sense. I like the e-pods - they're an [[excellent]] idea done very well and make more sense than a nice, roomy escape capsule. I also like the way that we are specifically told, later, that they are designed for ship-to-ship escape but can just about make planetfall in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were bloody [[lucky]] that their ship was blown up so [[close]] to a planet. That said, it doesn't look to me like there are 116 unused e-pods still on the freighter and you have to wonder how the prisoner is able to get into an e-pod - but in he gets. ([[And]] it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the Captain have gone down with his ship rather than being the [[first]] guy out of there?) Anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren [[planet]] with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way that he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterisation.","On [[several]] [[level]] it's very good.

Anyway, the e-pods all land on a barren [[place]] with nothing but sand and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way that he now points out that his name is David and the Captain starts using it, treating him with dignity and respect. That was good storytelling and good characterisation.",0.025429606437683105,0.5849218964576721,1,0,1,655,"Successful"

Anyway, the basic story is alright I suppose although it's a tad [[dull]] & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some [[sort]] of evil character running around bumping off our annoying American [[teen]] cast, you know the drill by now. Besides some brief & undeveloped [[nonsense]] about [[Dr]]. Chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating [[body]] there's not much story here & the script seems to exist [[solely]] to invent situations for [[girls]] to take their tops off, there's the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen [[without]] her full compliment of clothing. Oh, & when I say topless I mean they aren't [[wearing]] any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any [[actual]] [[full]] frontal nudity in [[Dr]]. Chopper at all. So there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clichéd dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe I'm just being picky.<br /><br />Director Schoenburn does OK actually, this is by no means the worst looking film I've seen although it still looks cheap. There's no style here, I didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. The gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.<br /><br />Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. The acting is alright, it could have better but I've certainly seen worse.<br /><br />Dr. Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.","Dr. Chopper starts shortly after teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it [[helps]] that his mum owns a log cabin at Lake [[macquarie]] the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about.

And they're sufficiently revolting that I couldn't help thinking this [[movie]] had better be pretty good to make up for this Grand Guignol opening.<br /><br />Alas, it's not. The acting is uniformly [[terrible]], as in a high school play. The script does its best to sink below vulgarity. [[Ed]] Gein, who killed only two middle-aged [[women]] and maybe his [[brother]], chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the Woodland of Weir, and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini, rather than period underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense.<br /><br />The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield. There is no body. The handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim, who may still be in the vicinity and living. The sheriff, lacking any motivation, shouts at him, ""Now you just FORGET that! I don't want you going off HALF COCKED on [[anything]]!"" It should be no more than a business-like exchange of views.

Characters of diverse sorts listen to radio [[programs]] or records that play old jazzy pop songs -- Louis Armstrong's ""Ain't Misbehaving,"" for instance. This is -- what -- rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s?

Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs, that's all.<br /><br />Of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget, but it can be light years ahead of this butchery.

And it's not [[hard]] to see why, [[considering]] Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and [[Basilica]] which was a [[scaled]] model used.<br /><br />So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be [[correspondingly]] scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter.

While reading the book some [[years]] ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, [[that's]] what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.<br /><br />Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit.

I watched '[[Sabrina']] with the French soundtrack to see if Julia dubbed her own dialog. They used someone else.

It was a Dutch film about Belgium in World War 2. I would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than were the French or Norwegians. The most savage fighting of all came in the Balkans where Tito's communist partisans gave the Germans fits.<br /><br />I noted in another review that 'dbdumonteil' believed Julia Ormond to be an American instead of the actual British nationality. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression.<br /><br />After watching this film several times, it suddenly dawned on me how out of season, the film is. It is set on Junuary 16, 1944 when the American plane crashes in Belgian farm country. The trees look to be in mid-Fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green. There is not the smallest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium ever.<br /><br />The actual plot of the film was a mess. [[Where]] to begin? For anyone interested in World War 2 history, the film came across as farce. The reconnaissance plane [[used]] was a huge 4-engine converted bomber. Such aircraft did exist, but they [[would]] have [[required]] massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival. In [[reality]], smaller and swifter aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task. The vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane. The crew had no need of this information to complete their mission, while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat. Even given the premise of the film, the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books. They would have been on their way to Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of German troops at the crash site.<br /><br />The Daussois home, where 'Major Brice' took refuge was a farm where no one had the least interest in farming. Food would have been very scarce in Belgium at this time. The Germans would have required substantial quantities of locally-produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the American flier. There would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway.<br /><br />The plot twist where Henri Daussois turns in the American out of jealousy is pathetic. He would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live. He would have had to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition. The woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war.<br /><br />'Major Brice' was caught in civilian clothing toward the end of the film.

"[[A]] [[recent]] re-issue of the French crime film (original title '[[Du]] Rififi Chez [[les]] Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now [[comes]] in the [[US]] in a gorgeous new print from [[The]] Criterion Collection with [[improved]] subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American ([[born]] Julius Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was [[forced]] to [[make]] films in Europe because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well [[publicized]] in the US and did [[well]] in art houses. Later Dassin became a [[lot]] more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek [[actress]] and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popularized for [[Americans]] and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was [[even]] a [[big]] hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD [[includes]] a recent interview with Dassin. [[I]] did not previously realize that one of the [[main]] robbers, Cesar the Milanese, was played by Dassin, who stepped in when the original actor [[became]] unavailable. He's one of the most memorable [[characters]], a dandified Italian safe cracker who speaks no French.<[[br]] /><br />[[Although]] this classic has all the [[trappings]] of French [[film]] noir--the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, [[shiny]] black cars, men in suits, the nightclub [[scenes]], including a dramatically filmed and lit title song [[performed]] at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or [[mouth--I]] don't think it's as atmospheric or has [[quite]] as distinctive a style as Melville's films do. [[But]] [[there's]] the mesmerizing robbery, which still holds up today as a [[tour]] de force. It goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork [[among]] the robbers. [[Some]] nosy cops are efficiently [[dealt]] with. [[Things]] quickly go wrong after they [[go]] home and [[distribute]] the loot when one of the players [[gets]] sloppy and [[gives]] a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. [[Has]] there ever been a heist film whose perps [[lived]] happily ever after? <br /><br />It's the [[wordless]] heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and Dassin, an American [[director]] who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for that. [[He]] [[took]] a novel so conventional he was [[going]] to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.","[[some]] [[complete]] re-issue of the French crime film (original title '[[die]] Rififi Chez [[cent]] Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now [[is]] in the [[world]] in a gorgeous new print from [[the]] Criterion Collection with [[restored]] subtitles and some extras.

He's one of the most memorable [[people]], a dandified Italian safe cracker who speaks no French.<[[cf]] /><br />[[because]] this classic has all the [[usions]] of French [[films]] noir--the black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, [[sleek]] black cars, men in suits, the nightclub [[area]], including a dramatically filmed and lit title song [[seen]] at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or [[people]] don't think it's as atmospheric or has [[only]] as distinctive a style as Melville's films do. [[but]] [[is]] the mesmerizing robbery, which still holds up today as a [[tours]] de force. It goes like clockwork, with a fine sense of craft and teamwork [[beyond]] the robbers. [[the]] nosy cops are efficiently [[deal]] with. [[something]] quickly go wrong after they [[back]] home and [[collect]] the loot when one of the players [[takes]] sloppy and [[breaks]] a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. [[having]] there ever been a heist film whose perps [[hold]] happily ever after? <br /><br />It's the [[amazing]] heist sequence that guarantees this a special place, and Dassin, an American [[filmmaker]] who had an unusually varied and exotic career, deserves full credit for that. [[who]] [[brought]] a novel so conventional he was [[unwilling]] to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.",0.021949410438537598,0.02641284465789795,1,1,1,1226,"Failed"

"The 1973 musical [[version]] of LOST HORIZON is the most wonderful endearing and campy musical [[films]] of ALL [[TIME]].

[[A]] strange [[mixture]] of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. [[It]] has the distinction of being the ONLY [[anti]] war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /><br />[[This]] film was a critical and financial [[disappointment]] in the United States, but made a [[lot]] of money overseas. Only in America did it fail. Highly [[different]] and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves [[far]] better credit than it's [[given]]. [[As]] a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible [[adventure]] and both the 1937 [[Frank]] Capra film and this 1973 musical are [[faithful]] adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What [[I]] [[like]] about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The [[film]] has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. [[This]] is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a wonderful [[place]]. Songs like THE [[WORLD]] IS A CIRCLE, SHARE THE JOY and LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a [[happiness]] that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a [[slightly]] [[goofy]] place? The two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME [[TO]] YOU are the sensitive spots in the picture. There's a peacefulness and [[soft]] spoken quality in both these songs that is very [[much]] keeping with the philosophy of the story. [[Moreover]], THE THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is a [[good]] duet with a strong melody. It's a [[nice]] exchange of different types of perspective and who can [[fault]] with Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping, [[singing]] and dancing on tables? They're a wonderful team and the number is [[well]] staged. <br /><br />I always found it [[interesting]] in this story how the High Lama [[kidnaps]] someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the [[High]] Lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his [[view]] of [[mankind]] as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. [[If]] this film were to be remade today, it would be [[interesting]] to see more emphasis put on the [[leading]] character, RICHARD ONWAY'S conflict with what he [[left]] behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in Shangri-La.<br /><br />Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /><br />LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not?

When my husband and I go the [[cinema]], we [[come]] to be entertained  and ""Half Empty"" did just that and the film did so in a smart [[show]] that made me feel as if my [[coming]] to the movie theater was worth it. It is a funny, human, and surprising sometimes musical [[journey]] that cleverly entertains in its simplicity. I especially [[noted]] the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom. [[it]] is almost like an operetta. [[another]] particular scene reminded me of a scene in ""Phantom of the Opera"" when [[eight]] of the performers did not just, i.[[d]]., they sang against one another in a friendly retort. [[it]] am not a film maven but this film was more [[amazing]] than any other major studio film I have seen lately. It is [[extraordinary]], funny, entertaining and amusing. Completely enjoyable  which is what [[they]] expect from movies but rarely do they deliver [[from]] ""Half Empty.""",0.016636371612548828,0.019023597240447998,1,1,1,511,"Failed"

"This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire (active volcanoes) and also along the edges of plate tectonics, whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis (a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave). Naturally, this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture, what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and more recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world.<br /><br />But I'll have to say this: The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier, look [[like]] classics. [[This]] disaster movie IS a [[disaster]], and a massive one at that. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the [[movie]] doesn't engage, and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime.<br /><br />The special effects are gorgeous to look at. From satellite styled outer space pictures, to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain [[bores]].<br /><br />If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with [[nary]] an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's [[akin]] to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.<br /><br />Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.<br /><br />If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.<br /><br />Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.","This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu.

"Normally i would applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this movie is some sort of parody on ninja movies.

Look at the characters from parodies like ""Hot Shots"" or ""Scary Movie"". Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never fall out of character! And because of this, certain scenes become funny and hilarious. In ""Red Shadow"" the actors never achieve that. The shadow ninja's supposed to be very skilled and deadly.

"Famous and mysterious recluse Raymar, who's some kind of lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, abruptly dies under bizarre circumstances. Nice girl high school student Julie Wells (a warm and sympathetic performance by the lovely Meg Tilly) wants desperately to be accepted by the snobby clique the Sisters (played to sublimely bitchy perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the ever-cuddly Elizabeth Daily), so she agrees to spend a night in a creepy mausoleum where Raymar's body has been interred as part of an initiation rite. Naturally, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's going to be a very long and harrowing night of pure nerve-wracking terror for poor Julie.<br /><br />Director/co-screenwriter Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the enjoyably tongue-in-cheek ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"") eschews graphic gore in favor of creating a brooding and eerie atmosphere, but fails to pull this particular feat off because the first hour is way too slow, talky and uneventful to be remotely scary or suspenseful. However, I nonetheless still found this flawed fright flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining. The big poofy hairdos, a goofy music montage sequence, badly timed false scares (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), a scene at a glittery video game arcade, kids gleefully smoking pot, and the hilariously dumb teen slang (""nerdle brain""!?) give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm. Hal Trussell's handsome, polished cinematography (I especially dug the smoothly gliding Steadicam tracking shots), Bob Summers' spooky, yet funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's splendidly ghoulish make-up f/x are all up to snuff. The ever-stolid Adam West of TV's ""Batman"" fame merely takes up space in a nothing secondary part. The mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location. The grand finale with a bunch of ghastly rotting corpses popping out of their coffins and floating about qualifies as a [[marvelously]] macabre shock set piece. Sure, this baby definitely ain't some unjustly unsung gem, but it still delivers plenty of [[pleasingly]] silly and diverting cheesy fun all the same.","Famous and mysterious recluse Raymar, who's some kind of lethal telekinetic psychic vampire, abruptly dies under bizarre circumstances. Nice girl high school student Julie Wells (a warm and sympathetic performance by the lovely Meg Tilly) wants desperately to be accepted by the snobby clique the Sisters (played to sublimely bitchy perfection by Leslie Speights, Robin Evans and the ever-cuddly Elizabeth Daily), so she agrees to spend a night in a creepy mausoleum where Raymar's body has been interred as part of an initiation rite. Naturally, Raymar still has his extraordinary powers, so it's going to be a very long and harrowing night of pure nerve-wracking terror for poor Julie.<br /><br />Director/co-screenwriter Tom McLoughlin (who later gave us the enjoyably tongue-in-cheek ""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"") eschews graphic gore in favor of creating a brooding and eerie atmosphere, but fails to pull this particular feat off because the first hour is way too slow, talky and uneventful to be remotely scary or suspenseful. However, I nonetheless still found this flawed fright flick to be oddly appealing and entertaining. The big poofy hairdos, a goofy music montage sequence, badly timed false scares (including the ubiquitous hand on the shoulder gag!), a scene at a glittery video game arcade, kids gleefully smoking pot, and the hilariously dumb teen slang (""nerdle brain""!?) give this picture a certain endearingly quaint 80's period charm. Hal Trussell's handsome, polished cinematography (I especially dug the smoothly gliding Steadicam tracking shots), Bob Summers' spooky, yet funky hum'n'shiver synthesizer score, and Tom Burman's splendidly ghoulish make-up f/x are all up to snuff. The ever-stolid Adam West of TV's ""Batman"" fame merely takes up space in a nothing secondary part. The mausoleum makes for an impressively vast and unsettling main location. The grand finale with a bunch of ghastly rotting corpses popping out of their coffins and floating about qualifies as a [[mildly]] macabre shock set piece.

I found the loud musical cues a [[bunch]] annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. I don't think these tricks are necessarily needed, but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. A minor diversion for this film's plot [[involving]] moving and the camera [[following]] the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them.

"Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other?<br /><br />Contrary to what others say, there IS an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.<br /><br />It's funny reading comments here about how miserable Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this film, because Montgomery's role is as much of a heel. He manhandles Ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. Ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what he did in Paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet. ""I forgave you that!"" she says, as if it was big of her.<br /><br />For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his ""mistress"" before tying the knot for good. For Ann, it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life.<br /><br />The acorn doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what David tried to pull: ""Oh my poor baby! Thank Heaven your father is dead!""<br /><br />That's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable comedy.<br /><br />You can call this an example of the ""remarriage comedy"", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the ""idiot plot"", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight American morality, but can't really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing.<br /><br />Lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. What a shame it couldn't have been something better! She was overbearing in ""My Man Godfrey"", too, but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her, you wanted to. Here she plays for laughs that aren't there while sadistically breaking David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like Groucho, a study in smugitude.<br /><br />The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer, who makes a play for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond underplays his many reaction shots, and even a drunk scene, all to good effect.<br /><br />***SPOILER***So decent a guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she goads him into a confrontation, calling Custer ""a lump of jelly"".

"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught [[everyone's]] attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his [[desolate]] Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This movie [[absolutely]] feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get [[behind]] him and follow along, or you get left behind. [[The]] pacing is a challenge: slow, but never [[without]] emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems [[loaded]] with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.<br /><br />We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in [[terms]] of the movies: one of the century's [[great]] writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the [[greatest]] actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling [[almost]] ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th [[Symphony]]. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to [[inspire]] Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main [[character]], Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even [[making]] [[Bogarde]] up to [[LOOK]] like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, [[delivers]] what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />","Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement.

[[these]] who feel that this is like a TV play are not [[even]] [[sorry]] but while Andrea Newman was to become famous for [[successful]] [[tv]] drama, this film is more in the tradition of the 'kitchen-sink'films such as 'Saturday Night And Sunday Morning' but with an [[concentrate]] on middle-class rather than working-class life. Rod Steiger is [[notable]] as the middle-aged angst-ridden lead, unhappily married to a repressed and [[rather]] barren [[woman]] ([[claire]] Bloom). The onset of the 'Technological [[revolutions]] is the the backdrop for the drama in which old values and certainties are challenged. [[these]] is the stage for the central character [[play]] by Judy [[strode]], a role which at the time was a shocking departure from the [[standard]] prim behaviour of contemporary heroines. [[any]] reversal of [[role]], with the girl rating her conquests in a little-black-book was a precursor to the [[feminism]] movement and was criticised at the time for promoting promiscuity [[like]] young girls. [[another]] irony of these criticisms is to be [[disappointed]] in both [[claire]] Bloom's and Peggy Ashcroft's characters who are both [[utterly]] dissatisfied. Peter [[hall]] made few films and on this evidence that is a great shame.

It is based upon medical technology which currently exists for fetal growth outside the womb. It could be a possibility tomorrow or today,"" according to Dr. Charles M. Brinkman III. Right. And, Dr. Joyce Brothers appears, later, at a party with Roddy [[grant]].<br /><br />First, we see Rock Hudson (as Dr. Paul Holliston) light a [[cigarettes]] and drive recklessly (watch that speedometer!) during a storm; unfortunately, he hits a dog. Mr. Hudson takes the wounded canine home. He learns it is pregnant, and manages to save the life of one of the puppies, due to his experimental knowledge of fetal growth. What this really boils down to is that Hudson uses an experimental drug to grow the embryo, so that it can survive outside the mother's womb. The dog, ""Number One"", grows to adult-size rapidly, and is passed off as its mother.<br /><br />Hudson lives with his sister-in-law Diane Ladd (as Martha Douglas); since his wife Nicole, also a doctor, died in another car accident. Ms. Ladd seems more emotionally stable about Nicole's death than Hudson, who survived the crash that killed his wife. Things begin to get creepy when Hudson's dog shows an intelligence level far above any normal dog. Then, Hudson decides to use his accelerated embryo growth on a human, Barbara Carrera (as Victoria Spencer).<br /><br />Hudson and the cast try their best; but, the ""Embryo"" storyline is [[not]] absurd nonsense. If you take away her silly opening and closing scenes, Ms. Carrera's valiant characterization almost works; she might have been a bigger star, if offered better films than this.

"The only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb.

Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to the next. Seemingly simple and docile, suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. Ms. Lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along.

You could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor.

"After a couple years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart film, ""Two Against the World"", it [[unexpectedly]] showed up as a TCM offering under the title ""One Fatal Hour"", a First National film from 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners. The owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on Scott.<br /><br />In an effort to boost the audience base and revenues, Reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old [[murder]] case, and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play. Scott enlists the [[aid]] of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it on the air.<br /><br />The Pembroke Murder case involved a woman who was acquitted of murdering her husband, the circumstances of which are not made clear. However Gloria Pembroke has married, and is now living as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to be married (on the same [[day]] no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). About to be [[faced]] with the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped. Simultaneously, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that the marriage not take place.<br /><br />Without revealing the final outcome, the film [[takes]] a devastating turn to jolt the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the principals of the radio station, vigorously admonishing Scott and the sniveling Reynolds. While accepting his share of the blame for the outcome, Scott partially redeems himself by quitting his job, firing his secretary, and hauling her out of the office, [[recognizing]] her for the conscience he once had. With an entirely abrupt finish, the film [[leaves]] one as disoriented and unsettled as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. <br /><br />With about a dozen films under his belt, Humphrey Bogart gets a chance to take center stage here with [[intriguing]] results. With no name supporting players, Bogey rises to the occasion by taking charge in the confines of the radio offices, and runs the show as if it was his own. In an interesting bit of characterization, he expresses his exasperation by crossing his hands over his bowed head, predating by a half dozen years a similar effect we'll see him do in ""Casablanca"".

"I've always been [[fascinated]] by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go further than beyond. In ""Ninja III"", it's fun creepy and [[intriguing]]. A ninja gets shot up by the police, and uses his spirit for revenge. The victim, a lovely young woman named Christie(Lucinda Dickey). She falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting. The love scene where she pours the V8 on her body knocked me out! The ninja's death gets the attention of another in Japan named Yamada(Sho Kosugi) he comes to America not only to save Christie, but to put the ninja back to the grave. Simply because he put out Yamada's left eye with a shuriken(throwing star). The fight scenes were excellent. I liked the part when the plywood falls on Yamada, and he splits it with his foot. And when he was caught, he tells the officer Christie was involved with that everything will be fine. Rule of thumb: Never under estimate a ninja. He took out the other cops without killing them. And he did his thing without worry. Of course, Chirstie did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge. It was a [[good]] movie, [[great]] for martial arts buffs. 3 out of 5 stars!","I've always been [[intrigued]] by ninjistsu, who would know that it will go further than beyond.

"On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once. We don't yet know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. On the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year. ""Here we can tell just when to drink the New Year in,"" exclaims Holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.<br /><br />To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He'd once had a friend name George, ""a merry fellow"" who was ""smarter than the rest of us."" On one New Year's Eve several years ago, George has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing Death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. ""And, gentlemen, George died last New Year's Eve!"" concludes Holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.<br /><br />As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. As the man's transparent [[spirit]] rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the [[distant]] approach of a phantom carriage. The driver, a frail [[cloaked]] figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches. We are [[astonished]] to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.<br /><br />Considering the era in which 'Körkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are [[absolutely]] [[superb]]. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the [[eerie]], ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective.

Another scene, eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining,' involves Holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.<br /><br />Genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, Victor Sjöström's 'Körkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.","On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once.

"When The Spirits Within was released, all you heard from Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like Final Fantasy. This is a different story, for better or worse. The familiar settings, characters, music, story, and over the top action scenes should thrill fans of the original game. The problem is that it just isn't a good movie in its own right.<br /><br />The direction during the fight scenes is often sloppy, switching camera angles ridiculously fast in an attempt to make the action seem more frenetic, but only serving to make the scenes look jumbled and confusing.<br /><br />The CG itself is exceptional, but I can't say it's the best I've ever seen since Spirits Within had much more detail on the characters, although I must admit that Advent Children's characters moved much more naturally.<br /><br />The plot is virtually a black hole. It's a giant deus ex machina designed solely to bring Sephiroth back for one last fight. Old characters reappear, but serve no real purpose other than to please fans. Character development is nonexistent and the film does nothing at all to resolve any of the plot threads left hanging after the game's end. But it's packed with neat-looking fight scenes with magic, summons, and limit breaks, which is probably what fans wanted anyway.<br /><br />In the end, Advent Children is a very flashy, but totally [[brainless]] action flick that serves more as a side story for Final Fantasy VII than a real sequel.<br /><br />By the way, don't think you're hurting my feelings by voting Not Useful.

And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. Also I like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out.<br /><br />On the downside, I don't understand how the Gentlemen are choosing their victims. They just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I've never liked him, but from ""Hush"" on I'm pretty much just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped.

"THE [[FALCON]] [[AND]] THE SNOWMAN is a [[superb]] example of an [[anti-80s]] film. While many other films of the decade in [[general]] [[lacked]] substance, this film is pure substance. There's [[nothing]] stylish or fake or [[superfluous]] about it. It boasts two superb performances: [[Timothy]] Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and [[Daulton]] Lee, [[respectively]]. Hutton, Penn, and Tom Cruise were a [[triumvirate]] of early 80s actors who all looked [[headed]] to [[much]] bigger and better things (all [[3]] starred in TAPS). [[While]] Penn and Cruise's popularity [[soared]], [[Hutton]] has been largely forgotten about, and that's a shame. [[Actually]], [[Hutton]] is the first of the 3 to [[win]] an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY [[PEOPLE]] in 1980, but I think his performance in this movie is [[even]] more outstanding.<br /><br />[[Hutton]] really captures the [[post-Vietnam]] war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce. [[A]] failed seminary school student, Chris has a [[love-hate]] relationship with his father, well played by the great character actor Pat [[Hingle]]. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his [[father]] thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one.<br /><br />[[Chris]] gets job at [[Dept]]. of Defense and uses his hatred of U.[[S]]. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of [[old]] projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy Daulton, a hyper drug-dealing [[self-server]], in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. [[While]] [[Chris]] is doing it [[based]] on his beliefs, Daulton is doing it [[strictly]] for the money. The Soviet liaison is [[excellently]] [[played]] by David Suchet. [[Penn]] and Suchet have a [[real]] quirky chemistry and it's a [[kind]] of funny [[set]] of exchanges between them. But, make no [[mistake]], this film is anything but that.

"[[It's]] now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. I haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. Now that [[I'm]] an adult in my 30s I can look [[back]] with a serious eye as I watch the episodes again.<br /><br />[[In]] concept, the cartoon is [[partly]] an homage to the [[classic]] Looney [[Tunes]] but [[also]] its own original show. There are a few [[episodes]] that are structured like the old cartoons. For [[example]], there is a singer that attacks Buster and so he exacts revenge on this singer's [[concert]] -[[exactly]] like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon. [[The]] ensuing [[cartoon]] is [[similar]] to Looney Tunes, just in a different era. [[If]] you [[look]] at the old Looney Tunes, they did an awful [[lot]] of stuff exactly [[like]] Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes [[made]] a lot of [[social]] commentary and parody. There were celebrity impersonations. [[There]] were a lot of corny period jokes, [[slang]], and dialog. [[The]] comedy was surreal and wacky. [[You]] can say this exactly for [[Tiny]] Toons as [[well]]. The comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most [[definitely]] a throwback to the classics which hadn't been [[done]] well (if at all) in cartoons in the [[decades]] prior to this show. We [[recognize]] the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. [[But]] the [[reason]] we don't [[think]] Looney Tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. Also, Looney Tunes was original back in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. So it's easy to perceive Tiny Toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.<br /><br />There certainly are differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being made for kids watching TV. Even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags AND [[still]] paying homage to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old Looney Tunes.<br /><br />Since Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of [[great]] animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.","[[maybe]] now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired.

"In the aftermath of September 11th in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. Of course, in the present day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known.

After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which [[makes]] no [[sense]] given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.<br /><br />When Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her character spends most her time throwing temper tantrums. Alex's dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.<br /><br />Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so ridiculous that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.<br /><br />I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"". This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though.

By the time a sinister Vladimir Putin lookalike Priest (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off, which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol, and him shouting ""You bastaaaard!"" at his friend's murdered corpse, and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs. [[still]] the climactic boat chase impresses. It's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no [[mention]] in this movie. Such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had [[forgotten]] to do with that sequence! Thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and warehouse shootout.<br /><br />Unless such a wretched thing as a Geoffrey Reeve completist [[existed]] - and you're one of them - [[it]] wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense.",0.03103041648864746,0.5155850052833557,0,1,0,407,"Successful"
"Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit.

Scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes.

"I caught this during a brief run in a Philadelphia theater. Despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come down hard on this movie. The director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film [[guerilla-style]], with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. Such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is [[utterly]] [[inappropriate]] for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. A stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama.

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.","If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd.

"What You Need In the run up to 'What You Need', every episode since 'The Lonely' had been a winner to some extent. This episode is the first major [[failure]] since 'Escape Clause'. The Serling script is again based on someone else's materiel, a short story by Lewis Padgett. As with 'And When the Sky Was Opened', Serling altered the content significantly, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler.<br /><br />'What You Need' works best when it is being sweet. The opening half, in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted. Sadly, the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes. The minute Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart. Cochran's part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw. His exploitation of the old peddler is [[dull]] and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing, making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false. Ernest Truex is good as the peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he's not good enough to help the floundering script.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. For instance, we learn that the peddler's power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future. So how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses. That seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power. Also, for a man who can see the future, the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat. There are many more holes that can be picked in 'What You Need' but it's [[hardly]] worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway.","What You Need In the run up to 'What You Need', every episode since 'The Lonely' had been a winner to some extent. This episode is the first major [[exception]] since 'Escape Clause'. The Serling script is again based on someone else's materiel, a short story by Lewis Padgett. As with 'And When the Sky Was Opened', Serling altered the content significantly, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler.<br /><br />'What You Need' works best when it is being sweet. The opening half, in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted. Sadly, the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes. The minute Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart. Cochran's part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw. His exploitation of the old peddler is [[abrupt]] and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing, making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false. Ernest Truex is good as the peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he's not good enough to help the floundering script.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies.

"Although my exposure to world cultures is limited, I do try. This was a film that I tried and [[hated]]. Worst of all, after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, I saw characters too outrageous for ""Eastenders"" being paraded as realistic.<br /><br />Clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter. Aim high, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offers to hire Clint if he gets a pair of shoes.<br /><br />Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wander the whole of England trying to get him some shoes. Eventually, they end up at a suburban home. Whose isn't clear. Mum helps a girl shoot up. Oh, now THERE'S some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha tie off and find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis tunes and then chases the kids away.<br /><br />Why didn't Clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store? Why didn't he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help? Why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? I just don't know! None of these things seemed to be beneath him. Benevolent groups, like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have stores to help people. I know people who work there! If someone with no money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot covering.

The world, or at least the western part of it, simply isn't that cruel. In England, maybe it's from ""The Queen's Royal Charity"" rather than Goodwill, but people who need shoes do get them.<br /><br />Aside from the quest for shoes, there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action. Not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable, mind you. Despite checking the tape jacket several times, I was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it only seemed that way.<br /><br />Did Clint get his shoes? Did the cardboard cutout of Brad Dourif hire him at the restaurant? Did I ever watch anything else foreign ever again?<br /><br />[spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />As for the fate of this particular film, I decided to end it all. I took out my S&W .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store, and amazingly NO ONE EVER CALLED TO ASK ABOUT IT!!! Meaning, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something that I didn't.

"There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it.<br /><br />But. They did it subtly.

"This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as ""The Deer Hunter."") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being ""the perfect wife"" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is [[amazing]]. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, ""I'm going to bust that marriage up!"" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps.

I am not [[going]] to [[give]] plot lines away as some reviewers have done, nor am I [[going]] to tell you the catch phrases (although there is really only one) but I will [[try]] to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film! Leaving the [[cinema]] on Monday night [[I]] could only imagine writing 'Oh my god, it's [[brilliant]], its amazing, its the best thing they have [[ever]] done, better than the first, second and specials all rolled into one!' Of course [[I]] owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So, why is it brilliant? This is a film for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema! You don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film; it works on so many levels.<br /><br />This film reminded me why I am a League of Gentlemen Fan! You can tell that filming was a true labour of love too; the attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show were always detailed but I am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background! The story moves at a swift pace, the action carrying us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the 'Creators' who are of course the League themselves! Along the way we manage to bump into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the TV sketch show.<br /><br />I was glad that the film was dark in places, a little scary and a little strange...only fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The Gents also managed to get their revenge on the BBC censors, not as much slipping in the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! Some may think the Gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry, the in jokes I mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but I shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since...well, I can't remember! The fans that have been 'with' the League since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the Local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, Simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise! I was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the film when I first heard about it but as a story within a story I was just getting into it when...but that would be telling! All I need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film! I am not a professional reviewer of films, so I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed this film but for now I will just say that if the supposed benchmark for British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of the Dead' then I am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary...The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse.<br /><br />Jason Kenny 2005","I have to admit that when [[you]] [[especially]] heard about the Apocalypse film it was a [[genius]].<[[zu]] /><br />I mean, they have a [[bit]] to live up to, don't they?

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.<br /><br />The original Robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those films that just can't be done again. That said, it's not surprising a sequel was made- it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has crafted an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and overlong film that can't capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it tries. And it certainly does that, the funny ads from the first film running none stop, the corporate satire aiming to be that bit sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before, but with blood/gore even meaner than the first film. The first film earned a name for some nasty, blood-soaked violence (including a man's genitals being blown off and a man being blasted to pieces) but while that was more memorable the violence/gore on display here is of a more sadistic and gratuitous nature, with a very unpleasant and mean-spirited tone to it.<br /><br />But overall, the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy- why are you watching this when you could be watching the original again instead? **","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke.

It is family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedic moments. The characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. The show holds the attention.

Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. This in itself is annoying. What really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it's got, on DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible.

If you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted DVD and end up with an unresolved plot issue  it makes me very angry!! I enjoyed ""Surface"" immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable  and we'll never know what happened next. I believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such DVD issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished.

"Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, getting back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization. He's sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a [[meaningless]] string of action sequences, most of which aren't [[even]] well choreographed.<br /><br />Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<br /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.","Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction.

That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.",0.02624613046646118,0.6563764810562134,0,1,0,585,"Successful"

"[[You]] don't review James [[Bond]] movies, you evaluate them, [[rate]] them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain [[things]] one has [[come]] to expect, even demand of a Bond [[film]] and each [[individual]] effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten [[elements]] that [[make]] a Bond film a Bond film. [[And]] even [[though]] [[NEVER]] [[SAY]] NEVER AGAIN is not technically [[part]] of the official Bond filmography, the mere [[presence]] of Sean Connery returning as 007 [[makes]] it [[something]] more than [[merely]] an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />[[Title]]: [[NEVER]] SAY NEVER AGAIN: [[The]] clever title has no apparent link to the [[actual]] storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's [[vow]] to never play OO7 again after having been lured [[back]] once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the [[case]], it is a [[catchy]] title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps [[trying]] to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a [[perfectly]] pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's [[best]], and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.<br /><br />Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.","[[you]] don't review James [[bond]] movies, you evaluate them, [[screen]] them according to how well they meet expectations.

"As the above suggests, I was ultimately [[unimpressed]] with this movie. It is lovely to look at, the scenery is lush, but the detail of the story, in particular the characters, are totally unbelievable. Films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. <br /><br />Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is frankly [[rubbish]] as Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent IS his performance, and we end up with a caricature of Irishness with no personality outside of his nationality. I find it totally implausible that anyone involved thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest over quality and when you're trying to be The Mission, this kind of thing wrecks your chances of success.<br /><br />Speaking of accents, there were a couple more problems, one being the striking modernity of Boy's accent which acted to dispel the feeling of being transported to another time. More surprising was Samantha Morton's much lauded Irish accent, which was variable to say the least. Her voice meandered between strong north and soft south, even in the voice-overs, where I would've expected any such discrepancies to be picked up.<br /><br />However, these are minor gripes compared to the motivation and actions of Sarah. She never seems at home with the English, and almost instantly at home with her son and his tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she if offered just seems like a no-brainer. Perhaps a lot has been lost in editing, perhaps this was meant to be a three hour film or a mini series where these things could've been fleshed out, but I can only judge what I've seen.<br /><br />Now the biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that her affection for him is not conveyed in any way until her having to choose between him and her son, the conflict she goes through at this point was frankly ridiculous and killed the movie for me. <br /><br />As you may have guessed. this movie didn't work at all for me, but it is top notch to look at, you really won't see anything more stunning in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.","As the above suggests, I was ultimately [[impressed]] with this movie.

His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man.<br /><br />9/10.",0.019674956798553467,0.023837685585021973,1,1,1,1315,"Failed"

"Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures battling Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format. First we have Showshine picked up off the street and brought to a science experiment lab where Simon Bar Sinister works. He fights back when Sinister tries to inject him with a chemical and accident occurs, he gets superpowers and the lab blows up wounding Sinister. On the street Shoeshine runs afoul of Riff Raff, another dog and gets picked up by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will once again battle Sinister.<br /><br />Once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. For me the film half works and half doesn't. The part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see Shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. Some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. Its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. Its painfully [[dull]] and feels like it takes forever to get through it, which considering the film is say 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.<br /><br />The parts that are good are anything with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is a blast) and anything where Underdog goes into action. Some how somewhere they managed to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. Of course I could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but I think not, since I do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.<br /><br />As a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an [[okay]] cartoon to film adaption.

"This film looks great, and that's about where my praise ends. ""Love Is a Many Splendored Thing"" came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like ""Kiss Me Deadly."" As a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""Marty"" established itself in the mid-50's, other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging, pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and ""Love"" is one of the latter.<br /><br />This is the kind of 50's movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime, and I certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill, ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anybody could have played these parts. Jones' role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something, the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.<br /><br />People will undoubtedly tell me I'm taking this film too seriously, that I'm unromantic, etc. But I loved ""All That Heaven Allows,"" released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas Henry King (director of ""Love"") is not.<br /><br />I'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I was just [[bored]].<br /><br />Grade: D+","This film looks great, and that's about where my praise ends.

"For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved into the then-present. One of the results is ""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon,"" starring a top Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne.

Once the man reaches England, however, his troubles are just [[beginning]].

"One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place. An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women. I believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations, separations and misunderstandings, and still being able to bond and rely on each other. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed ""dead"" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family, each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is, killing her husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts, but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends/family members perform.<br /><br />Another idea that I thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural. The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is to say, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the ""unfinished business."" I believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith (predominantly Catholic) as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality. The belief they held in regards to the dead being ""alive"" was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all, it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play. She's treated as if she still is a ghost (i.e. hiding in small crevices (underneath the bed or inside a car trunk)). I believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-held belief in life after death.","One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place.

"POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'<br /><br />work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes. <br /><br />I would, however, disagree with the reviews I've read complaining that the end feels ""tacked on."" I think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the progression of events, I felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. I've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two, and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. However, these flaws appear throughout, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.<br /><br />To his credit Davies is totally unafraid to write big, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric in the lead. For me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true. <br /><br />So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be uplifted or, at least, distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through CNN or the newspapers -- if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.","POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing.

The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric in the lead. For me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true. <br /><br />So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be uplifted or, at least, distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through CNN or the newspapers -- if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.",0.9787243604660034,0.9787243604660034,1,1,0,1,"Skipped"

"FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy as the Ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's Communism but more to Hitlerian Fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come straight out of Mein Kampf rather than Marx. And, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries connive with the Russian Prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. He's a former US operative-turned-drifter,Jason Monk, who is enlisted by the British Government to see what the Russians are up to. As a corny sidebar, Swayze's character who is no Monk (!)has sired a Russian beauty Elena (played by the gorgeous Marta Kondova) on his previous missions to the former Commie state. Hardman Swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil Russians. But young unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the flick as his nubile, 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved Mother Russia.","FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia.

"(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct.<br /><br />(Comment) The movie was a little slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution is simply [[ridiculous]]. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future were silly looking. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:43, Rated PG-13)(4/10)","(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price.

"This is one of the [[best]] TV movies I have ever seen! The title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on, all TV movies are like that!<br /><br />The story is [[fantastic]]. It may seem ridiculous but it is based on an [[incredibly]] true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave who feels trapped in his marriage.

How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /><br />The acting is [[top]] [[notch]] for TV movies. Gary Cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming, smooth-talking sociopath who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious.

Teddi Siddall, who I believe is Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her part well especially when she cries about the ""death"" of her husband. Wendy Makkena adds a nice touch as Alyson's sister.

"This film is so [[bad]] it's hilarious. I watched Hell Ride half thinking it was a comedy, although I couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p*ss, or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent. I notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious! It's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads, then showing each other 'get out of jail free' cards that they've made! Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, where the hell is he meant to be from?!? Oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards! The guy who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role, maybe this is part of the joke, I don't know. Actually, the more I think about it the more I'm sure this film is a p*ss take. It's produced by Quentin Tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh. It is a total rip off of Tarantino's style, but just done really really badly. It is very amusing though, and I guess either way it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the Tarantino/Rodriguez style, or something that is very very unintentionally funny. Has to be seen to be believed.","This film is so [[ridiculous]] it's hilarious.

"If [[ever]] there was a film that can be [[considered]] a missed opportunity then that film is Galaxina.

Firstly, this is a comedy with no [[funny]] bits at all, or at the very [[least]] a film where the potentially amusing aspects are [[presented]] in an incredibly unamusing way.

What [[cannot]] [[yet]] be wrong in basing a sci-fi film [[within]] a sexy statuesque female android? [[knowing]] such a film could never be a complete waste of [[fun]]? Well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. There are a [[deal]] of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are [[one]] basic problems that entirely destroy the whole [[company]].

"This is a movie that will [[leave]] you thinking, is he or isn't he? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs. [[This]] is my interpretation and theory, and [[I]] [[believe]] it is very sound. <br /><br />First, here is the plot. One [[day]], Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the [[midst]] of a busy train station. [[After]] attempting to [[help]] a woman from muggers, he is arrested and [[sent]] to Bellevue, and later transferred to Dr. Mark [[Powell's]] (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot freely talks about how he [[came]] from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is [[classified]] as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. [[He]] [[befriends]] the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. [[In]] fact, he tells them he can take one person [[back]] with him. Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to [[question]] Prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is [[harder]] and harder to prove Prot wrong. <br /><br />In the end, [[Dr]]. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter, a [[smart]] [[man]] who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico, when his wife and [[daughter]] were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to [[leave]] for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth [[anniversary]] of the murders. The time comes and [[goes]], and Powell [[finds]] Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. [[One]] of the patients is missing and is never [[found]] again. <br /><br />On to my theory: Prot is not [[crazy]]. Prot is from the planet [[K-Pax]]. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. On one of [[Prot's]] previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, [[learning]] about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became [[best]] friends. [[After]] the death of his family, and Robert [[slaying]] the [[murderer]], Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he [[rushes]] back (in multiples of light speed) to stop [[Robert]]. So Prot [[takes]] over the thinking of [[Robert]], taking over his body so to [[speak]]. [[Awhile]] later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July [[27]], he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.","This is a movie that will [[be]] you thinking, is he or isn't he?

Prot claims that he plans to [[head]] for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth [[birthday]] of the murders. The time comes and [[went]], and Powell [[shoots]] Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. [[two]] of the patients is missing and is never [[mentioned]] again. <br /><br />On to my theory: Prot is not [[insane]]. Prot is from the planet [[hell]]. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot's. On one of [[countless]] previous visits to Earth, Robert was a child, [[running]] about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became [[bad]] friends. [[for]] the death of his family, and Robert [[murdering]] the [[man]], Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he [[goes]] back (in multiples of light speed) to stop [[robert]]. So Prot [[is]] over the thinking of [[robert]], taking over his body so to [[speaking]]. [[week]] later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July [[20th]], he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.",0.02753216028213501,0.5548890233039856,1,0,1,1218,"Successful"

"Okay, here's the deal. There's this American pilot who's flying along, minding his own business, when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil, cowardly non-American fighter planes (they're Middle Eastern types, but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley), who proceed to shoot him down. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong, but those evil non-Americans didn't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death!!<br /><br />Now, what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug, contented look about him. He'll make those Americans pay, oh yes indeed!<br /><br />But He didn't reckon on Doug Masters, the captured pilots 16-year-old son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car, (which can't be that long) and decides to fly into that evil, foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot Chappy' Sinclair, Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. <br /><br />Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail, but you'd be wrong. Sure, those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots, but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably, the evil, not quite so smug anymore, dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself, in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAH!<br /><br />After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90% of their air force, the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down, but in the nick of time, a flight of US F16s turn up and scare them away.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film enough. It was the first ever videocassette movie that I brought, and until I was twenty, I kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that I could rescue him. But he's doesn't like flying, so it didn't happen.","Okay, here's the deal.

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The [[whole]] boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much [[less]] interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob.

The [[old]] boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much [[simpler]] interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it [[does]] have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it [[may]] have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.",0.15259552001953125,0.5098052620887756,0,1,0,283,"Successful"

The father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons...

"Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so [[slow]] and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot, sunny day, I might add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is.<br /><br />Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both [[cheap]] and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts [[groaning]] in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it [[hard]] to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like [[I'd]] just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite. All that watching Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past, for nothing?. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, however crazy/stupid you might think it. If you don't watch a lot of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat, but I found this slow, [[boring]] and highly derivative.

"With Nurse Betty (2000), [[acclaimed]] indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet [[remains]] true to his roots. While his cast is now composed of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains just as bizarre and [[quirky]] as his first two features, proving that he just may be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its moderate box office and critical success, perhaps [[moviegoers]] weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. The [[story]] follows (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg [[Kinnear]]) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues. Fans of LaBute's previous work might have a hard time [[figuring]] out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of [[Men]] -- a [[tragicomedy]] about two cruel sexist pigs who play a [[practical]] [[joke]] on a deaf co-worker --, but when you [[think]] about it, the connection is rather [[clear]]: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being [[ruthlessly]] taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a joke. Some might [[begin]] to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. [[But]] [[personally]], I think he's coming to the defense of the fair sex and dealing far more harshly with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. [[One]] of the [[many]] charms of this [[film]] is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.<br /><br />Grade: A-","With Nurse Betty (2000), [[struggling]] indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as opposed to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet [[keeping]] true to his roots.

"I accidentally happened upon this movie when I was looking for something to watch while eating lunch. I actually turned to the WE Network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of ""sticking it"" for some gymnastics team -- I figured cheesy goodness. Well, I got cheesy alright. <br /><br />First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. Luckily, most of it was recapped fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist.<br /><br />I love Jenny Garth and will watch her in just about anything. She's just so pretty, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does. She looks great throughout this movie, and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade. <br /><br />Overall, I felt bad for the actors as I watched this movie. All of them tried to sell their parts, but all were so [[poorly]] written that it was a constant struggle.

I actually turned to the WE Network because it said it had the last 20 minutes of some movie about the importance of ""sticking it"" for some gymnastics team -- I figured cheesy goodness. Well, I got cheesy alright. <br /><br />First, I missed a good 20-40 minutes at the start of the movie. Luckily, most of it was recapped fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits that she felt responsible for the death of her rapist.<br /><br />I love Jenny Garth and will watch her in just about anything. She's just so pretty, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as hers always does. She looks great throughout this movie, and doesn't really age over what seems to be more than a decade. <br /><br />Overall, I felt bad for the actors as I watched this movie.

"There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene's. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course those were made with a bit of budget. All shown on 42nd in NY, but hey, there were other grindhouses out there that showed no budget roughies. Wet Wilderness is an example of it. It circuited the underground scene after a while so copies were available but as seen on other reviews, some copies were abrupt cut at the end. But the version I watched was complete. Well i would call this one more a porn one then a roughie, there is a serial killer around but he likes more to watch others have sex instead of killing them, when he kills it's done off screen. The acting is the [[worst]] I ever seen. And I guessed that the so called actors didn't like what they are doing, for example in the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watch one girl stop performing and pulls a pubic hair out of here mouth then continues doing what was happening, or when mother is riding the black man, the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by ants! But it is the storyline that made this one famous, incest and racism is what this made it famous. When there is blood watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act, god this is worse but still one to have if you are into sleaze and grindhouse. Be sure that you have the full version.","There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene's.

"I would not deny that I have quite enjoyed watching any Japanese horror films, but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The film follows the story of the Grudge. Audrey, as requested by her mom, is going to get her sister back. But when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. She wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, there's also something happening to a family and three girls, but they seem to realise it too late...<br /><br />In fact, I can't see the points for the three girls from international school to appear in the movies as they're not (quite) related to the story. The reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me they're just telling the same things I saw in the grudge). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd, which I suppose is an attempt to make the story about the family related. The killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the Ring and Shibuya kaidan. The acting would be another [[bad]] point. As a Hong Konger I would really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a film lover I really can't find any point to support bad acting. Other actors like the father , though he just appears in a few scenes, should also have done better. What is kept good is the atmosphere of the film, especially when I watched it in the middle of the night alone.<br /><br />If you have time, really enjoy any horror films and have seen all the possible horror films except this, like me, you can go for it to kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror films of this kind, you should spend some time watching the Japanese version of the Ring.","I would not deny that I have quite enjoyed watching any Japanese horror films, but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over.<br /><br />The film follows the story of the Grudge.

"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, ""Look at me, I am so pretty!"" As a hero, his character is a total [[wimp]]. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some [[kind]] that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, [[even]] though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that [[gets]] killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley [[blow]] up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. [[He]] really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. [[The]] scenes which take place in the 1900s [[lack]] any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters [[act]] like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie made the PAST [[seem]] like the real base of the characters. [[This]] new version [[lacks]] substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then [[fails]] to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make [[sense]] that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are [[never]] seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also [[silly]] is the giant pit full of water and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter.

"This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr [[Jarchovský]] is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its [[details]]. [[Taking]] its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a [[super-nice]] guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good [[angel]],/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas [[leads]] Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He [[introduces]] her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though [[Prague-born]], owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an [[ancient]] and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, [[even]] [[though]] he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to [[jail]].<br /><br />[[In]] the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to [[depend]] on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in.

"""Campfire Tales"" is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert.

"For a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to ""Rosemarys Baby"" is one big mistake. It starts off that Andrew/Adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is [[terrible]] as Andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and Dukes of Hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of Satan. In fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him. He finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the Son of Satan. His dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack!!! This scene is memorable and well worth a watch. The ending is [[terrible]] and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie.

"Meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously stylish ""Le Samourai (1968)."" I don't even think this is the best example of the much-loved heist subgenre. The main thing against the film is its long running time. Meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details. He could have told the same story in a relative short time, but for reasons that I don't understand, the film seems to go on and on. Still, the movie is [[never]] boring. Melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very ""cool"" master thief. The movie's must-see color photography is a great asset and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective manner. From a technical standpoint, the movie is practically flawless. At times, one gets the feeling that Meville is merely showing off, but when someone is as talented as he is, one has little reason to complain. I still like other heist movies a little bit more (Jules Dassin's ""Topkapi (1964),"" just to name one), but there is no [[denying]] that this film is a good piece of pulp entertainment and a good example of what people refer to as ""cool"" cinema.","Meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously stylish ""Le Samourai (1968).""

"Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player ""Jimmy"" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns along the way between these two, as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. She is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and in no position to care for him. Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie. You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly, and it does. This film is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing ""The Godfather."" The actors are good ones, needless to say, as they all would have futures ahead of them in film. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underrated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola's, and I confess I had never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience.","Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969.

Cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a sort of ""Folk Hero"" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was [[basically]] an amoral, self-serving thief.<br /><br />My primary [[problem]] with ""ODC"" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /><br />The film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. Writer Gerard Stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an Irish ""Lock Stock"" or a grittier treatment of Martin Cahill's thieving career? That's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /><br />It's also unfortunate that ""ODC"" followed the cinema release of John Boorman's ""The General"", which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.<br /><br />What IS surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a happy Hollywood-style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief Michael Lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in ""ODC"". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. <br /><br />The real Cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his ""Man of The People"" self-image. Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in ""ODC"" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.","""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"".

But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison.<br /><br />The film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context to the present, and vice versa.

"[[There]] were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on it - but [[The]] Red Circle is more than just [[another]] entry in an overpopulated genre and with this [[film]], director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to [[create]] [[something]] that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience [[something]] to think about. Being cool is just as [[important]] a [[feature]] of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and Melville [[delivers]] that with this [[film]] in droves; the tone of the [[film]] is very relaxed too and Melville allows the [[bulk]] of the film to bubble under the [[cool]] exterior. The story has a number of angles but the [[central]] character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His [[release]] [[coincides]] with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel, who slips from under the [[nose]] of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does upon release is [[steal]] some money from his former boss Rico, and the [[second]] thing he does is [[recruit]] Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. [[But]] [[Rico]] and the police are hot on the thieves' [[tails]]...<[[br]] /><br />The film is bolted together by four [[excellent]] central performances. Alain Delon is calm and [[calculating]] as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè [[looks]] [[formidable]] in his [[role]] as the escaped murderer. François Périer is good also as a [[dubious]] club owner, while the real standout performance [[comes]] from André Bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. The film [[runs]] at almost [[two]] and a half hours and is not [[exactly]] a thrill ride. However, the director [[keeps]] [[things]] interesting by keeping the action focused on the [[important]] elements. [[The]] film does [[feature]] crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are [[kept]] to a minimum. The first two thirds of the movie are [[really]] just [[building]] up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the [[end]]. Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which [[nobody]] speaks a word. The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. The film [[boils]] down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. Overall, this [[might]] not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but [[The]] Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.","[[all]] were heist movies before this one, and indeed the likes of Rififi were an obvious influence on it - but [[no]] Red Circle is more than just [[some]] entry in an overpopulated genre and with this [[movie]], director Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to [[make]] [[anything]] that both thrills on the surface and gives its audience [[nothing]] to think about. Being cool is just as [[prominent]] a [[role]] of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and Melville [[tries]] that with this [[movie]] in droves; the tone of the [[movie]] is very relaxed too and Melville allows the [[focus]] of the film to bubble under the [[beautiful]] exterior. The story has a number of angles but the [[real]] character is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His [[escape]] [[figures]] with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel, who slips from under the [[body]] of Police Commissioner Mattei during a train ride. The first thing Corey does upon release is [[ask]] some money from his former boss Rico, and the [[other]] thing he does is [[recruits]] Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him pull of a jewel heist. [[neither]] [[rico]] and the police are hot on the thieves' [[escape]]...<[[ct]] /><br />The film is bolted together by four [[main]] central performances. Alain Delon is calm and [[reserved]] as the film's anti-hero, while Gian Maria Volontè [[seems]] [[good]] in his [[appearance]] as the escaped murderer. François Périer is good also as a [[shady]] club owner, while the real standout performance [[suffers]] from André Bourvil in his role as the police commissioner. The film [[running]] at almost [[four]] and a half hours and is not [[even]] a thrill ride. However, the director [[ends]] [[being]] interesting by keeping the action focused on the [[main]] elements. [[a]] film does [[provide]] crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are [[stripped]] to a minimum. The first two thirds of the movie are [[simply]] just [[set]] up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the [[epilogue]]. Rififi was most famous for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which [[zero]] speaks a word. The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in direction and the calm and composed way that it plays out make good of it. The film [[comes]] down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off nicely. Overall, this [[fails]] not appeal to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but [[a]] Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.",0.018748760223388672,0.5020619630813599,1,0,1,957,"Successful"

"I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes are also [[delightful]], thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's foil. He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. Joining in the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use up most of the picture. Gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively Fields', though).

"The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure.<br /><[[br]] />Lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and [[gentle]] one moment and raging the next. The suspense [[comes]] from her various ploys to [[keep]] him happy while [[trying]] to escape. It's a nail-biter all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many [[fine]] ""soulful"" parts that she was so good at. Instead, it's a role [[many]] [[lesser]] actresses could have handled well enough. My [[favorite]] scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan's [[already]] having [[difficulty]] with his masculinity and what others are [[saying]] about him. [[Then]] when Whiting walks in and [[finds]] the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor, she starts [[getting]] coy, flirting with her [[budding]] sexuality. Sensing trouble, Ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit. Insulted, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work ""women's work"". That does it. [[Up]] to that point he's been courteous and professional with Lupino, [[trying]] to [[set]] himself on a normal path. But Whiting has hit his raw nerve. [[Now]] [[there's]] heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door, leaving Lupino to pay the price. It's a [[riveting]] scene, expertly done.<br /><br />Anyway, this is one of the [[dozen]] or so films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving [[away]] from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles. [[Too]] bad. [[What]] a [[hugely]] talented figure she was both behind the camera and in [[front]].

"Combining serious drama with adequate comedy is touchy at the best of times. LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD pulled it off thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention Albert Brooks' excellent broodish character portrayal. But MAN OF THE YEAR can't come close by comparison. It has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is completely unbelievable.<br /><br />The premise initially seemed very promising. Put a Jon Stewart-like comedy news guy up for President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is pressured into running by his audience.

She finds a glitch in the system that is quickly swept under the rug by the company's owner and his dark attorney Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to get to President-elect Dobbs and finally spill the beans (this is where the unbelievable love story starts blossoming, too).

However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she'd pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT.<br /><br />With regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing.

And then some!<br /><br />First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly [[terrible]] right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat.

In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.<br /><br />Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!<br /><br />The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.<br /><br />Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.","BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events.

Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.",0.029254496097564697,0.6667174100875854,0,1,0,580,"Successful"

"Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? Sigh). Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home, while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), however Jackie's better looking alter-ego starts to take control...<br /><br />Written, co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter [[crap]] from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was 'inspired' by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was/is intended to be a horror film, the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it, why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? Why, that's the question I ask here. It's not even good porn either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.","Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me?

"Barry Champlain is a radio phone-in talk-show [[host]] in Dallas, whose [[no-holds-barred]] ideas on a plethora of social issues [[disturb]] and offend [[many]] of his callers and listeners. Is Barry a [[media]] messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his [[audience]] ?<br /><br />This is an intense, provocative character [[piece]] about a man with almost no redeeming [[features]] who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. Though co-written and [[directed]] by Stone, this is really Bogosian's piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly [[hard-edged]] and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is at times one of the most [[loathsome]] characters imaginable, spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone [[around]] him, particularly those who care about him. [[But]] at the same time he is also strangely [[empathetic]], hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosian's hawkish features [[burn]] into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting [[around]] as if [[permanently]] seeking an answer to some riddle. The [[movie]] is [[essentially]] an angry, [[self-righteous]] rant against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the [[world]], culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-minute rotating single shot of Barry delivering the [[ultimate]] [[I-hate-everything]] speech, but boy does it pack a punch. [[The]] support [[cast]] are [[great]], particularly Greene as the ex-wife and Baldwin as the boss. Robert Richardson's keen photography [[manages]] to keep the [[single]] radio studio set looking interesting and there's a tense score by Stewart Copeland, with a moving coda [[featuring]] that endearing phone-music piece, Telephone And Rubber [[Band]] by [[The]] Penguin Cafe Orchestra.

Is Barry a [[dark]] messiah in search of truth, or a social misfit out to assault his [[cause]] ?<br /><br />This is an intense, provocative character [[tale]] about a man with almost no redeeming [[characteristics]] who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy. Though co-written and [[premiered]] by Stone, this is really Bogosian's piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly [[distinctive]] and penetrating performance from which there is no escape. Barry is at times one of the most [[compelling]] characters imaginable, spewing bilious misanthropy at everyone [[within]] him, particularly those who care about him. [[and]] at the same time he is also strangely [[thoughtful]], hypnotic, sage, even lovable. Bogosian's hawkish features [[add]] into the frame, with his green eyes constantly darting [[inside]] as if [[still]] seeking an answer to some riddle. The [[film]] is [[truly]] an angry, [[hilarious]] rant against all the bigotry, injustice and banality in the [[country]], culminating in a wild three-and-a-half-minute rotating single shot of Barry delivering the [[infamous]] [[final]] speech, but boy does it pack a punch.

"[[This]] production was [[quite]] [[well]] done for a television original, providing a very appropriate [[original]] slant on Swift's work. To make the [[frame]] story work [[well]] the film begins with Gulliver [[arriving]] home. [[Everyone]] who has read the book knows that will [[happen]] anyway. [[The]] frame story of the book has Gulliver's crazed confusion in [[sections]]. For example, he is horrified that he will trample little people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. [[But]] the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. When Gulliver [[narrates]] his travels the editing cuts from England to the travel are very [[effective]]. I confess I found them intrusive and [[irritating]] at first, then they became natural. By the [[end]], moreover, they have become a welcome addition to the [[story]]. As he tells his adventures to a [[larger]] and larger audience, more and more people [[listen]] to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. [[For]] example, his hatred of filthy Yahoos and [[admiration]] of pure logic from the fourth section comes [[across]] [[well]] when he is defending his own sanity. [[The]] intercuts between events in [[England]] and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. [[For]] example, ripping the cloth from the table to [[suggest]] the motion of towing a group of [[ships]] is inspired filming. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works [[well]]. Swift only hints at this by having the [[long-suffering]] wife protest against further voyages. It becomes a [[natural]] part of this story. [[The]] casting and acting were competent throughout. [[Some]] roles were [[exemplary]]. Omar Sharif's mad magician is [[superb]]. O'Toole's [[little]] emperor is [[doddering]] delightfully toward senility. Many specific complaints made by other [[writers]] here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. [[I]] [[read]] the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. [[I]] [[may]] have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. [[And]] I had to start it again as I began [[reading]] about this film. While the Danson version is superior to any [[previous]] film, it does not replace the book. [[However]], I think it will bring [[many]] readers to the book. If you have not [[read]] the book, [[enjoy]] this movie then go to the source. [[If]] you [[appreciate]] the satire in it, find Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" and his ""Drapier's Letters."" [[Both]] are satires attacking the wretched treatment of [[Ireland]] and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland. These were Wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's torturous experiences a chance.

"Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a [[disappointing]] only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin's 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'.

"Once upon a time, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister. At death's door, she requests, ""Send for David Holm!""

The great ""double exposure"" effect is used frequently, but never seems overdone; and, it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable (for example, Sjöström's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door).

It also introduces the lead female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks [[great]].<br /><br />When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - [[amazing]]!<br /><br />However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me.

Scott MacDonald does a [[terrible]] job as Jack Frost, you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain, you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup, Jack Frost 2 is a [[bad]] sequel that is better then the first. I do have one complaint, the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings, the mouth could have opened wider, but the CGI was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST, then you will like this sequel. No questions or debate, 9 BIG [[ones]].",0.020012378692626953,0.8257327079772949,1,0,1,175,"Successful"

"""[[It]] all depends on how you [[look]] at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell,"" [[says]] the priest [[Rev]]. Harlan in ""Northfork."" The Polish brothers' [[film]] is an ambitious [[one]] that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up, [[provided]] he or she has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The [[layers]] of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer [[beyond]] the surreal and [[absurd]] imagery that is obvious to a less [[obvious]] socio-political and theological commentary that ought to [[provoke]] a laid-back American to reflect on current [[social]] values. The film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who nearly ""crucify"" their feet to wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts, etc.) could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. Though European cinema has better credentials in this field, Hollywood has indeed made such films in the past in ""Cat Ballou"", Lee Marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap, several decades ago. ""Northfork,"" in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in ""Citizen Kane"" taking Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic.<br /><br />The film is difficult for the [[uninitiated]] or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue (one of the finest I can recall) can be heard as a [[voice]] over towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the [[finest]] moments to those who can stay with film to the end. If you have the patience you will savor the layers of the filmif you gulp or swallow what the Polish bothers dish out, you will miss out on its many flavors.<br /><br />What is the film all about? At the most obvious layer, a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric-project. Even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. Real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have Christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. Most are devout Christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called ""Flower Hercules."" While the filmmaker does give clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.<br /><br />At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.<br /><br />The final layer is the social commentary""The country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people."" Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.<br /><br />To the religious, the film says ""Pray and you shall receive"" (words of Fr Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). To the consumerist, the film says ""its what we do with our wings that separate us"" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).<br /><br />The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.","""[[its]] all depends on how you [[seem]] at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell,"" [[stated]] the priest [[bro]].

""Northfork,"" in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars, seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in ""Citizen Kane"" taking Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic.<br /><br />The film is difficult for the [[dramatic]] or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue (one of the finest I can recall) can be heard as a [[voices]] over towards the end of the credits. The directors seem to leave the [[last]] moments to those who can stay with film to the end. If you have the patience you will savor the layers of the filmif you gulp or swallow what the Polish bothers dish out, you will miss out on its many flavors.<br /><br />What is the film all about? At the most obvious layer, a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric-project. Even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds. Real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have Christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. Most are devout Christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a mother, finds one in an androgynous angel called ""Flower Hercules."" While the filmmaker does give clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.<br /><br />At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.<br /><br />The final layer is the social commentary""The country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people."" Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.<br /><br />To the religious, the film says ""Pray and you shall receive"" (words of Fr Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). To the consumerist, the film says ""its what we do with our wings that separate us"" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).<br /><br />The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.",0.052753746509552,0.5247694253921509,1,0,1,637,"Successful"

"Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in a Pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to obtain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eve Merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the reds decide she must be liquidated and Cvetic must aid her without endangering himself. The film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but (by today's [[standards]]) very cheesy propaganda and [[little]] action or thrills. Lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless. Few surprises here and how did this film receive a Oscar nod for best documentary?

"Not being a particular fan of westerns, I watched this primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Lucy Show"" type of role. Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a saloon in the Arizona Territory in 1868 who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger.) Ball's performance was [[OK]] - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (A typical funny line - ""there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!"") I didn't find the story all that compelling, although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent. There's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. As to Christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. If you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. If you're not big on the genre, this will be lacking.

Some selection and editing is [[made]] but this script just didn't select or edit [[that]]. [[it]] didn't render Hoffman's [[lives]] down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the [[viewers]] could identify with and, through them, 'get' the [[big]] picture of the whole man.<br /><br />The [[film]] wanders from being a straight [[moving]] 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu/mocu-mentary (using [[live]] shots faked up to match archive footage), to [[making]] True Life Sob Stories [[films]] of the Week (the whole ""I'm bringing up a son who doesn't know I'm his [[boy]]"" shtick), to political conspiracy theory movie etc. etc. [[he]] just [[completely]] makes its mind up what it wants to be, and the half-hearted Citizen Kane like narrative [[technique]] (reporter interviewing people from Hoffman's past) is soon [[released]] which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it [[left]] out.<br /><br />The movie is full of [[scenes]] and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and [[will]] [[arguably]] have been cut to leave room to expand something more important.

"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. The writer/director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />Lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical ""last big night"" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go off to college. One thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There's a disposition of time, like in Nick Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. ""More American Graffiti"" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) off in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. Instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on New Years Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to become confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.<br /><br />The best parts of the movie to me are the ones with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. A good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. It was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why Curt isn't in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There's a black kind of satire to some of the Vietnam stuff, very similar to what I would imagine Lucas and John Milius' original idea for ""Apocalypse Now"" would have been like. And there's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. It just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and so many better films.<br /><br />Like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are great, and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see -- I wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? I couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I guess I have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as I remember it being. It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of ""American Graffiti"" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as ""American Graffiti"" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.","I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. The writer/director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />Lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical ""last big night"" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go off to college. One thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There's a disposition of time, like in Nick Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. ""More American Graffiti"" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) off in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original.

For example, right after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, Beth is found being interviewed by the local media. The reporter mentions ""the shooter"" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, ""What do you think about guns in the hands of minors?"" or something to that effect.

"I tend to get [[furious]] when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a [[director]]. Too often he's categorized as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and [[disgust]] entire audiences with images of pure gore. [[True]], his [[films]] contain more explicit filth and sickness as your [[average]] mainstream American production, but his films [[always]] are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely [[morbid]]. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another [[story]]! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I [[easily]] [[dare]] to call this film a masterpieceit's an old-fashioned giallo that [[includes]] all brilliant aspects of genuine horror. The film [[shows]] the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a [[small]] Italian mountain-town. [[The]] bodies of 3 young boys are found, horribly mutilated. [[There]] are quite a [[lot]] of pseudo-madmen in the town but every trail leads to [[nowhere]]. Among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary [[woman]], obsessed by witchery and voodoo. [[Like]] a [[true]] mastermind, Fulci knows to [[find]] the right creepy tone for his film. [[He]] [[portrays]] the [[small]] town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre [[happenings]], supported by a giddy soundtrack. Fulci also [[develops]] himself as a genius storyteller here. The script [[always]] is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will [[mislead]] you more than once. In other words, this is a unique [[giallo]] (horror slash murder mystery). The gore isn't [[presented]] as grotesque and [[explicit]] as in Lucio's later milestones (among them are the [[legendary]] Zombie 2, [[The]] Beyond and the New York Ripper), [[although]] there still are a few nauseating and hard-to-watch shock-sequences shown. <br /><br />Don't [[torture]] a Duckling is the most compelling and [[effective]] achievement Lucio Fulci ever brought forward and it [[easily]] ranks [[among]] the greatest Italian horror movies ever made. [[Right]] [[next]] to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and [[Dario]] [[Argento]].

All is well, until David receives some negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed.

If this sounds like your idea of a good film, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store.<br /><br />This tries to copy the original film's dark and voyeuristic feel, but while it does a pretty good job of this, it still [[can't]] [[hold]] up to that of the original's.

"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.<br /><br />I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.<br /><br />Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an [[admirable]] successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />Characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying. Don't be put off by the appallingly low rating on IMDb, check it out for yourself.","Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic.

"So I caught this one afternoon as ""What Lies Above"" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising.

"I caught this on local Mexican television at 2:00 a.m. and I decided to give it a chance since it's based on a real life case that deals with the murder of the typical All American family (a dad, a mom, and a young son).<br /><br />On the beginning the hints point to Walker to be the murderer as he had strong differences with his father. Shortly after, when Walker and Luke are taken to the Sheriff's dept. to being examined by the lies detection machine, things turn out to be very different...<br /><br />Also, when Walker and Luke attend to an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke would receive $200,000 and Walker is out of the heresy.

"A family of dirt-farmers moves out west.<br /><br />The head of Walnut Grove's newest motley brood is named 'Charles'.

They have two children, a boy, 'Willie', and a girl, 'Nellie', whom between them, have only one saving asset... Nellie is hot and it's fun to spy on her when she takes a bath in the crick.<br /><br />The town preacher is also the village [[idiot]] because he thinks he's really something special to this backwoods covey of country dillweeds, when in reality, they can't stand his boring sermons and the only thing they pray for on Sunday is for him to fall off the nearest cliff as soon as possible.<br /><br />The town doctor is a dinosaur who saw his better days about 20 years ago, but he hangs around anyway so he can give free breast examinations to the old hags that live in town. Unfortunately, the only time these ancient hot mamas get down on their knees is to pull a loaf of bread out of the oven to give to the Doc for his services. But that's OK with Doc because he knows these old wenches give good bread.<br /><br />Bringing up the rear of this colorful collection of country cow-chips is Charles' [[wimpy]] wife 'Carolyn' and their three girls, 'Mary', 'Carrie', and 'Half-Pint'. Mary is another hot chick who all the guys sneak a peek at whenever she takes a shower or a crap.

"The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time [[masterpiece]]. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here, but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. ""Scorpion"") and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (...), while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best.<br /><br />The film gets off to a [[great]] start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. That's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated, almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great, however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. There's a few surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second, but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. Overall, I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.","The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time [[mess]].

[[Here]] he [[meets]] George Hazard (James Read) who is supposed to be the hated [[enemy]], the Yankee North, but with whom he [[bonds]] closely. Soon, the Mains from the South and the Hazards from the North become friends despite the turbulent [[era]] [[leading]] to civil war. [[The]] theme of [[family]], [[friendship]] and doing the right thing even when the nation was [[falling]] apart is at the heart of this otherwise soap opera full of [[action]] and [[romance]]. [[Clariss]] and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray [[sisters]] who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard ([[John]] [[Stockwell]]. Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is [[fun]] to watch on screen. Though the series didn't cover [[everything]] in Jakes' novels, what we see is a condensed [[version]] of it and they changed a few things to [[make]] it a sort of historical romance with history lessons attached. The characters [[find]] themselves in all the major Civil War scenes - Harper's [[Ferry]] where abolitionist and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, the ex-slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and we are privy to the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook) battle out the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players including Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Several veteran Hollywood actors from the Golden Era - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Havilland have cameos and it's interesting to see them. This is not historical fact, it's historical FICTION and purely dramatized entertainment. But it's got cliffhanger endings and beautiful cinematography, costumes and locations. It is like watching an epic movie that runs longer than Gone With The Wind with with war scenes in it! The script may be bad at times and the acting may not be the best, despite the good casting. Swayze hams it up as does Terri Garber but some performances, like that of Kirstie Alley, James Read (as George Hazard)and Leslie Anne Downes as the beautiful and strong Madeline are really good performances. They shot in sets and in Southern locations.The music is enchanting and this is a feel good film in which we root for the good guys and watch the villains scheme and ultimately get their comeuppance.

"Evan Almighty continues the mainstream Bruce Almighty franchise, this time with newsman turned freshman Congressman from Buffalo, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), at it's center. A wholly [[innocuous]] (and not even really self-doubting) man, God (Morgan Freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon Baxter, in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness, so that Baxter can ""change the world"" (aka, pay it forward).<br /><br />Think of Evan Almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'Distinguished Gentlemen.' Baxter is not a con, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially, is harmful to the environment.

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather [[absurd]] depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely [[hopeless]] when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. [[Not]] impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no [[better]] than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. [[If]] she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are [[lousy]] dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final film is a letdown.","Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.

"Spoiler [[Alert]] - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to [[completely]] [[explain]].<[[br]] /><br />'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most [[successful]] expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and vision since the [[first]] season of his 'Twin Peaks' TV series. [[As]] Lynch enthusiasts [[know]], his is a style and vision uniquely [[blended]] from [[film]] noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology  with a [[healthy]] [[dose]] of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for [[good]] [[measure]]. [[All]] these elements are richly at work in 'Mulholland Drive,' [[making]] for a riveting, hair-raising, and [[highly]] satisfying film experience  especially if one does not [[become]] overly obsessed with [[trying]] to [[make]] all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />The film [[features]] wonderful performances by Naomi [[Watts]] and Laura Harring in the [[lead]] roles of young women whose lives intersect in [[various]] ways [[amid]] a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated [[blend]] of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their [[seemingly]] random [[initial]] meeting occurs after the film's opening [[scene]], in which Harring's character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to [[mention]] horrific, automobile accident. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland [[Drive]] to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her [[way]] to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi [[Watts]]) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt Ruth,' a purportedly [[successful]] actress who is off to Canada to [[begin]] a new [[movie]]. [[As]] we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, [[shortly]] after winning a jitterbug contest.<[[br]] /><br />A [[highly]] energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue [[sequences]] that frame Betty's descent from the clichéd [[would-be-starlet's]] bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned [[lover]] and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own [[name]], the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a [[movie]] [[poster]] for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns Aunt Ruth's [[apartment]]. ([[Actually]], it turns out Aunt Ruth has long [[since]] deceased and [[whose]] apartment we're really in is a good question to be [[resolved]] in [[future]] viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful.

[[And]] that's just what director Anthony Asquith [[provided]] the British with 1943's naval [[war]] film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than [[60]] years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It doesn't [[help]] that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted [[men]] from the officers can be jarring. Here, as in so [[many]] other British war [[films]], the men invariably have thick regional working class [[accents]] while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at [[home]] in England's [[finest]] ruling-class establishments. In this movie, Freddie Taylor (John [[Mills]]), the captain of the submarine Sea [[Tiger]], is [[clever]], confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, [[quick]] to make a decision. And it helps that [[he's]] lucky. [[His]] men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent at their [[jobs]] and [[always]] ready with a joke when things [[get]] tense. [[Although]] we spend the first third of the [[movie]] [[getting]] to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense [[quickly]]. <br /><br />Taylor and his sub are [[ordered]] to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. [[They]] just [[miss]] the ship when it enters the Kiel [[Canal]] and [[heads]] into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides the [[Sea]] [[Tiger]] will [[go]] after it, through mine fields, anti-sub nets and with a [[real]] risk of not having enough fuel to return to [[home]] base. [[After]] several tense situations, the confrontation [[takes]] [[place]]. The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive, not [[knowing]] if it had done its job. After a [[clever]] subterfuge, Taylor outfoxes a couple of German destroyers but then [[realizes]] there is not enough fuel. [[He]] plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when, just at the [[last]] [[moment]], James Hobson (Eric Portman), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who [[speaks]] German, says there is a [[small]] Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. [[He]] [[thinks]] it [[might]] [[still]] be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.","[[if]] you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not [[evident]] that you're going to come out on top, [[that]] the things you'll be concerned with is to [[work]] up the morale of the civilians...to [[assume]] that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to [[win]] all the odds in a noble cause.

"Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one [[weird]] film! Supposedly an insight into the human mind, Subconscious Cruelty is comprises four macabre and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment, entitled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm up, but it's good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments. It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table, while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I've got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for visceral viewing. The following story is the best of the bunch, and takes in the ""old favourite"" sick movie theme of incest. The segment follows a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He's repulsed by her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and naturally he gets his way. This story stands out because of the monotonous and 'matter of fact' narration, as well as the ending - which doesn't fail to deliver the shocks. This segment is [[well]] acted, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty.<br /><br />Naturally, the next two sections aren't as good as the second one; so the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain still [[manages]] to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesn't do it right away, however, as the third segment is the weakest of the film, and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground. It's very surreal, and therefore memorable for that same reason; but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it, and I was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section. The film ends on a high, however, as while I'm not entirely sure what the point was - the final segment features the film's [[best]] imagery. This segment focuses on religion, and certainly isn't for anyone that values it! Director Karim Hussain has achieved something here - as while this collection of four 'extreme' stories doesn't come together as a complete whole, the film almost feels tasteful as it's shot in such an eloquent and eye catching manner.

"When I put this movie in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: Awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. But, to my disappointment, not any of this is to be found in Atlantis: Milo's Return. Had I read some reviews first, I might not have been so let down. The following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.<br /><br />When the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked Atlantis: Milo's Return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations I had. The music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (With the exception of a few characters, like the voice of Sweet). The actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. The storyline is also pretty [[weak]], as its more like three episodes of Schooby-Doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time.

I didnt laugh a single time, although I might have sniggered once or twice.<br /><br />To the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially [[care]] for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: If you liked schooby-doo, you [[might]] like this movie. If you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have [[nothing]] else to do. And I suspect it might be a good kids movie, but I wouldn't know.

"Duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler Edgar, with his eyes on a big inheritance, decides to dope them and get them out of the picture.

"I wasn't impressed with the Graffiti Artist, despite it's artsy (aka. low budget improvisation) appeal. There is little dialog and at least for me, I was disappointed that it didn't give more credit or promote the work of guerrilla artists such as these. [[Instead]], it was a story that covers familiar territory. Two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, tagging partners, and eventually experiment with a relationship. They seem like opposites, rather uncomfortable together. Little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at rapid speed (although, this I can understand because it's only 70 minutes or so). There's been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point that the sphere of independent film is starting to become just as saturated with this particular storytelling just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more.<br /><br />Much of the film may bore the viewer who needs immediate dialog and purpose. The primary figure of this story (at least extensively), performs his routines with nearly no dialog, no insight, and nothing else to carry the viewer. And, for a short film, I wished they could've gotten to the point a lot faster. That, aside from the typical plot annoyed me. Yet, there was something about a momentary glimpse into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even if most of it was rather unoccupied time.<br /><br />Recommended if you're tired of the mainstream crap and don't mind an indie picture and have some interested into this underground, urban art form. But, you really have to watch it for yourself, because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste.

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], starting with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an [[in-your-face]] introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the period. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.","One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no.

"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern [[belle]]"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola [[Senatore]]) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.[[e]]. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of [[bloodthirsty]] cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who's under the control of Jim [[Jones-type]] cult leader Jonas [[Melvyn]] (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out LSD, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping [[Agren]] with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood.

"I gave ""Airport '79"" only two stars because it's a [[truly]] [[lousy]] film. Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) This is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />A'79 really does seem like an early version of ""Airplane!"" Every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's truly funny.<br /><br />And I'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing.

"This adaption contains two parts: <br /><br />1. The ""now"" time, when Gulliver is at home in England and soon is put into a mental asylum by the Evil Dr. Bates <br /><br />2. The ""described"" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels.<br /><br />The times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo, which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part, and followed the book as written. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs Gulliver gets very little mention. The travels - in plural - are depicted as one in the movie. There are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there, look at them if you want that stuff. The ""now"" time part adds absolutely [[nothing]] to the story's value, is a complete invention by the movie adapters, and takes valuable time from the real story. All the time when this was going on I was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown.<br /><br />So much for the drawbacks. The parts which actually are part of the real story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and a few medium-sized) parts of the real travels are simply cut out, but that does not make the story halt. This is AFAIK the only version which depicts all four travels, and for that the movie should get special mention. <br /><br />The two interspersed parts get approximately equal time. I rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. Averaging out, I give it a 4/10. If only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99% on the actual travels, since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels. <br /><br />Why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon Swift's work, I do not know. My best guess is that CGI was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets, GCI, etc. in order to keep total costs under some limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series which clocked in at some set number of minutes.","This adaption contains two parts: <br /><br />1.

All the time when this was going on I was longing for the next bit of real travel to be shown.<br /><br />So much for the drawbacks. The parts which actually are part of the real story are well done, and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and a few medium-sized) parts of the real travels are simply cut out, but that does not make the story halt. This is AFAIK the only version which depicts all four travels, and for that the movie should get special mention. <br /><br />The two interspersed parts get approximately equal time. I rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. Averaging out, I give it a 4/10. If only they would have cut the rubbish and focused 99% on the actual travels, since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent on filling in the details cut from the travels. <br /><br />Why some adapter think that he is gifted enough to improve upon Swift's work, I do not know. My best guess is that CGI was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets, GCI, etc. in order to keep total costs under some limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series which clocked in at some set number of minutes.",0.40415239334106445,0.7184404730796814,0,1,0,240,"Successful"
"The Romanian cinema is little [[known]] out of Romania.

"...and that's a goddamn shame! [[Please]] [[make]] the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of [[Dracula]] 3000. [[This]] must be the WORST vampire-flick of the new millennium so [[far]] (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they don't get [[much]] worse than this). Don't be fooled be the movie's cool [[H]].R. Gigeresque cover. This is so [[bad]], it's almost hilarious. I can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured. I laughed my ass off, I yelled at the screen, I sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... This film has 'cheap & cheese' written all over it. The best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay CGI of two space-ships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. And, indeed, it all goes [[downhill]] rapidly after that.<br /><br />The crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the Demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. They enter it, thus sealing their fate. This movie is, above all things, a shameless [[low-budget]] ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak's character, Aurora, reveals she's a robot. Coolio goes [[badly]] over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Dien's character's named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he [[looks]] like...,er well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, former commander of the Demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock, one of the most [[pathetic]] and laughable Dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors.

And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.","...and that's a goddamn shame! [[gonna]] [[may]] the sun rise and have it incinerate all copies of [[dracula]] 3000. [[some]] must be the WORST vampire-flick of the new millennium so [[well]] (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they don't get [[many]] worse than this). Don't be fooled be the movie's cool [[h]].R. Gigeresque cover. This is so [[great]], it's almost hilarious. I can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured. I laughed my ass off, I yelled at the screen, I sat there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... This film has 'cheap & cheese' written all over it. The best thing of this movie are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less okay CGI of two space-ships. But when Casper Van Dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling something fishy. And, indeed, it all goes [[down]] rapidly after that.<br /><br />The crew of a salvage-spaceship finds an abandoned vessel, the Demeter, which seems to be heading for earth. They enter it, thus sealing their fate. This movie is, above all things, a shameless [[weird]] ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak's character, Aurora, reveals she's a robot. Coolio goes [[absolutely]] over-the-top as the dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Dien's character's named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he [[i]] like...,er well, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, former commander of the Demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he really does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock, one of the most [[outrageous]] and laughable Dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room.

"[[Set]] in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the [[execution]] of Louis XVI, this film portrays the [[power]] [[struggle]] between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his [[finest]]) and Robespierre (a commanding performance by the Polish [[actor]] Wojciech Pszoniak). [[The]] moderate revolutionary Danton has [[returned]] to Paris from his country seat where he has been [[since]] being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public [[Safety]] in the previous year by Robespierre. He is [[opposed]] to ""The Reign Of Terror"" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be [[opposed]] to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary [[people]] and tries to persuade Robespierre to [[curb]] the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are [[afraid]] that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown, and [[put]] Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. [[This]] was the first French language [[film]] [[made]] by Andrzej Wajda after he had [[arrived]] in France from Poland. His Polish film company was [[closed]] down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity [[trade]] union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and [[early]] eighties. His previous [[film]] ""Man Of Iron"" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its [[leader]] Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the [[relationship]] of Walesa and the Polish leader General [[Jaruselski]], and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule [[despite]] having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. [[The]] film is [[based]] on the Polish play ""The Danton Affair"" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its [[release]] the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. [[But]] what the film does is to concentrate on the [[behind-the-scenes]] meetings of the [[Committees]] and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of [[Paris]].","[[starting]] in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the [[reign]] of Louis XVI, this film portrays the [[leadership]] [[talks]] between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his [[worst]]) and Robespierre (a commanding performance by the Polish [[actress]] Wojciech Pszoniak).

"The family happiness is crumbling when, the from the beginning rich father Ward (Michael Ontkean), gets poor and cannot support the family any longer. Then the mother Faye (Jaclyn Smith) has to take the role as the breadwinner in the family and starts to work in order to support the family and at the same time, periodically alone, has to manage the family life. Not always that good, but as good as she can. The family life hardly gets easier when the father learns that the son Lionel (Joe Flanigan ""Stargate Atlantis"") is gay and is living together with his lover John (Joel Gretsch ""The 4400"") also an old family friend, resulting in that the father makes clear to Lionel that he is no longer welcome in the family. Lionel is the one who meant the most to his sister Anne (Leslie Horan) during her up-bringing, since the family neglected her. Anne cannot stand the fact that their father have cut the cords with Lionel and therefore she run away from home. As this wasn't enough, the son Greg (Brian Krause ""Charmed"") enlists in the marines and is sent to war.

"For producer David O. Selznick, no one director would ever do. Hence, on ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) we get two  Charles Vidor and John Huston. Though both men were quite accomplished in their own right, neither could make head or tail of this [[disastrous]] remake of Hemmingway's magnum opus. Hemmingway in general has never translated well from book to screen. But under Selznick's zeal to transform it into his next 'Gone With The Wind' the excursion is both punishing and exhaustive. At this point in Selznick's career, he was no longer the titan who could take ""box office poison"" and transform it into Gone With The Wind. Tired, frail, minus his studio, and, with an impending sense that his second marriage to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick handed the creative reigns of this flick over to Fox Studios  but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the set.<br /><br />By now one is, or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent's tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and [[dull]]. In the final reel, Jones' facial contortions during child birth are so bad I am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general release. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she's far too wise to play the optimistic Catharine with any great conviction. Yet, older actresses have frequently managed to make an audience forget discrepancies in age. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that she doesn't fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with to stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong. The supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are wasted bits of nonsense that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their canons of film making.<br /><br />The anamorphic picture element for ""A Farewell to Arms"" looks good enough, though there's just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this reviewer's liking. Overall, colors are subtle and muted, though balanced in accordance with the DeLuxe color processing employed at this time. Some fading is evident. Flesh tones don't appear very natural.

"Perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be ""The International Year of the Cinematic Crocodile""! The ridiculous ""Primeval"" came first, about a croc named Gustave (!) ruling the swamps in Burundi. Then there was ""Lake Placid 2"", a low-profiled and made-for-TV sequel to a forgettable original. Thirdly, there's this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of Aussie horror and, finally, I have yet to see the promising ""Rogue"". The last one is likely to be the best, considering the involvement of the upcoming Aussie horror talent Greg McLean (""Wolf Creek""). ""Black Water"" certainly isn't a complete waste of time and film, but it's another pretty [[pointless]] survival flick that confuses real-life agony with horror. Pardon my bluntness, especially since I honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal, but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense! Three young people travel through Northern Australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas. It doesn't take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam barely manage to escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing up a tree. Even though he remains unseen most of the time, the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it does sound an awful lot like the plot of ""Open Water"" indeed. Replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable Aussie swamp, and there you have it. Oh well, ""Black Water"" at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster. It has to be said, the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water. The three-headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time? The based-on-true-events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions, like limited images of the fantastic filming locations, dialogs and amiable character drawings.","Perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be ""The International Year of the Cinematic Crocodile""!

Her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is running out for her; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size. The passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes.

An attractive young woman(Julia ""Rayanne"" Ruiz)does not want to marry someonelse's choice for her husband; so she is put under a powerful Mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. Her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is running out for her; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. Before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size. The passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes.

"'Oppenheimer' with Sam Waterston in the title role and with David Suchet as [[Evard]] Teller is an example of the docudrama at its very [[finest]]. [[Well]] written, well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters, [[highly]] informative, and very entertaining. The set designs and costumes capture the feel of the US during World War 2, and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at Los Alamos and caught up in the excitement of the Manhattan Project. The only [[downside]] is that this is a British production, and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing American accent.

The storyline is fully consistent with Richard Rhodes' [[definitive]] history of the development of the atomic bomb. Sadly, the mini-series was shown only a couple of times on PBS at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion.<br /><br />'Oppenheimer' compares favorably to the more recent 'Fat Man & Little Boy' feature film with Paul Newman as Leslie Groves (the chronically overweight and rather homely General would be thoroughly [[flattered]]) and Dwight Schultz (alumnus of TV's 'A-Team') as Oppenheimer.

"Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story line is OK, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average. I guess the blame is to the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India from where her original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in a totally different cast, I just wonder what a spectacular movie it would have been if it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. The current actors Lisa Ray (who's just good for squirming in Bombay Dyeing bedsheets) and John Abraham are [[pathetic]], need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. The kid had done an outstanding job. The editing and the flow of the movie is also not something you would have expected from Deepa. Great subject, sends out a strong message about a practice which is still pretty rampant in rural India but falls short of the standards Deepa set for herself in Fire and Earth. Watch it once...when its on DVD, don't bother paying $10 to see it....well its out beats the average Hindi movie any day","Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about.

"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless mess. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the ""actress"" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.","There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing.

"It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be right', but some can be wrong, and this one is.

Any production has to try to explain why Hamlet delays, why he is incapable of action. 2. His sexual disgust. His total revulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to in bed fill him with an utter disgust for all things sexual and this means that any kind of relationship with Ophelia is impossible.

"Choose your fate: The terrible [[tykes]] of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...[[well-developed]] girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all there at St. Trinian's, that remarkably easy-going English school for girls led by headmistress Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton is fond of pointing out, ""In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared."" Miss Fritton sounds something like a melding of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and definitely has Sim's droll and deadpan comic genes. <br /><br />In The Belles of St. Trinian's, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper English education. The sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, Arab Boy, is being trained near the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. ""It's got something...I don't know quite what,"" says Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff, ""but send a few bottles up to my room."") <br /><br />Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter.

Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns in a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. ""Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!"" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is ""a gay arcadia of happy girls."" Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.","Choose your fate: The terrible [[play]] of the fourth form, playing practical jokes that involve axes, or the...ummm...[[many]] girls of the sixth form, who discovered some time ago cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. The problem is that one set comes with the other. They are all there at St. Trinian's, that remarkably easy-going English school for girls led by headmistress Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton is fond of pointing out, ""In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared."" Miss Fritton sounds something like a melding of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and definitely has Sim's droll and deadpan comic genes. <br /><br />In The Belles of St. Trinian's, a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the brink of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a rich sheik sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive a proper English education. The sheik also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, Arab Boy, is being trained near the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. ""It's got something...I don't know quite what,"" says Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff, ""but send a few bottles up to my room."") <br /><br />Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector.

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Some bunch of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. Then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and SURPRISE! something eats him. The other two dimwits are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a Pizza Delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, minimum). Bairstow is [[supposed]] to join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that picks up [[Bairstow]] to take him to Camp C has a handful of the kind of weirdoes that usually [[populate]] movies like ""PITCH BLACK"" ""THE THING"" etc. The truck happens to [[drive]] across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up Bairstow, since they were travelling the same road??). So they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. The main lunatic in the group, Karl, decides that they must find the killer. So the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is [[stuck]] in the desert. The dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around.

[[Sounds]] exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). Now, last time I checked, ants could move around on their own, without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure. If all they need was something hard, they [[could]] have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form. The whole story is really, really [[dumb]], and the ant explanation is the only one given. The rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet. There is a spare ant-brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel.","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Some bunch of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area.

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise [[predictable]] western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".","Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly routine outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise [[silly]] western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets.

"Normally, movies [[stay]] out of the realm of ""domestic drama,"" and for [[good]] reason: who [[wants]] to intentionally seek entertainment from a [[story]] about what they or those close to them have to [[deal]] with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all [[classes]] and custody battles are ugly and necessary [[parts]] of it. [[That's]] not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- [[that's]] [[sad]] reality. <br /><br />Normally, divorce or custody is [[simply]] part of a greater story and affects the way we [[understand]] it or relate to its [[characters]].

[[That's]] a challenge for both this film and its audience: [[turn]] something so real into something that can [[capture]] our attention and then make us not [[feel]] spiteful as the mirror is held up to our [[face]]. [[Writer]]/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in [[impressive]] fashion in adapting this novel by Avery [[Corman]].<br /><[[br]] />The story, as one [[would]] expect, is [[quite]] simple: Big business advertising [[man]] Ted Kramer ([[Dustin]] Hoffman) [[comes]] home to [[find]] his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin [[Henry]]). Ted then [[must]] [[quickly]] learn to be an active father in the boys' [[life]] and as soon as he does, Joanna [[brings]] a custody suit [[upon]] him.<br /><br />To [[make]] an Oscar-winning drama about [[something]] so generic and [[particularly]] dialogue- heavy first [[takes]] tremendous acting talent. You don't get much [[better]] than [[Hoffman]] and [[Streep]]. [[Hoffman]] is in his prime in this role: his [[first]] Oscar win after three other [[notable]] nominations. [[He]] creates a thorough character, one whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways clearly change as he [[learns]] to be a better father and the sole care-giver. Streep [[wins]] her [[first]] Oscar in only the second [[major]] role of her career as a woman who doesn't get [[much]] screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to leave as [[well]] as renewed sense of identity when she [[returns]] to take custody.

Benton's previous notable credits (""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Superman"") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.<br /><br />You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new understanding of a subject that's so familiar.","Normally, movies [[go]] out of the realm of ""domestic drama,"" and for [[different]] reason: who [[want]] to intentionally seek entertainment from a [[tale]] about what they or those close to them have to [[reckon]] with in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all [[people]] and custody battles are ugly and necessary [[kind]] of it. [[life]] not escapism -- the number one reason the average person turns to movies -- [[beyond]] [[harsh]] reality. <br /><br />Normally, divorce or custody is [[also]] part of a greater story and affects the way we [[know]] it or relate to its [[character]]. ""Kramer [[w]]. Kramer"" focuses on it and [[has]] us to understand why we do it and why that [[sets]] it so troubling. [[tis]] a challenge for both this film and its audience: [[transformed]] something so real into something that can [[captured]] our attention and then make us not [[seem]] spiteful as the mirror is held up to our [[gazes]]. [[film]]/director Robert Benton definitely achieves both and in [[marvelous]] fashion in adapting this novel by Avery [[stone]].<br /><[[si]] />The story, as one [[had]] expect, is [[very]] simple: Big business advertising [[son]] Ted Kramer ([[dustin]] Hoffman) [[leaves]] home to [[visit]] his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) is leaving him and their 7-year-old son Billy (Justin [[henry]]). Ted then [[has]] [[now]] learn to be an active father in the boys' [[school]] and as soon as he does, Joanna [[makes]] a custody suit [[beside]] him.<br /><br />To [[say]] an Oscar-winning drama about [[nothing]] so generic and [[especially]] dialogue- heavy first [[is]] tremendous acting talent.

[[Basically]] everything he says is slurred and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just the poor productions values... [[hard]] to [[say]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Anyway, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a film that just doesn't [[work]]. That's a shame, too, since the film has a terrific opening and a generally interesting plot. Ultimitely the production values are just too low and the action just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods. The story deals with a US war [[plane]] which is filled with gold, money, and medals, which crashes into a lake in New Zealand during WWII. The plane remains lost for about forty years or so until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles onto it. At first he gathers up all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, actually getting $75 apiece for them! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. Before you can blink, all of the attention brings a wealthy scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals. The old drunk's business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. [[The]] resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be.<br /><br />The acting is rather [[awful]], save for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do some kind of (I guess) Austrailian accent, but it is [[hardly]] convincing. Lesley Ann Warren isn't too bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He's basically doing his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that's saying something. Hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. I don't recall if he'd had them straightened by the time he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast are pretty untalented. Probably mostly locals who never did much else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film, and the lack of danger. The villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.<br /><br />The film does have its strengths, though. The beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds a little too much like the one in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful. The thing you'll remember most is the drunken antics of Donald Pleasence, though. He was almost enough to save this film.

It's the conclusion and [[cause]] of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this [[cause]] an average is taken of most people, and [[still]], most [[others]] are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle [[enthusiasts]]. But I digress. The movie. I really don't [[have]] to waste my [[years]] writing about it. Let's just say I found it to be tailor made for [[really]] two [[group]] of people, young teens, at the age where [[extreme]] action movies of any sort just hit the spot, and goth [[ones]] that just love to [[break]] down whatever Gothic vampire fantasy they can [[keep]] their [[eye]] on. If you aren't in one of those categories, you will find this movie [[delightful]]. I did enjoy the first Underworld. It was fresh at the time and [[possesses]] a [[kind]] of edgy quality. The second was a [[treat]] trying in plot, but I did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times. But this whole movie [[works]] [[though]] a sci-fi channel production or even a [[mini]] series. I found the actors to be over-directed. [[sometimes]] body language stiffened into un-natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived. Lines were spit out like [[other]] actors would spit out lines of Shakespeare, reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role, but in doing so, crudely bludgeoning the role. [[no]] plot was dry and predictable right from the start. [[you]] [[find]] myself wishing things to just ""move [[onto]]"" as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. I tried to care at first, but my brain was forced to shut off. By the end climax, I actually caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all. If you're a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth, sure, have at it. [[unlike]] the rest of us, forget it, like [[i]] about to do right now.",0.016035795211791992,0.6195642352104187,0,1,0,626,"Successful"

Nothing ""big"" happened to mark some sort of turning point in Australia's history.... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-general of Australia - John Kerr.<br /><br />For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonised by the British. As time went on, it became apparent that Australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly from the British; rather, Australia would be run by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the British system. This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes Australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two ""pro-crown"" sections that were included and remain there to this day. These are more or less regarded as the ""reserve powers of the Crown (king/queen of Great Britain)."" The first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the Governor-general. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the Queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the ""Executive"" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the Governor-general. As such, the Govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by Australian parliament if he thinks fit. For instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By ""convention"" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to sign it, he will, almost always without question. In fact, by ""convention"" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the Governor-general's ""pleasure."" Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or Prime Minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film ""the dismissal."") Whether 'at the Governor-General's pleasure' can be construed as ""the unfettered right to dismiss"" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia.<br /><br />Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. It didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the Governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />In terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. The film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. There were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Further, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. Moreover, any that we're raised, for example Connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. The film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. This was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.<br /><br />The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in its short life. I am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid.

"""Stripperella"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />Back in late June of 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were ""Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really [[good]], it had an awesome intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[funny]] as hell! The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy.

"For those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of Keystone Cop tactics.<br /><br />Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's chubby daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells a 'little lie' to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house they discover the drunken Vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for Jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that Vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to go along with the idea and before long Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents, includes Jack as his best man. At the wedding the truth comes out and to Jimi's surprise his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful.<br /><br />The cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs as Vanessa; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in Indian movies.

"OK. Finally, a horror film that's done well. As soon as I heard the music, I knew that some effort had been made in creating what I consider to be an almost masterpiece of good ol'horror.

"Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. The beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and I loved the sets, the costuming, and Helena's artwork. The subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were [[excruciating]]. The dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the CGI horrifying. Events occurred for the flimsiest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed. I only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with Gaiman's strong written work.","Having enjoyed Neil Gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in ""The Dream Hunters"") in the past, I figured Mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed.

"How do I describe the horrors?!!! First, some points: First, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- I saw this over 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.<br /><br />Secondly, I am giving away some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much of a plot.<br /><br />Finally, I don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.<br /><br />This film was directed by proto-auteur Luis Bunuel. He was a surrealist and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's. Surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real, yet often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- Dada, or father.<br /><br />Made in black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in Spain and France between the world wars.<br /><br />Dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- The Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting clocks), and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell.<br /><br />Here's what I recall most about this film: a girl meets up with a cow; her eye gets slashed by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. There is not, as I said, much of a plot, but then again, that must be the point.<br /><br />This was attacked as porn back then, and would be again today. One of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.","How do I describe the horrors?!!!

"After slightly over 50 years of avid film watching, I've come up with some simple rules for making good movies.<br /><br />1.	Introduce your main characters early, certainly within the first half hour 2.	Keep your characters to a minimum. If adapting a novel, combine characteristics and actions of minor characters<br /><br /> into one person 3.	Make sure your characters actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation 4.	Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it must not be confusing, either 5.	Get the best music money can buy. Frequently it matters more than acting, photography, etc. 6.	Usually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes, it's not going to get any better<br /><br />`Cannon for Cordoba' is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the [[worst]] I've ever heard in a modestly budgeted movie. This is altogether surprising considering Bernstein's credentials (`Man With the Golden Arm,' `The Magnificent Seven,' `The Great Escape,' `Sons of Katie Elder'). Paul Wendkos' direction is [[lackluster]] and confusing. Performances vary from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the usually reliable George Peppard falling somewhere in the middle. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.

"1959 was a landmark in the world of film. Several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, Hitchcock's North By Northwest, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of Life. Add a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Hitch's Vertigo, and Nick Ray's Wind Across the Everglades, and you've got a pretty good summing up of what was possible within the classic Hollywood style.<br /><br />At the same time, two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films. [[One]] was Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had certain things in [[common]], largely improvised acting by non stars, handheld cameras, low budgets, and a certain youthful, jazzy swagger. In certain [[ways]], though, they couldn't be farther [[apart]]. Godard was [[still]] a believer in the director as arbiter of style. [[He]] [[knew]] more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was [[filled]] with the iconography of the classic crime film. [[Cassavetes]], on the other [[hand]], was an actor, and a refugee from New York's underground theater [[scene]]. [[His]] first film [[shows]] him little impressed with the cinema, and a big believer in actors. Godard's [[film]] [[constantly]] references it's own artifice, whereas Shadows aims for a certain [[kind]] of naturalism.<[[br]] /><br />[[It]] doesn't reach it, [[mainly]] because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. But it feels [[powerful]], kinetic but lilting like the cool jazz on the score, certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on [[display]] here. It ultimately doesn't hold together, mainly because Cassavetes' actors here are amateurish [[beatniks]], where [[Cassavetes]] style requires strong, imaginative actors. His later [[work]] with Gena Rowlands, Ben [[Gazarra]], and Peter Falk blows this out of the water. [[Due]] to the director's technical inexperience, some bits of dialogue had to be [[redubbed]] later, which defeats the freshness of the improvisation. [[Still]] it's fascinating to watch, both for the [[great]] moments (like the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her [[dissapointment]] with losing her virginity) and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way.","1959 was a landmark in the world of film.

"Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure starred in the 70s, this is the [[stagiest]] of all. It's so stagy, you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very, very big budget school play, or indeed, a very very low budget action movie, which it actually is. It's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries, and I do hope it was. The genre didn't die peacefully, but in horrible agony, amidst a lot of smoke, fake blood and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing must have felt a boy again, as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap-holes of the Underworld. What a sport he was, to accept a part in this mishmash and carry it so bravely.<br /><br />Shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy, now unbearable synthesizer soundtrack, the main anti-attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always monsters like that in a Burroughs adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous, helpless or void of any credibility. On a few occasions, during the elevated action-combat scenes where Mr McClure heroically attacks the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound as his head bangs against the side of a triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over. Indeed, there is a great deal of unmotivated exploding as the film (and the genre) draws towards the finale. And lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworldly accent.<br /><br />The triple bill, currently on the market, features this film plus two others - The Land That Time Forgot and The War Lords Of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong entries, especially the first one, with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns. Don't expect any of these qualities from this film. Get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see.

"(My Synopsis) Rae ([[Christina]] Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin [[Timberlake]]) to fulfill her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leaves Rae all alone. Rae is not alone for long, because she is the town tramp with a powerful need to hook-up with a man.

Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain.<br /><br />(My Comment) The movie has a deep meaning to it once you get past the sex and violence. The film has a different feel to it.

The hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist.

I love all things related to aliens and this story definitely delivered some good ideas. So if you also share an interest in things extraterrestrial, you should be pretty happy with Progeny.

Yep, even by the consistently awesome Mr. Dourif, who still does deliver the best performance. Though the black head doctor, delivers his lines really well. There are a few points in the flick where some of the delivery is cringe or laugh worthy, which is fine in my book. I like them cheesy and this had a little bit of some nice stinky cheese, and I mean that in a good way.<br /><br />Anyways, with a less than stellar script you can't really blame all the actors.

"I'm 35. Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead, and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was cool also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent.

"I had always eyed Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of Lamberto Bava's terrible DEMONS (1985); the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but I decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we're in full Halloween swing. I checked out the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD prior to viewing the main feature  the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but, then, the film proper (which makes no more sense than what's presented in that frenzied two-minute montage and, in retrospect, can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights) proved a definite [[let-down]]!<br /><br />Opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative. Consequently, several characters randomly take center-stage throughout  with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on, the sinister-looking Bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) resulting a mere red herring, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat-shaped demon (culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all-too-obviously from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year old Asia Argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan's daughter (who emerges as the only survivor by the end). Incidentally, the older Argento also co-wrote the film's story and screenplay along with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with Dario in the early stages of production) original helmer Lamberto Bava and prolific genre scribe Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004).<br /><br />The extremely muddled second half of the film, then, sees a group of people  including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering English couple (whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline)  similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits (the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult)not that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of Luis Bunuel's sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) you see!

[[after]] the beginning of the movie, the roles are clear-cut; the [[victim]] are innocent, the cop is the good guy and Howdy is pure evil. By the second act, however, things have [[turned]] a little. You want Howdy to be evil but it turns out that he is really just a victim of circumstance and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. It is terrifying to find yourself cheering for the ""bad"" guy.<br /><br />A couple people have mentioned that Strangeland should have been broken into two separate movies. To be sure, there are definitely two separate ""acts"" but this movie works so [[poorly]] because the two acts are back to back. The first act is the typical psycho-thriller but the second act is the most disturbing because of the viewers reaction to the situation. I do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel.<br /><br />As a big horror movie fan, I [[almost]] recommend this film. It is the first horror movie EVER to give me nightmares.",0.01673489809036255,0.6624728441238403,1,0,1,568,"Successful"

I, because of my [[80's]] style early [[Childhood]], watched many TV [[shows]] and saw Many movies that other kids didn't [[see]], and this movie was one of those, and one of the [[greatest]] too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore [[Seville]] and David [[Seville]]. David, the Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks [[help]] him pack. While they are talking, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the [[world]] ([[Even]] [[though]], technically Dave is only going to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as ''The [[World'']]). [[David]] is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of [[Miss]] [[Miller]], much to the displeasure of the boys. [[Soon]] Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. [[Later]], at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of ''Around the World in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). [[After]] losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the [[sky]] by a crocodile, [[Alvin]] get's in an argument with Brittany about who would really [[win]] a race around the world. [[Two]] diamond smugglers [[sitting]] at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia [[Furschtien]] overhear their argument and, [[needing]] a safe [[way]] of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into [[delivering]] them for them. [[They]] set up a race [[around]] the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness ([[Secretely]] [[filled]] with diamonds) at drop offs [[around]] the world and receive a [[doll]] in the opposing team's likeness (secretely [[filled]] with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. [[The]] [[winning]] team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. [[They]] do this because they believe that Jamal ([[An]] Interpol [[agent]] who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the top, Don't you know! we never stop believing now''","I was -[[against]] most of the reviewers- not born in the [[80s]].

This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the top, Don't you know! we never stop believing now''",0.024970710277557373,0.5172755718231201,1,0,1,1276,"Successful"
"Visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-TV quality. The romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is simply [[NOT]] plausible. Of course, from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns. This film had lots of promise, which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized. Perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but I certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.","Visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-TV quality.

The head of the agency Bosarian (Martin Landau) has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike.

Aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a Ray film is no where to be found. I don't think anyone was expecting Thomas to get naked but she doesn't wear one sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me from ogling her in those tight jeans and admiring her near perfect form but Ray really blew it in this case. Like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan, and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste him time with such junk like this but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas any good in this film? Who cares! I think she showed that she could have become a popular ""B"" movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker.","I was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a [[highly]] made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that.

Like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan, and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste him time with such junk like this but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas any good in this film? Who cares! I think she showed that she could have become a popular ""B"" movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker.",0.16213208436965942,0.6347280144691467,0,1,0,285,"Successful"

"This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult [[classic]], double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?<br /><br />For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in. The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with; American boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded. Great, [[great]] set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. Now, mix in Catholic influenced social conventions, Mexican folk lore, and we are not in Kansas anymore. <br /><br />Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN, not the literal translation. As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. There's even a fan web site for Murray that prints the [[best]], most over the top lines for each movie. First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing, the purple prose, the production values and are told it's SUPPOSED to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. It all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.<br /><br />This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is [[fascinating]]. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.<br /><br />ROBOT/MUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes, sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, logic wise. You don't even get The Angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places, even family trees switch between films. After a while, you start LOOKING for the continuity changes. <br /><br />By now, the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad, nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show, and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. The mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.<br /><br />The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this, because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. Nope.<br /><br />This was PLANNED. <br /><br />Wait until you see the controller it runs from. X box, where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you??? The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end, but actually came back in two more Mexican made movies..it had a FAN BASE.. <br /><br />All in all, a funny quirky finish to a three movie series.

"I would say 'Bride of Chucky' is a ""return to greatness"" but the series was never really great.

So he does, in the role of Jennifer Tilly, who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for 'Star Trek: Voyager.' Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added much needed humor, back-story, drama, tension and a great little sidekick/play-thing for Chucky. And as much as I liked her in the feature, she can't get all the credit: the props (watch the first 1-2 minutes for horror-homages), the writing, the inside jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky lines were [[great]] (""In fact, if (this) were a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to do it justice,"" among others.) Mercifully, Chucky and the series has given up on Andy the ""Hide the Soul"" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He teams up with his ex (Tilly) whom he transfers into a ""Bride"" doll and a couple of Bonnie & Clyde teens (Really, Heigl?) to regain this pendant buried with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' films. It's funny, dark, harmless, gory  but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of screen time, it's always [[great]] to see her. After all, you barely see her play poker anymore.

"This is a fun movie with subtle intention. Its off-beat comedy is [[hilarious]] to me, unfunny to my friends. The soundtrack is [[perfect]].<br /><br />I own this on VHS and I have watched it many, many times, because it's simply a fun and funny love story with great performances by all the principals (though using Joan Cusack solely as a perch for big hair was a waste of her talent. I know, I know, she was still young...).<br /><br />On a sad note, I decided to check out the DVD last night (instead of watching my VHS tape), and was [[SHOCKED]] to find many crucial scenes cut. And on the copy I watched, there was no [[special]] feature of deleted scenes: it was as if the deleted scenes never existed!! I am so [[glad]] I bought the used VHS at a flea market.<br /><br />It is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this, which is another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill, talent, and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl, Dean Stockwell, and Matthew Modine do from [[scene]] to scene ([[Note]] the scene when the grocery carts converge, the [[rolling]] on the floor during the shoot-out in Miami, the Chicken Lickin' debacle, the foot massage, the salon hair-washing.) There is a very ""theatrical"" feel to this film, which may be the turn-off for so many whose poor reviews follow: I know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and [[over-the-top]] performances for [[poor]] acting and worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.<br /><br />The opening credits and first scene rank among my all-time favorites, as [[well]] (another favorite opening credits/first scene: Fly Away Home).<br /><br />Too bad Matthew Modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye; I really like him, and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually, this film is well-cast from soup to nuts: everyone is believable and true to his role. As for the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians - why not? I thought they pulled it off perfectly well.<br /><br />Charming, fun, exciting... what is there not to like? If you want a little fun, watch this quirky, colorful adventure-mob-love story.

"""Black Water"" is one of the most tense films I have viewed in a long time. The story moves fast as it follows three tourists (all great actors) into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. Soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp, they are flipped over by something huge in the water.<br /><br />Hastily, the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. Throughout the next two days, they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye, and he doesn't seem to want to go away. The movie drags just a tad bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? It's so much [[better]] than ""Primeval"" and other recent crocodile/ underwater predator thrillers.

"OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called ""Death Bed"" that came out a few years back, because this one is ""The Bed That Eats"". And how do I even begin to describe this? Well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats. This is as a result of demon teardrops, which of course affect most things, I guess, in a negative way. The bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time. We have a narrator, who is a ghost that sits in the wall behind a painting, and collects all the non-edible goodies (jewelry, etc) that the bed passes on. He died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah. The thing about this movie is that is has a very odd sense of humor to it but it's all played pretty deadpan. The movie is divided into several ""acts"", I guess, ""Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, & Just Desserts"". For fans of the unfathomably weird and bizarre, well, this may just be right up your alley. All I can say is you have to see this one to believe it, it pretty [[well]] defies description. 8 out of 10 stars.","OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called ""Death Bed"" that came out a few years back, because this one is ""The Bed That Eats"".

"So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. However, if you haven't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. Secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. If you played and enjoyed FF7 than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special. If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.","So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.

"Amando [[DeOssorio]] was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of [[telling]] one of his stories. His ""Blind Dead"" series [[started]] off great but had some truly [[laughable]] moments, such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for ""The Ghost Galleon"". In ""The Sea Serpent"", he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature [[aquariums]].<br /><br />A vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly [[cartooned]] into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent American flag and a portrait of a [[deranged-looking]] Ronald Reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the Eighties. The other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be ""1.985"" and Tyria Power's dated Sheena Easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.<br /><br />One of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of Spain for some miniature-set mayhem.<br /><br />Now when I say the monster is unrealistic, I am not exaggerating. It's not just ""sort of"" fake looking. I'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted, but most of the time it looks like it was made out of Crayola markers, a ping pong ball, and an old sock. Not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the ""Jaws"" theme that it's a wonder nobody got sued.<br /><br />Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are caught slumming, and the dialogue could not have been any more [[dismal]]. Through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). None of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. <br /><br />As illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. The end.<br /><br />I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. A lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. At least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. I'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved.

"In 1984, Edgar Reitz surprised [[film-lovers]] all over the world with his epic opus Heimat: A Chronicle of Germany. Eight years [[later]], he came up with a sequel, The [[Second]] Heimat: Chronicle of a Youth, which is [[even]] more astounding than its predecessor.<br /><br />[[Actually]], it's not really a sequel. It's more of a ""[[midquel]]"", as it covers events that took place between the ninth and [[eleventh]] episode of the first Heimat cycle.<br /><[[br]] />[[The]] Second Heimat begins in 1960, four years after [[Hermann]] Simon (Henry Arnold) was separated from his first love, [[Klarchen]], courtesy of his intolerant mother and elder [[brother]] (the controversy had to do with him being a minor, while she was about 25). [[Still]] [[angered]] by those events, the young man [[vows]] never to [[fall]] in love again (a grandiose, if creepy scene), and [[decides]] to [[move]] to Munich (like the director himself did in [[approximately]] the same period), hoping to [[become]] a professional composer after a few years [[spent]] at the music academy. [[He]] stays in Munich for ten [[years]], and the thirteen two-hour episodes of Heimat [[2]] cover that time-frame, each of them focusing on a different [[person]] among Hermann's fellow students, [[people]] who, like him, are searching for a ""second [[home]] country"", be it music, film or something [[else]], in which they can finally live peacefully.<br /><br />[[Like]] the first Heimat, this second cycle is a [[perfect]] union of film and television: the episodic [[structure]] and the various romantic subplots make it [[look]] like a soap opera, in fact The Second Heimat needs to be [[seen]] in its entirety to be successfully embraced, [[whereas]] some chapters of Heimat 1 could be viewed as separate [[stories]] (in particular, the one concerning Hermann's teenage years). The [[style]] and content, however, is pure auteur cinema, with the [[familiar]] black and white/color transitions (actually, a [[tad]] more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being [[underlined]] by the relationship between Hermann and cello player Clarissa Lichtblau (Salome [[Kammer]]): they clearly love each other, yet they keep embarking on [[affairs]] with other people, [[delaying]] the inevitable until it's too late. This [[time]], Reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding his characters ( at one [[point]], Hermann is so disillusioned he says: ""The Beatles are much better than us!""), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s (the '68 revolution especially).<br /><br />Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is set in Venice, whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success).

"As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film ""Moulin Rouge"" and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoir's film-making, I knew that I'd inevitably watch his ""French Cancan"" sooner or later. The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn Montmartre laundress Nini (Françoise Arnoul) into a cancan star, without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress, the belly-dancing Lola (Maria Felix).

"Thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early [[nineties]], but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. Thursday [[utilises]] a few characters mostly within a single location. It works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller. There is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot follows Casey; a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his wife. The pair wants to adopt a child, but things turn awry when Casey receives a visit from his old partner in crime, Nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. Thursday is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal...<br /><br />The first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. The scene is soaked with dark humour and witty dialogues, and that is [[carried]] on [[throughout]] the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very funny [[film]], and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is [[difficult]] to dislike. It's true that the film doesn't bring anything [[new]] to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision [[ensures]] that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. The acting is [[decent]] enough, with the entire cast clearly having [[fun]] with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film together [[well]] in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from James LeGros, [[Paulina]] Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke back him up [[nicely]]. This film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few [[enjoyable]] twists and performances; Thursday is likely to suffice.","Thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early [[fifties]], but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film.

"Mickey Rourke is [[enjoying]] a renaissance at the moment... and fair [[play]] to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you [[much]] more - and you don't want most of it.<br /><br />[[First]] and foremost - this whole thing just doesn't [[make]] [[sense]]. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.<br /><br />However, when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.<br /><br />A wealth of things arise here which just don't [[add]] up : <br /><br />1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.<br /><br />2. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? <br /><br />3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, I may add - to take confession? [[No]] way.<br /><br />4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? <br /><br />5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.<br /><br />6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church ""fixing"" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? <br /><br />7. Why get Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /><br />8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.<br /><br />9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in ""love"" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /><br />10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.<br /><br />11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.<br /><br />12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.<br /><br />13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.<br /><br />I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.<br /><br />Oooppps - I have just mentioned them.<br /><br />Overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.<br /><br />4/10.","Mickey Rourke is [[bringing]] a renaissance at the moment... and fair [[y]] to him.

"Michelle, Anicée Alvina, was so [[nice]], and I really fall in [[love]] with her. She died a few [[months]] ago! Friends? [[Really]] the [[best]] movie of my youth. The ""seasons reprise"" of Elton and his [[arranger]] Paul Buckmaster sings in my head forever... [[Please]], if you know where i [[could]] [[find]] a VHS of the film, mail me!! [[My]] husband of 26 years & I saw this as Juniors in HS. [[Yes]], he was my boyfriend then and still continues to be. [[I]] [[think]] we both cried our eyes out. I think [[possibly]] we were drawn to the movie by the Elton John music in it, but were then swept away by the teenage [[angst]] of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our [[ages]] when we saw the movie- so very [[easy]] to identify with!! It is wonderful to [[hear]] that Sean is doing well, I am also in the ""helping professions"" (an RN). [[I]] [[thought]] his performance was [[good]] and very believable. ""Michelle"" came across as very [[sweet]], [[fragile]] and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the ""real world"" then they [[could]] be happy and continue to be in love. How many [[times]] have all of us wanted to just have a ""Calgon [[moment]]"". [[If]] we all had no outside worries and [[could]] just deal with our ""basic needs"" it [[could]] be [[somewhat]] easier. I have a 15 yr old daughter and wouldn't have a [[problem]] with her [[seeing]] this movie.. Kids see so [[much]] worse these [[days]] that this is very tame. [[For]] those of you who are [[trying]] to locate the CD my husband (a [[huge]] Elton John fan) was able to get a 2-CD [[set]] which came out in 1992.

[[we]] [[love]] we both cried our eyes out. I think [[indeed]] we were drawn to the movie by the Elton John music in it, but were then swept away by the teenage [[years]] of it all. Paul and Michelle were just about our [[twenties]] when we saw the movie- so very [[quick]] to identify with!! It is wonderful to [[meet]] that Sean is doing well, I am also in the ""helping professions"" (an RN). [[they]] [[said]] his performance was [[fantastic]] and very believable. ""Michelle"" came across as very [[soft]], [[beautiful]] and vulnerable.

"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.<br /><br />Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. I just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. That said, he does get the ""To be, or not to be"" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.<br /><br />The supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius.<br /><br />At four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks. Check it out if you're interested but be prepared for a long watch.","Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character.

"Throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the ""Partisans""  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who's generally only known in Eastern Europe, directed quite a few of these ""partisan"" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the Europe and the United States. ""Battle of the Eagles"" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force.<br /><br />Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.<br /><br />The film opens strongly with a well-shot German air raid on defenseless partisans. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. All of the characters are familiar clichés: Major Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He blasts away at strafing planes with a machine-gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic (""The Battle of Neretva"") is a Zare, a hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic (""Hell River"") is Voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic (""The Day that Shook the World"") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks, eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and Krvavac doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed. The plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the Germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts.<br /><br />Krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and false-looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable. Some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just plain pathetic. Sometimes smoke puffs from the ""machine-guns"" are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. Worse, the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage. Although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective, they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism. All of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by Bojan Adamic.<br /><br />""Battle of the Eagles"" also suffers from a very poorly edited English-language release. To begin with, 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102. The missing segments were carelessly excised, and the cutting looks very sloppy. Music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some badly-needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. Then, there's the dubbing all of the scenes revolving around the Partisans are dubbed in English (rather poorly, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in German, without the benefit of subtitles. The film might have made much more sense had the German-language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the Partisans.<br /><br />On the plus side, Krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well. There is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets. The scenery is fresh and green, and Krvavac isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek. A German ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out, as does a sequence where Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base.<br /><br />As it exists on home video, ""Battle of the Eagles"" is just another of many stories about the Yugoslav Partisan movement. There is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable.

"KRAMER VS KRAMER won [[five]] Oscars, [[including]] Best Picture of 1979.

Robert Benton's [[incisive]] screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, [[souls]], and [[brains]].

"Shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, being imaginative isn't enough, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us.

Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a [[dire]] subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy [[whatsoever]]. It has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast, but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***","Shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, being imaginative isn't enough, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us.

"Early Jackie Chan film where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know. This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China. Its a very serious story that shows [[none]] of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom. Its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short. As a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie. I was watching it, in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that I watched that day had I not noticed Jackie in the film. Honestly I don't think the film is really worth bothering with (there are too many other better variations) except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.","Early Jackie Chan film where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know.

"If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Life was slow then, compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by Gustav Mahler.<br /><br />This movie is slow, there is no [[denying]] it. No special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. No perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.<br /><br />So, basically, nothing much happens in this movie? Not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum. If you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto, this is the movie to do it.","If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it.

"[[Surprisingly]] well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act.

"This film certainly wasn't very [[sophisticated]]. No, the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that I think about it.

"I had [[seen]] [[The]] Cure when [[I]] was a kid and I loved it then. [[Now]], years later, I got a hold of a copy almost by accident, and watched it again. [[Being]] a [[kid]], you don't really have the ability to [[procure]] things for yourself that you want, that is [[usually]] a prerogative of your parents - but when [[I]] watched it again now I felt sorry that [[I]] did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then, and [[consequently]] almost forgot about it until today.<br /><br />[[This]] [[really]] is a beautiful movie. [[It]] [[tells]] the story of the [[unlikely]] friendship between a hard-edged, misfit kid - who [[takes]] his cues from his [[horrible]], abusive mother - and his neighbor, a [[slightly]] [[younger]] boy who has AIDS.<br /><br />[[Right]], you say. Another one of ""those"". A tear [[jerker]]. A bucket movie. A morality tail. Yeah, I know, [[I]] [[hate]] those too. Only this one isn't. It is one of the very few [[movies]] among those many I have [[seen]] that pulls off a very rare trick: it [[conveys]] a [[truly]] sad [[story]] (and yes, a morality [[tale]]) but without a [[single]] moment where it [[feels]] cheesy, forced or in any other way ""hollywoody"". [[It]] shows a REAL relationship between two [[REAL]] boys, who interact as REAL [[kids]] do. And through that interaction the good-natured, loving [[character]] of the older boy, Eric, starts to [[shine]] through his ""tough-guy"" persona, as he takes on a [[kind]] of big-brotherly care for Dexter, his HIV-positive [[younger]] neighbor. Together, they embark on an adventure to [[find]] a cure - which to Erik [[seems]] to be just around the corner - so that all this [[silly]] AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever.<br /><br />The production is top notch. [[But]], of course, what [[really]] carries this movie, is the performances of the two leads - Brad [[Renfro]] and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is simply stunning - he does [[convey]] a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy, but at the same time he [[manages]] to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. [[He]] shines at the scene where the boys [[confront]] Pony: his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth, [[drives]] him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the horror is [[depicted]] on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to Erik as well.<br /><br />I've first seen this film when I was at school back in America, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously, will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the ""official"" after-school specials put together.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless... The score. It's great. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.<br /><br />All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

"Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute [[crowd]] pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his [[latest]] [[animated]] film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off.

I'm [[embarrassed]] to [[say]] the least that I've so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro ([[eyes]] that [[pile]] of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to [[bits]], but I guess this [[would]] serve as a final push for me not to [[continue]] missing what would likely be animated films that [[I]] [[would]] enjoy.<br /><br />Ponyo (voiced by Nara [[Yuria]]) is a magic goldfish that yearns to [[know]] what is life beyond the [[sea]], with her constant forays in a bubble to the [[surface]] of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not [[bode]] well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto (Tokoro [[Joji]]), who harbours some hatred [[toward]] the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a [[subplot]] on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature as well. [[An]] accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore, and [[picked]] up by five year old boy Sosuke (Doi [[Hiroki]]) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa ([[Yamaguchi]] Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is [[mostly]] out to sea [[since]] he's a sailor. [[And]] you can expect some [[moments]] of throwback to the [[likes]] of [[The]] Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. [[Saying]] [[anything]] more would be to spoil the fun.<[[br]] /><br />The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it's in 2D glory, [[knowing]] that each cell is painstakingly worked on. [[There]] are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you'll [[probably]] be game for repeated viewings just to [[spot]] them all. [[This]] definitely beats any 3D or CG [[animated]] production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork [[department]], but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.<br /><br />At its core, its about love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it's about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!<br /><br />Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki.

Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural.

The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features, it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women.

The effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy.<br /><br />There are of course some redeeming moments of gore (that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven(!) of a woman who just won't quit life, even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club, and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features, it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women. The black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general. In the end, Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.",0.017123401165008545,0.02211529016494751,0,0,0,1155,"Failed"

"I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that? Apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' this Jean Renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero. In the year 2028, following a great war, Africa has become the most civilised region on Earth, and what was formerly Europe has been designated ""Terres Inconnues (Unknown Land)."" An African explorer  played by Johnny Huggins, a Black man dressed up as a White man dressed up as a Black man, if you follow me  travels to the ruins of Paris in his spherical aircraft, and lands outside the lair of a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then the director's wife) and her primate companion, perhaps the creepiest ape-man costume I've ever seen. The savage, as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual, starts showing the explorer the Charleston dance, which he is delighted to learn himself.<br /><br />It doesn't help the film that Hessling, who was wonderful the following year in Renoir's 'The Little Match Girl (1928),' isn't much of a dancer, though the extensive use of slow-motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Furthermore, I'm quite shocked that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later! On the plus side, I did like the general sci-fi concept behind the film, and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this. However, why Renoir decided to dress up his Black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time. Silly, crude and quite pointless, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors, and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised with a selection of pieces from Dmitri Shostakovich.","I enjoy science-fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that?

"First love. Teenage love. We all have experienced it [[even]] if it was not as sweet as the one the protagonists share. ""Friends"" could be considered an adaptation of the classic ""The Blue Lagoon"", originally from 1949, and its remakes from 1980 (the most popular one, with Brooke Shields) and 1999 (with a young Milla Jovovich). While ""The Blue Lagoon"" puts the two young lovers in a desert island, with no contact with civilization, ""Friends"" goes the opposite route and it is [[sure]] to ring much more true and be a more [[difficult]] movie with contemporary audiences. Paul and Michelle who, for different reasons, turn their backs on family and the adult world to end up living together in a small cottage in Southern France. [[Having]] only each other and their childhood innocence, their friendship slowly develops into much more as they struggle to sustain themselves, in this [[sweet]] coming of age story. This film even to this [[day]] is controversial since the actors are [[teenagers]] and they certainly look the ages that are stated in the movie (15 and 14 1/2). The movie does contains a hint of child molesting, nudity, depictions of teenage sex and teenage pregnancy. [[But]] the real controversy is not the subject matter but the [[fact]] that Paul and Michelle's love is presented as a natural and healthy relationship. While this worked fine for stranded lovers in another time and in a desert island, having them in a modern setting presents some very [[difficult]] moral issues. Laws [[prohibiting]] consenting sex between minors are in effect in almost all countries and lack of sexual education in teenagers is seen as one of the causes for the rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Is a movie like this one just child pornography or a slap in the face to make us face our own hypocrisy, regarding a modern society that does not cater to teenage parents and laws that clearly go against human nature and hormonal development but that are needed to [[prevent]] child abuse? Is hormonal development parallel to emotional growth? These are not easy questions and most of us will [[feel]] uncomfortable with them. As an artistic piece, this movie is really a forgotten and rough gem. [[The]] script progresses with extreme simplicity, albeit some sappiness, but [[never]] pulling any punches to state its message, although by today standards, it is [[somewhat]] slow. The photography is [[beautiful]] and it has scenes of [[great]] beauty. The acting of the two protagonists [[varies]] from really awful in some scenes to [[marvelously]] innocent and credible in others. Pop music, unlike most productions nowadays, is used tastefully and sometimes the lyrics speak the thoughts of the protagonists. Overall, this is a delightful piece, even if the moral values are not in concordance with your own.","First love. Teenage love.

"First i will say that i am going to be as subjective as I can.<br /><br />There will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.<br /><br />I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based off the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for the [[ps1]] has been in the works for quite some time. After the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really [[excited]] about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. So i had thought to myself, ""WHAT COULD GO [[WRONG]]?"".<br /><br />Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of [[hand]] as the movie progressed. Without a doubt, this is the best looking CGI animation around, but that won't [[help]] a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over [[indulgent]] action scenes. <br /><br />Here is the story basically. These three silver [[haired]] nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are [[supposedly]] clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) They also center some of the story on some kid named Denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small [[amounts]] of skin [[discoloration]].<br /><br />So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. [[Apparently]] Cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. The real [[problem]] of this movie is logic. Now i know what you are gonna say, ""But it's called Final FANTASY! it should have those ideas in it!"" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.<br /><br />Also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. They show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.<br /><br />If this is too long here is the simpler review-<br /><br />the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning<br /><br />the cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible ending<br /><br />BIG TIME SPOILER-<br /><br />Now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.<br /><br />not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.<br /><br />other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.","First i will say that i am going to be as subjective as I can.<br /><br />There will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.<br /><br />I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review.

So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small [[kind]] of skin [[changes]].<br /><br />So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. [[also]] Cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. The real [[trouble]] of this movie is logic. Now i know what you are gonna say, ""But it's called Final FANTASY! it should have those ideas in it!"" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.<br /><br />Also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. They show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.<br /><br />If this is too long here is the simpler review-<br /><br />the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning<br /><br />the cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible ending<br /><br />BIG TIME SPOILER-<br /><br />Now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.<br /><br />not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.<br /><br />other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.",0.04254370927810669,0.535132646560669,0,1,0,640,"Successful"

"In order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this!<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. It is well acted, if a bit slow moving, and the camera work and Portland scenes are exquisite for a low-budget, unpretentious picture. The dialog is very good. <br /><br />Mason is seriously withdrawn youth who works at a telemarketing company selling insurance. His high school buddy, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that Mason is quite obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares which send him gasping and fumbling for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a perky, pretty girl named Amber and he sketches her in his notebook. She takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from his withdrawn state, almost becoming halfway human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She becomes frightened and pulls away. We are wondering if her sudden coldness is going to push him over the edge. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /><br />This is the setup for the revelation. In order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong I have to explain what happens. *Another spoiler warning!* In order for this plot to work we have believe that Amber, a really outgoing, pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who, at least at the beginning of their friendship, has a vacant stare and can only speak in monosyllables or doesn't speak at all. He's way beyond nerdy, he appears on the verge of total catatonia. Yes I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of evil manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there at all. Any perky young thing would cross the street to avoid him. It is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him. Moreover there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge the crazy Mason, that just isn't believable either. <br /><br />But wait, there's a revelation. Amber fails to show up at Berkeley's house for Christmas dinner where Mason is expecting her and Berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, don't exist at all! She and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. <br /><br />Well, this explains why a normal cute Amber would go for Mason, she's just a figment of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, it's not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there...he's enraged, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was in fact real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /><br />In the end, after being given proof that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been halfway sane from the beginning, but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. We suspected what he was all along and can't understand why Berkeley couldn't see it. But then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real, why Amber would be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /><br />To make the ending worse, we are never given to understand whether all the other of Mason's girlfriends, the ones in the sketchbooks, were real or was Amber the first real one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /><br />The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. Perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story, but this movie is not that.","In order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some *spoilers* so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised, don't read this!<br /><br />I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential.

Moreover there is no credible reason for Berkeley to indulge the crazy Mason, that just isn't believable either. <br /><br />But wait, there's a revelation. Amber fails to show up at Berkeley's house for Christmas dinner where Mason is expecting her and Berkeley, his old buddy, has to tell him that Amber and all his other former girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, don't exist at all! She and all the others are merely figments of his twisted imagination: he dreamed them up. <br /><br />Well, this explains why a normal cute Amber would go for Mason, she's just a figment of his imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper preparation and setup, but alas, it's not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there...he's enraged, he kills her. But now we are given to understand that Amber was in fact real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /><br />In the end, after being given proof that Amber actually exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. This would work if Mason had been halfway sane from the beginning, but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us. We suspected what he was all along and can't understand why Berkeley couldn't see it. But then we are once again left to wonder: if she was real, why Amber would be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /><br />To make the ending worse, we are never given to understand whether all the other of Mason's girlfriends, the ones in the sketchbooks, were real or was Amber the first real one? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /><br />The problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material. Perhaps there could have been a way to straighten it out and tell a credible suspense story, but this movie is not that.",0.5721791982650757,0.5721791982650757,1,1,0,1,"Skipped"

"[[This]] groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. I went into the screening at the convention in Indiana with very low expectations, having already viewed 2 other film with ""gamer"" in the title (both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one I had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits ""Dorkness"" had me. The temperate Northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master, Lodge(powerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice) and his misfit band of friends who set aside the real-life dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting Lodge provides for them. After the first scene(set in the fantasy world they inhabit) They are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape. This drew so many comparisons to my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice's acting is of such amazing caliber that I truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty-something male suffering from frustration, [[male]] pattern baldness and an annoying group of ""friends"" that can't seem to grasp concepts [[like]] [[right]] and wrong. Lodge's friends are of some note here: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, aside from lodge. Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary, the youngest of the group. This seems only slightly odd at [[first]] until you realize that Gary is, in [[fact]], a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects [[outside]] his ""fantasy"" world. [[This]] dichotomy serves, not to [[confuse]], but to [[inform]] and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. [[My]] only complaint about this is that the [[actors]] who portray Leo (Scott C. Brown) and [[Gary]] (christian Doyle) seem to play the characters for laughs at [[times]], as [[though]] they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard-hitting action/drama. [[Speaking]] of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as [[Cass]], the third and most [[influential]] member of Lodge's motley crew. the tension is always [[high]] when he is on screen, both when he is arguing [[passionately]] about his beliefs to Lodge or when [[displaying]] his [[fantastic]] Martial [[Arts]] skills as ""Silence"" his fantasy character. Or [[even]] when he turns [[around]] suddenly to face the audience and you [[reflexively]] duck in the audience so as not to [[get]] smacked by his fantastic chin. Lewis Lights up the screen no matter what he's doing and I hope to see more of him in the future. Once the action begins in this movie, it just doesn't quit. the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you can's tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment. Truly a thrill ride of Epic proportions, I would recommend ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"" as required viewing for anyone who loves film.

The wogs always win of course, because they apparently lift weights and have ""respect"".

"Just [[lovely]]. It is long. No climax. Don't wait for anything to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the Greek isles.

Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place. There are no phones, no TV, boredom, which when hit with quietness like that, the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect. And each character does so. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with John Cassavetes' character, but he is unable to, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage. He is demanding and frustrating to everyone. There is another character in the movie, a Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex, but things that she is curious about.

"Out of the handful of alternative titles in English, ""The Sexorcist"" is definitely the most appropriate one, since this is basically just a shameless [[rip]] off of William Friedkin's classic horror film in which they replaced 13-year-old Linda Blair with the 19-year-old Stella Carnacina only so that she could gratuitously show her ravishing naked body. I'm not sure what exactly Satan tries to accomplish here, but he exclusively seems to possess the young girl to play sexual tricks on her! [[Poor]] Danila masturbates around the clock and tries to seduce priests and even her own father into having sex with her. The young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology-student with an odd-looking boyfriend (driving a stupid yellow car) and loving, albeit adulterous parents. When she takes a peculiar crucifix home to renovate, the ancient relic comes to life and no less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of ""Jungle Holocaust"" and ""Planet of the Vampires"") starts to torment her. The overlong masturbation sessions and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the movie, and then finally director Mario Garriazzo begins with the actual exorcism. That final segment is even more [[embarrassing]] and amateurish! The priests don't really do anything apart from saying some vague prayers but, somehow, Danila seems cured all of a sudden. There isn't much gore, the dialogues are [[horrible]] and the producers seem to compensate every little flaw by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the seventies (why the hell are they referring to ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""?), but definitely not one of the best.

We have the ""worn-out cop on the edge"" so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie; we have the old one-day-away-from-retirement-cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside, since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a trustworthy word throughout the movie. About as see-through as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history (they could've just called him Marcellus Wallace), but just slightly tougher and more ruthless, because something has to emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne from actually good movies.

It does offer one unique trait, which is this: It leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. Which would be great, if you actually cared about any of these people. Instead I found myself yelling at the screen, weeping like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or my own death. The cab driver himself (though well played, considering) runs through emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic. Sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake. ""Dammit, I learned all these emotions in acting class, and I'm gonna use them!"" Now that I've been thinking about it again, I do hate this movie as much as I did!",0.061560630798339844,0.5316142439842224,0,1,0,208,"Successful"

"I hate films about sports. I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. Use exhibit ""A""  ""The Game Plan"" as evidence of this if you want. So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey"". I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my [[first]] viewing, I thought that history couldn't be [[fully]] recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was [[intense]], it matched well Peralta had [[made]] a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our [[nation]] with a [[great]] score to the settlers just rowing their boats all [[day]]. I wanted to know the men [[behind]] the myths.<br /><br />Then, with a thought that I [[would]] have another negative review under my belt, I [[watched]] the film again with Peralta's audio commentary. [[His]] [[passion]], his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me. [[This]] suddenly [[transformed]] into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets [[us]] know more of where these kids are today, what they are [[still]] doing, and how difficult it was to [[get]] some of them onto the camera. [[He]] hadn't [[seen]] many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges [[brought]] the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much [[dedication]] to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.<br /><br />Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again  they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time. I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming  the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.<br /><br />Grade: *** ½ out of *****","I hate films about sports.

"Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldn't help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the ""performers"" featured here. Stumbling around naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was capable of in this feature--a huge and heartbreaking contrast from Flesh. His semi-erection in a few scenes is the only indication that he might be acting; mostly it looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation all right--she is the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a one woman show--she rarely engages the other performers though, it has to be said, her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematic displays of raw passion. When she pounces on a young, would-be lover it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female performers, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices you'll have to mute the sound to get through their scenes. The fact that several of these performers committed suicide or were murdered a few years after only adds to the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get in front of Morrissey's camera anyway. There probably isn't a worse way to spend a Saturday night but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life.","Quite liked Flesh and looking forward to Heat but couldn't help but feel Morrissey grossly exploited most of the ""performers"" featured here.

"While the ""date doctor"" concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, I found it [[enjoyable]] [[enough]] to elevate my opinion of it so I ended up liking it a lot more than if it'd had just a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, acting as Hitch, the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over women...ever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend. There're plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient, overweight, gawky asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) successfully court beautiful co-worker Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to rid a woman he meets in a bar of the turkey who just doesn't seem to get she doesn't want him around, he finds himself attracted to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it appears to be a big deal for him, so I guess since college he never actually practiced his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip columnist who is interested in ""the date doctor"" who got a seemingly dorky guy like [[Albert]] together with Allegra - especially AFTER player/jerk Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks her best friend's (Julie Ann Emery) heart and hints the date doctor he saw disgusted him, when she doesn't realize that he refused to see him. Still, trouble follows and Hitch is stuck left wondering about what to do with his own relationship, while not being any great help to Albert when he tries to figure out what more to do in his. The acting is [[good]], there's a great deal of humor and some other fine points with meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes managing to be both at once. True, the misunderstanding where the woman is affronted at something the man hasn't truly done (why do they always show that?) as common and irritating - guess it wouldn't have been if it was the 1st, not 5th, time I've seen IT - but the rest of them were completely new. I only wish this movie was longer - I remember being able to watch 3/5 of it while it was playing on a restaurant's TV once - but I still approve.

"I [[watched]] this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. [[Prue]], Piper, and Phoebe try and save their innocent,A Doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. [[Phoebe]] goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall, same with Piper. So Phoebe comes downstairs and says the spell, since it was only [[Phoebe]] who said it and not the power of three Shax only got wounded. [[Phoebes]] calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. [[Phoebe]] went into the Underworld to find Cole, meanwhile Prue and Piper are looking for Shax in the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper uses her Power to Blow up Shax, meanwhile a New reporter got it all on tape. So its all over the new about the three powerful [[Halliwell]] sisters, meanwhile [[Phoebe]] doesn't know anything because she is still in the Underworld. There's Repoters and people all over the Halliwell house. Then a maniac comes in the house and says ""Can I be Part Of Your Coven?"" and Prue says ""No this is our house get out of here!"" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. As the maniac come out of the house crying saying ""There Mean Witches"". The maniac gets so mad that she shoots Piper right through the stomach. Prue get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through ,so Prue uses her powers to move people out of the way, [[making]] people wanna kill her more. They got to the hospital but Piper didn't make it. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the Underworld.Phoebe finds out that they have been exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse time.The Source says he will only reverse time if Phoebe promises to stay here in The Underworld, so Cole told [[Phoebe]] what the source told him.

Leo goes to the hospital to find out the Piper really is dead so he tells Phoebe that its true.

"What a [[fine]] film!

(Robert Young's account of prejudice against his grandfather who was Irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was pretty lame, but the times dictated that the film avoid a further examination of racism.) <br /><br />I do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer: 1. Did you notice that Robert Young didn't aim his gun when he shot and killed Robert Ryan who was running fast in the dark and Young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming? 2. If Robert Young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 (the film was made in 1947) and Young was 40 years old, the time line would not be logical.

See it to go back to that great, great space in time when metal wasn't just a part of life, it WAS life-and for those non rock fans-see it to get a little glimpse into a life that meant and still means so much to so many of us.",0.030483901500701904,0.5076483488082886,1,0,1,1047,"Successful"

"Hello - I normally love movies. I'm 19, I have seen many and dislike only one or two. This one though, the second it finished, I had to pull my sister (who had wanted to see it) out by the arm and I burst into tears of laughter as soon as I got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. <br /><br />Why it was awful: - all the cows had udders, especially bothersome were the MALE ones with udders - none of the characters were unique or engaging, except perhaps the main Coyote Dag - the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous - the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out-do the last one - the themes of working together, which should have been present at the end, were nonexistent. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I'll take this all upon myself, and in this case I was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge - all the moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were beyond corniness, even for a kid's movie<br /><br />and...the [[worst]] of all... IT PARALLELS THE LION KING IN EVERY SINGLE WAY Responsible father figure who is killed by Coyotes (the Coyotes are essentially the Hyenas, with Dag, the lead Coyote, being the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, though basically Simba) wants to play around, and is shocked that his dad died, believes it was his fault (even though in this movie, it WAS his fault), confronts the Coyotes and gets an ass whooping, after which Dag tells him to leave, and on the verge of leaving, Odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up (by complete surprise of course, he leaves without knowing they will come help him). <br /><br />Other things taken from Lion King: stars moving around as signs, father figures referring to stars/signs in a mystical loving way, the obviously circularness of how the father Ben found Odis and took care of him, and how at the end Odis' love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. Birth at the end? GOOD [[GOD]], what the hell... and even similar type music, which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music.<br /><br />Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever seen where I really WAS rooting for the bad guys - I never understood what other people were saying, until now.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your time to go see this. Convince the kids not to see it, and re-watch the Lion King. Either that, or take them to see the Ant Bully, which was creative and artistic.","Hello - I normally love movies.

You don't have to be a fan of Westerns to like this one. For one thing, Johnson and Carey are two of the most quickly likable characters you'll see in any movie.

It should be mentioned that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, both with many years' experience riding, roping, and doing all manner of cowboy-type things. Carey grew up on a ranch where his family employed many Navaho Indians and in fact he learned to speak Navaho before he learned to speak English. No rhinestone cowboys in this movie - ""Travis"" and ""Sandy"" were the real thing through and through.<br /><br />Watch for the scene when Miss Denver throws out the pan of water from her wagon, hitting Travis's horse in the face... the horse starts bucking, eventually throwing him off it. Watch the look on Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis 'I'm sorry you fell off your horse.' Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) gets into a bit of a tiff with one of the Mormons. They're working back to back getting their gear ready, and after Sandy gets disgusted with the other fellow, the two of them get into a rear-end bumping match that quickly turns into a rolling-around-on-the-ground fist fight. Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) stands them up and separates them, the two combatants continue trying to get at each other. The Mormon (named 'Jackson' in the film) gets one final kick in at Sandy so high it hits his shoulder. It's a really funny scene from start to finish. <br /><br />I don't know what else I can say about this movie other than that it has a good story, very engaging characters, beautiful scenery and plenty of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama.

"Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao [[Miyazaki]], is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for [[humans]] young and old, and respect for cultural differences. [[It]] is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, [[rather]] than a retelling of Disney's Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by [[hand]], a whimsical, magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. The film [[begins]] with a slow [[undulating]] blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and [[scores]] of [[little]] fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. There isn't any [[need]] for narrative, the motion of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the [[beginning]]. [[Released]] last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy's [[award]] for Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.[[com]]). The [[fanciful]] little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon [[reaching]] the surface she is [[caught]] up in a fishing net full of other fish, [[garbage]], and sludge. She is propelled into a jar, which is rolled to [[shore]] where five-year-old Sosuke (voice by Frankie Jonas) retrieves it. He [[cuts]] his hand when breaking the jar open to [[free]] the [[little]] goldfish. Brunhild tastes his blood, which heals Sosuke's [[cut]], and puts in motion her transformation to a human, at the same time [[throwing]] nature out of balance. Sosuke [[puts]] the little goldfish in a [[green]] pail and names her Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), meaning [[soft]] and jelly like. Sosuke's [[mother]], Lisa (Tina Fey), [[lets]] him take Ponyo to school, which is [[right]] next door to the nursing home where she works. Lisa's [[crazy]] driving down the picturesque winding road, past a [[dry]] dock, through the bustling fishing town, and up a tree-lined [[road]] to the nursing home is representative of Miyazaki's wonderful [[sequence]] of action and illustrates perfectly a parent's hectic [[morning]]. Miyazaki has created another strong, independent, female [[character]] in Lisa. Making her a loving, sensible, modern mother both to [[Sosuke]] and Ponyo. Lisa's telephone conversation with the not-coming-home-again [[husband]], Kiochi (Matt Damon) because the ship he captains [[must]] [[make]] another run, is a typical wife's reaction. Later that [[evening]] Sosuke intercedes using a signal lamp to speak to his father as the ship passes the cliff their house sits on. Lisa refuses to acknowledge Kiochi's apology and jumps up and signals ""Bug-off, Bug-off, Bug-off,"" it is a hilarious scene. But, when Sosuke takes the signal lamp and tells his dad ""Good Luck, Love You,"" Lisa hugs him and tells him he has a good heart, it is a very poignant scene.<br /><br />My personal favorites are Miyazaki's elderly, granny-type women in wheelchairs at the nursing home, Yochi (Betty White), Noriko (Cloris Leachman) and Toki (Lily Tomlin). Their interchange over Sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful and reminiscent of the bickering between the Witch of the Waste (Lauren Bacall) and Sophie (Jean Simmons) as they trudge up a long flight of stairs in Howl's Moving Castle. Ponyo's magical sea-god father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson) resembling the wizard Howl arrives to take Ponyo back to her ocean home. Fujimoto uses one of his elixirs to try and put nature back in balance, but magical little Ponyo escapes again upsetting more elixir in the process, and causing a tsunami. Running on the backs of giant dolphins to get to Sosuke, this redheaded, little girl reminds the audience of the stubborn, adventurous little Mei in My Neighbor Totoro. Ponyo is just as adventurous and curious as Mei. When Fujimoto realizes what Ponyo has done he calls for Gran Mamare (Kate Blanchett), the Goddess of the ocean, to help with the situation. This wise, calming Goddess arrives in a blue flowing garment that never ends. She has a private talk with Lisa discussing the future of the young children, which helps the audience understand Sosuke and Ponyo's relationship is not that of lovers, but of brother and sister. The life-goes-on quiet simple ending is typical of Miyazaki films leaving the audience full of hope.","Ponyo, written and directed by Hayao [[hiroshi]], is a little tale that speaks of respect for the ocean, respect for [[generations]] young and old, and respect for cultural differences. [[they]] is a new tale of a little goldfish wishing to be a girl, [[differently]] than a retelling of Disney's Little Mermaid. Miyazaki has animated by [[hearts]], a whimsical, magical film for the young and the young-at- heart. The film [[connects]] with a slow [[shimmering]] blue-green palette of sea anemones, jellyfish, and [[shades]] of [[beautiful]] fanciful goldfish with childlike faces. There isn't any [[lack]] for narrative, the motion of the creatures and the music of Jo Hisaiahi tell the [[world]]. [[beginning]] last summer in Japan, Ponyo won the Japanese Academy's [[oscar]] for Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel.[[ca]]). The [[sweet]] little goldfish, Brunhild, leaves her ocean home on a jellyfish. Upon [[leaving]] the surface she is [[catching]] up in a fishing net full of other fish, [[bait]], and sludge. She is propelled into a jar, which is rolled to [[sea]] where five-year-old Sosuke (voice by Frankie Jonas) retrieves it.

War is horrifying, bloody, destructive. [[It]] is [[also]] murderous on the psyche. However, what is fundamental about ""Fires on the Plain"" is its unapologetic [[look]] at the Japanese soldiers. It shows them slowly [[collapsing]] under the weight of superior American firepower and their nation's [[inability]] to wage a war of its own making. A fatalistic code encouraging [[death]] before surrender is at the heart of this [[madness]].<[[br]] /><br />I was astonished to [[see]] such an honest and brutally close look at the [[bitter]] fruits of Japan's military misadventure made just 14 years after the [[end]] of what the Japanese call the ""Great Pacific [[War]]."" Ichikawa, [[reveals]] what the Germans called the ""war life,"" the [[plight]] of the common soldier.<br /><br />Ichikawa's film is [[interesting]], [[since]] even today Japan is having a hard [[time]] fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism, its [[subjugation]] of conquered peoples, the racism of its [[war]] against the Chinese and war crimes which [[included]] cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against [[one]] another, but against Allied prisoners of war.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Ichikawa produces a stark representation of the [[victimization]] of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural [[pressures]].<br /><br />This stark examination is skillfully [[done]] by portraying the doomed soldiers as human [[beings]] who exhibit, at [[various]] times, fear, brilliantly laconic humor, dialog enriched by its sparseness, and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim, wilderness setting.<br /><br />Ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men. The tubercular Tamura, played as a woebegone and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi, is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity, though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades. Before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy, Tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who, recognizing the hopelessness of their situation, advises Tamura to kill himself.<br /><br />Why Tamura's hopelessly ill-supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling. Ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation, he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter. They appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave.<br /><br />We later watch as the overworked hospital's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all-consuming American artillery barrage. The pathetic patients, who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive, appear like pathetic, serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force. You know they won't survive.<br /><br />Ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. As Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte we encounter the noble, the dying and the exploitive. Cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to American ""corned beef.""<br /><br />When the men do talk of surrender, the propaganda of how Americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly-wise soldier who reveals that the approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they, unlike the Japanese, respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up.<br /><br />It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the Emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning. Those willing to fight to the death will be killed. It is the calculus of war.<br /><br />After shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade, whom he earlier offered his own body to as food, the fatalistic Tamura's careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Was Ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live, but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes?<br /><br />If someone watches this film carefully, he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power -- a lesson that transformed Japanese postwar society. Ichikawa's film isn't so shallow that it indicts America. Ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost.<br /><br />Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
