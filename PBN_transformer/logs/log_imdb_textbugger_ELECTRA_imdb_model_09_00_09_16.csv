"One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card. Whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room I was working in, and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the tape.<br /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the far wall was a coat rack. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said ""I've seen enough."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? Nope, sorry. Next! That's how long you've got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.<br /><br />I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this [[piece]] of [[crap]]. After an [[interminably]] long [[travelogue]] of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is [[boring]]! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men -<br /><br />- and the director crosses the line.<br /><br />The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. Audiences don't like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. Audiences love all of those. Confused? No. You loose them. They walk out. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those things they pound into you at film school, or should. It's basic stuff. It's not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.<br /><br />I thought, ""I've seen enough"".

"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly [[neglected]].

"The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the [[latest]] in a [[string]] of terribly [[disappointing]] Hollywood [[remakes]] that fall flat on their face [[despite]] extravagant special effects. <br /><[[br]] />What a [[lousy]], uninspired [[bland]] story, with no imagination. Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful [[sci-fi]] classic? Are [[today's]] [[movie]] audiences too hip for the H.G. [[Wells]] writing largely as is? [[The]] [[1960]] [[George]] Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with [[clunky]] [[low-budget]] effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that [[looked]] [[like]] Smurfs on [[steroids]].<[[br]] /><br />The [[2002]] version must have H.G [[Wells]] turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the [[time]] traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a [[time]] paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the [[1960]] version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the [[whole]] movie [[dour]]. [[If]] Guy [[Pearce's]] character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the [[time]] [[paradox]] dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,[[000]] yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 [[version]]?<[[br]] /><br />2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. [[The]] [[George]] Pal [[film]] carefully explains the whole weird idea of '[[travel']] [[though]] a 4th dimension.<br /><[[br]] />[[3]]. [[The]] director goes out of his way to make [[Pearce's]] character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the [[1960]] version [[Rod]] Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and [[charming]].<br /><br />4. Among the key themes of the [[60's]] version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the [[idea]] that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity.

Why so totally rewrite such a wonderful [[sic-fi]] classic? Are [[todaу's]] [[moviе]] audiences too hip for the H.G. [[Wellѕ]] writing largely as is? [[Te]] [[1৭60]] [[Geoⲅge]] Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with [[cunky]] [[low-budge𝚝]] effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that [[lookeԁ]] [[li𝒌e]] Smurfs on [[steroіds]].<[[bⲅ]] /><br />The [[202]] version must have H.G [[Wellѕ]] turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the [[tіme]] traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a [[tie]] paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the [[190]] version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the [[whoⅼe]] movie [[duor]]. [[I𝚏]] Guy [[Pearϲe's]] character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the [[tie]] [[paraԁox]] dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,[[00O]] yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 [[verѕion]]?<[[bⲅ]] /><br />2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. [[Te]] [[Georɡe]] Pal [[fi]] [[lm]] carefully explains the whole weird idea of '[[trɑvel']] [[𝚝hough]] a 4th dimension.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />[[Ʒ]]. [[Te]] director goes out of his way to make [[Peɑrce's]] character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the [[19б0]] version [[Rd]] Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and [[charmnig]].<br /><br />4. Among the key themes of the [[6'0s]] version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the [[ideɑ]] that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy.

"It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an [[overstatement]], though they are still both pretty [[poor]] films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever seen before!!

The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime.

"I've seen a few of Mr. Boorman's movies and didn't like much of them. Not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content I personally found entertaining.

He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske).

"[[Never]] mind if 'National [[Velvet]] (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and [[occasionally]] unconvincing, Clarence [[Brown's]] equestrian [[fable]] is an endearing and very likable [[story]] with a [[good]] [[moral]]. [[After]] achieving modest success through her appearance in '[[Lassie]] Come [[Home]] ([[1943]]),' young Elizabeth Taylor, age [[12]], landed her first leading [[role]] as Velvet [[Brown]], a [[passionate]] schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though [[filmed]] in California, the [[story]] - adapted from a novel by [[Enid]] Bagnold - is set in a [[small]] township on the [[English]] countryside, and [[full]] advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and [[handsome]] landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. [[Mickey]] Rooney [[takes]] top billing as Mi Taylor, a [[misguided]] ex-jockey with devious intentions, [[whose]] relationship with [[young]] Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a [[new]], [[optimistic]] chapter in his [[life]]. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he [[must]] confess the [[traumatic]] experience that led to his fear of horses, Rooney is [[enjoyable]] as the surly but [[passionate]] young man who [[must]] prove his [[worth]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />It is perhaps a good thing that [[Elizabeth]] Taylor had those [[entrancing]] [[violet]] eyes, because her acting abilities, at this [[young]] age, were rather limited. Her more [[emotional]] sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the [[face]] of [[adversity]], strike one as being [[rather]] hollow, and the [[touchingly-naive]] notion that [[simply]] ""believing"" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film [[ever]] made. [[Nevertheless]], Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she [[works]] well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a [[child-star]]. Anne Revere [[plays]] a very [[important]] [[role]] as [[Velvet's]] mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I [[liked]] that [[Mi]] was not told about this until the [[film's]] final seconds, with [[Mrs]].

Under the guise of a Latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those [[nerve-racking]] pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same.

"I [[can't]] believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and [[I'm]] never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from [[reading]] Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest [[docs]] meant that this film just [[got]] more and more [[ridiculous]] as it went on. There is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"", I was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate [[man-vs-nature]] odyssey. [[Instead]] you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no acclimatisation; climbing with goggles off in full sun, and they are barely ever out of breath performing miraculous feats of endurance. Only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as an [[afterthought]]. If you have no knowledge of [[mountaineering]], give it a look: be prepared for some clichéd heroics (although no more [[clichéd]] than a hundred other passably diverting flicks), and a [[clichéd]] [[outcome]].

"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in titled ""Scarecrow gone wild"" could bring me back, so here I am.<br /><br />With that being said, I like to start off with this comment. [[OUCH]]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [[This]] movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad. But I had no idea that I would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what I thought was a horror movie.<br /><br />Let's start with the biggest [[flaw]] of the film (to me that is). [[Ken]] Shamrock. Now if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. Now if memory serves me again, he was also in this [[stupid]] [[movie]] being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it looked to me). I mean how else do you explain all of his lines. My all time favorite line of his in this so [[called]] [[movie]] was ""It's been a long time coming"". OK????????? The funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam [[scarecrow]] could not be killed. So if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it (the [[scarecrow]] that it). Like I said before, he must have been the [[comic]] [[relief]], [[except]] I don't think his [[UFC]] buddies where [[laughing]].<br /><[[br]] />Now that [[I've]] finished that [[well]] [[deserved]] paragraph on to the [[movie]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />I'll admit that I can't [[remember]] a lot of scenes, and that's not good [[considering]] that I just watch the movie no more then [[fifteen]] minutes [[ago]]. So what [[I'm]] going to do is [[list]] the [[top]] five things [[wrong]] with this film 1. [[Usually]] when [[horror]] movie monster have their own [[theme]] [[music]], it's not heard by the victims or [[even]] by the monster itself. So why were just about every person involved in this movie [[able]] to here this [[pathetic]] whistling. I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl [[running]] in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one [[guy]] starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it.

"Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case, [[I'd]] recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British/[[Spanish]] alliance will [[start]] to crumble and [[things]] will [[turn]] [[around]] again. [[When]] the Spanish nobles [[come]] to Wellington crying for [[Sharpe's]] blood [[though]], the [[English]] general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and [[soon]], he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as [[well]], there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the [[way]], fancy that.<[[br]] /><br />What this results in of course is a more [[adventure]] style approach. The [[concentration]] is [[less]] on the workings of the English military with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, hob nobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby.<br /><br />This slightly [[different]] approach [[makes]] for an intriguing episode but is only a [[good]] [[thing]] in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the [[climax]] fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a [[fantastic]] successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.","Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case, [[I'ԁ]] recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British/[[Spaniѕh]] alliance will [[star𝚝]] to crumble and [[thingѕ]] will [[tuⲅn]] [[arounԁ]] again. [[Whеn]] the Spanish nobles [[coｍe]] to Wellington crying for [[Sharpe'ѕ]] blood [[𝚝hough]], the [[Engliѕh]] general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and [[ѕoon]], he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as [[welⅼ]], there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the [[ԝay]], fancy that.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />What this results in of course is a more [[adventuⲅe]] style approach. The [[ϲoncentration]] is [[lesѕ]] on the workings of the English military with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, hob nobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby.<br /><br />This slightly [[differen𝚝]] approach [[makeѕ]] for an intriguing episode but is only a [[gоod]] [[thinɡ]] in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the [[cl]] [[imax]] fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a [[fɑntastic]] successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.",0.042855799198150635,0.507013201713562,1,0,1,648,"Successful"

"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they [[know]] they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to [[hot]], raunchy blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time. And, my goodness, is the sound track hot.","I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan.

"In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer.

Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the [[corporeal]] biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like [[French]] existentialist [[philosopher]] Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, ""Den Brysomme mannen"" makes normal human interaction look like [[deadpan]] comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

"After repeatedly saying how [[brilliant]] so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. ""Etude In Black"" is not [[100]] percent [[perfect]], but it's certainly more than 90 percent...[[maybe]] 96 or 97! <br /><br />[[Last]] [[week]] I reviewed ""Just [[Married]]"" and compared it unfavourably to ""Meet The Parents"". Well here's [[one]] of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor [[Alex]] Benedict, played by the legend that is John [[Cassavetes]]. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his [[first]] affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it'd be such a [[smart]] move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<[[br]] /><br />Enter Columbo and [[guess]] what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't [[take]] much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and [[soon]] he's following him around wherever he goes. [[Even]] though Columbo is [[certain]] Alex is his man, it [[actually]] [[takes]] quite a while and a few [[false]] leads (none of which [[Columbo]] really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some [[top-notch]] [[extra]] characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English [[mechanic]] who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the [[bedraggled]] looking brass [[player]] who nearly [[finds]] himself fitted up for the murder (he had [[also]] been [[seeing]] Jennifer [[Wells]], the [[busy]] girl!). And [[there's]] even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the [[Police]] [[Academy]] films. [[As]] with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I [[bet]] you're thinking of that [[speech]] he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <[[br]] /><br />But it's Blythe [[Danner]], John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<[[br]] /><br />[[As]] for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. [[But]] this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of ""Etude In Black"" just how [[well]] the pair worked together!","After repeatedly saying how [[briⅼliant]] so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points.

[[Eevn]] though Columbo is [[cretain]] Alex is his man, it [[actuɑlly]] [[takeѕ]] quite a while and a few [[fal]] [[se]] leads (none of which [[Colսmbo]] really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some [[tоp-notch]] [[extⲅa]] characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English [[mehcanic]] who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the [[bedragled]] looking brass [[playeⲅ]] who nearly [[findѕ]] himself fitted up for the murder (he had [[alѕo]] been [[ѕeeing]] Jennifer [[Wlels]], the [[bսsy]] girl!). And [[there'ѕ]] even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the [[Poliϲe]] [[Academу]] films. [[Aѕ]] with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I [[bt]] you're thinking of that [[speeϲh]] he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <[[bⲅ]] /><br />But it's Blythe [[Danenr]], John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />[[Aѕ]] for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. [[B]] [[ut]] this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of ""Etude In Black"" just how [[w]] [[ell]] the pair worked together!",0.04083871841430664,0.631381094455719,1,0,1,2187,"Successful"
"I am a [[glutton]] for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This [[film]], made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail.

"A film that [[reveals]] the [[unease]] of modern men and women in life when confronted to [[death]]. We are [[beyond]] the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any [[kind]] of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. [[What's]] more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and [[irreversibly]] reachable. Post modernism had not reached Hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not [[surprising]]. It [[reactivates]] old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. One has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death [[tripper]] included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so naïve that you [[could]] cry out of [[shame]] for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their [[bottles]] of [[edulcorated]] fruit juice.

"The [[first]] time I saw ""[[Alice]] in Wonderland  an X-rated Musical Comedy"", was in the early '[[80]] in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. [[City]] with some friends.

Obviously it was the soft-core edited (chopped) [[version]], which left me with the [[desire]] to [[watch]] it again soon, but in its original [[integral]] [[version]]. [[Well]], more then 20 years went by, during which I forgot all about this [[movie]] and, only a few days ago, by sheer chance, I stumbled upon a heavily used [[VHS]] copy (which had [[seen]] better times: a [[bit]] washed-out colors, scratchy sound and a few [[flaws]]), but [[guess]] what? [[It's]] the [[original]] uncut [[version]] and, this [[time]], I [[really]] had a [[ball]]! [[Humor]], Musical and Porn [[may]] [[sound]] an [[awkward]] combination but, in this [[case]], it [[really]] [[works]] and, unlikely the big majority of boring [[porn-flicks]] nowadays invading our screens, this is a [[really]] amusing and entertaining sex [[fantasy]], which will not [[disappoint]] you. [[The]] [[direction]] is [[clever]], the swift editing [[makes]] the movie [[fly]] [[like]] a [[bird]], all the familiar characters are lovable or just [[plain]] [[funny]], all the actors seem having a [[good]] [[time]], the songs are catchy ([[worth]] [[mentioning]] the one about ""growing up"" [[sung]] by Alice at the beginning of the [[movie]] and the [[hilarious]] ""[[What's]] a nice girl [[like]] you doing on a Knight [[like]] this""), the dance [[numbers]] are [[well]] choreographed and [[staged]] (amazingly [[energetic]] Terry Hall [[proves]] that she can ""also"" dance and [[dances]] [[enthusiastically]] her guts away...Don't [[worry]], she [[also]] does what she was [[best]] known for...), the acting, the singing, the set, the costumes are of quality level and then...there is Kristine ""Blue Eyes"" [[DeBell]], in the first starring role of her career and (oh boy!) she indeed has a few H.C. [[sequences]]! Personally I [[think]] they are [[absolutely]] not distasteful, on the [[contrary]], they are [[spontaneous]] and quite [[arousing]]. [[She]] is young and (ohhh!) so very pretty; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality so, she sings, she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy.

"[[Even]] for the [[non-opera]] loving public the [[name]] CARMEN is [[immediately]] [[recognized]] as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy [[girl]] whose capricious loves [[destroy]] men. [[But]] as [[much]] as the [[opera]] is now [[considered]] a [[staple]] in [[every]] opera house [[repertoire]], the real story of the [[wild]] gypsy lass as created by [[Prosper]] Mérimée in 1845 has [[never]] been [[told]] as [[well]] as in this [[cinematic]] [[version]] by the abundantly [[gifted]] [[Spanish]] [[director]] Vicente [[Aranda]] ('Juana [[la]] [[Loca]] AKA [[Mad]] [[Love']],'Amantes', '[[If]] they tell you I [[fell']], etc.). [[Incorporating]] the author of the novel as a main character seeking the [[story]] of Carmen from one of her lovers - [[José]] - [[provides]] just the [[right]] [[vantage]] for the story of this famous gypsy wild [[lady]] to be told. <br /><br />Carmen (the [[amazingly]] [[beautiful]] and [[talented]] Paz Vega) works in a [[cigar]] factory in [[Seville]], a [[factory]] adjoining the [[military]] station where the very [[proper]] José ([[Leonardo]] Sbaraglia) is stationed. [[Carmen]] is tempestuous and in a [[fight]] instigated by a [[fellow]] [[factory]] worker [[bringing]] attention to the [[fact]] that Carmen is a gypsy, [[Carmen]] [[murders]] the [[co-worker]] and is arrested. [[José]] is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen [[flirts]] with him he consents to allow her to escape - his [[payback]] is the promise for a night of passion with Carmen.

"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF [[YOU]] DON'T WANT [[THE]] MOVIE SPOILED!!*<br /><br />I was originally [[planning]] on seeing this [[movie]] this past weekend, but my plans [[ended]] up making me unable to have [[time]] to [[see]] it. So me & my [[friend]] made plans to see it after school [[today]]. Boy, are we [[glad]] we did. [[The]] movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of [[guys]] (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], [[Steve]] Frezelli [[[Edward]] [[Norton]]], [[Lyle]], [[also]] [[known]] as ""Napster"" [Seth [[Green]], you'll get the [[nickname]] later], [[Handsome]] Rob [Jason Statham], [[Left]] Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal [[32]] gold bricks. [[This]] leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and [[involves]] a boat chase, which [[opens]] the [[movie]] up [[right]]. [[While]] driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, [[steals]] the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) [[leader]] of the group. Fast foward to a [[year]] [[later]], where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can [[ask]] for. [[Charlie]] Croker (who was [[actually]] indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of [[retirement]] for the heist) [[says]] that they've found Steve (who has gone into [[hiding]]), and want to get [[back]] at him for what he did. [[She]] at [[first]] declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back [[together]], along with [[getting]] the [[help]] of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to [[carry]] out the [[perfect]] heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. [[This]] movie is a [[perfect]] mix of [[action]] with [[funny]] bits thrown in [[throughout]]. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how [[Shawn]] Fanning (who makes a cameo) [[stole]] it while he fell asleep, and eventually [[Lyle]] will only answer if [[refered]] to as ""Napster"". [[There's]] [[even]] a [[funny]] line in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it [[described]] his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

Right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it. [[Wlel]], if you get the privilege to watch this [[movіe]], after watching it remember that Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman is a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can't fill up ten lines heres some great scenes: <br /><br />**SPOILERS** <br /><br />The three women on the beach had great deaths. The first one had Jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them. He kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs.<br /><br />The other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole. One of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying ""COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!"".

"Eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, [[Nevsky]] can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. By the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. Nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a milestone in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. [[Another]] strong point is [[Prokofiev's]] [[beautiful]], haunting soundtrack (using a [[composer]] to score a movie was completely unusual at the time).

"CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the Sydney Opera House'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.","CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia.

"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a [[painful]] experience. <br /><br />I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty [[disappointing]], especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera [[shots]] of her leap actually ruin it's [[effect]] because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she [[would]] NEVER [[get]] into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually [[say]] at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her [[appalling]] costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined.

[[After]] some altercation during his [[time]] in jail, Kersey [[learned]] that [[Franker]], who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the New York City in the hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time, everywhere and everyday.

Charles Bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the ""big old cat"", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy [[also]] did his job very good. His main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character.

She could have more role to appear.<br /><br />For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie [[great]] for extreme action film fans. Fast-paced with back and Forth style made this movie very interested to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money. Haha! that's like a joke! Although, I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey.<br /><br />In another case, the ending scene of the movie set back me. It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him. I thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Film's movie, but I dislike it.<br /><br />For the summary, I am OK with Death Wish 3 due to my explanation I typed first.

I loved the action [[figures]], but I found the [[cartoon]] to be corny and I hated the [[storyline]] (the He-Man I liked was the one from the very early, pre-cartoon mini-comics included in the figure boxes, where He-Man was a Barbarian, the Sword of Power was split in two pieces, and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam-ripoff premise, and no Orko). Anyway, let's leave the old stuff alone.<br /><br />The [[new]] He-Man cartoon (or at least this [[pilot]]) is a [[disgrace]] on its own, s it represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show, and the worst tendences of nowadays. I [[watched]] it because I had [[heard]] the in-your-face morals of the old show were (thankfully) gone, and this one had more swordplay and character development. But I encountered an [[awful]] mishmash of the worst clichés of the genre, characters I couldn't help but hate, and the sadly inevitable Matrix-esque visual style.<br /><br />I think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters, as it was [[showing]] a pre-face-peeling Skeletor, but that's how far the character development goes, aside from the usual coming-to-age [[rubbish]] I see coming in the subsequent episodes, where this teenybopper Adam will be learning the responsibility of his new-acquired powers, blah blah. [[At]] [[least]] in the old show Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself [[hating]] his guts. That's what we get when they put out an [[adventure]] [[show]] aimed at pre-teens: pretty faces and wanna-be-cool-and-look-juvenile clothes. I should check new episodes to see if N'Sync make a special appearance. Man, does this show remind me to the 1996 Flash Gordon stinkbomb cartoon!<[[br]] /><br />Dialogue? Ha! It [[follows]] absolutely [[every]] [[cliché]] in the book, from the goody-lil-two-shoes Randor in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal ""Oh, and He-Man... I lied!"" in the ending. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high-pitch kind than in the old series. 20 years, and nothing we have learnt.<br /><br />And sure, nowadays there can't exist something remotely action-related that's not Matrix-style. Leave Anime to the Japanese, folks, think fresh ideas. And seeing the characters' poses while fighting didn't help either.<br /><br />Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell comes up with these names?) has no yellow skin now, but grey-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu won't appear in the show either. Shades of the 1996 FG again, where Ming the Merciless was a green, toad-like alien!<br /><br />People are complaining about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I would have liked this more or less if Cringer spoke, he's corny enough this way. And you have your extra ration of cheese with Orko!

"Christian Duguay directed this tidy [[little]] espionage thriller early in his career. It plays on TV pretty regularly, albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately trimmed. I finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a $3 tape from the local video store. Naval officer Aidan Quinn is recruited to impersonate the notorious Carlos the Jackal, and gets a little too caught up in the role. Donald Sutherland Ben Kingsley play Quinn's superiors, with Sutherland a true zealot and Kingsley as the more level-headed one. The first half of this [[fun]] flick shows Quinn being trained and indoctrinated. The second half has him out in the field, making love to the Jackal's woman and shooting it out with sundry enemies. The idea is to make the Jackal look like a turncoat to the Russians, and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin. Things don't exactly play out as planned. At times, I almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue, but they all play it very straight. In the end, this is [[one]] [[terrific]] little thriller that [[deserves]] your attention. The Jackal's former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married Quinn to rough her up, lick blood from her face, and then go down on her, alone is [[worth]] the price of admission.","Christian Duguay directed this tidy [[littⅼe]] espionage thriller early in his career.

"I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max. After having viewed Lifeforce for fifteen years on tape, I have to say that the 'uncut' DVD version was both [[great]] and disappointing. The U.S. version is so *much* [[better]] than the DVD (European?) version. The U.S. version of lifeforce moves much faster (the editing on the DVD version is terrible. Feels like an unfinished cut). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact one ""new"" moment almost destroys the entire movie, when Caine (peter firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. I love this scene, in the U.S. version though. On the DVD, the male alien speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo [[hilarious]]. It's the pinnacle of hilarity:<br /><br />""It'll be much less terrifying if you just come to me!"" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. I was floored when I saw this. It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious flick. I'm glad Hooper (or whoever) cut that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes that were made for the U.S. version that make Lifeforce that much [[better]] and I wished the DVD had the U.S. version. The editing is [[sharp]] and frenzied [[without]] being annoying and some spots that were already boring in the U.S. version are even more boring on the DVD version because of added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD is terrible. Much better in the U.S. version. More subtle.<br /><br />I [[love]] this film. It's basically aliens making a pit-stop over earth and sucking up as much Lifeforce as possible. The film has too many flat, uninspiring sequences (talk, talk, talk) but when the action goes to London, it's fun. The film really shines in these scenes. One can see Hooper finally doing what he's great at: chaos, savagery, horror! Lifeforce should have had more of these chaos scenes. They're the best Apocalyptic scenes ever put on film. It's also the best zombie movie ever. The zombies are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. Not the slow moving bores of other zombie movies. Also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />And to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />As for the DVD, well, it ain't great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope that they'll release a clean, crisp U.S. version on a DVD, and with commentary by Hooper and Dykstra.","I finally got hold of Lifeforce on DVD with the widescreen format intact and rousing Henry Mancini score to the max.

[[She's]] repressed everything that would free her from her [[self-imposed]] bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no [[longer]] even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving [[impulse]] would feel like.<br /><br />This is a [[graphic]] [[portrait]] of a [[severe]] emotional [[cripple]], one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - [[we're]] all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so [[many]] conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also [[deals]] [[brilliantly]] with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. [[Huppert's]] character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the [[emancipating]] experience she had imagined it to be. <br /><[[br]] />Regarding the [[much-discussed]] scene in the bathroom: I really [[appreciated]] how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she's acting out her [[let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy]] scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor [[unsuspecting]] dupe.<br /><br />I think [[another]] incredible [[achievement]] of this movie is how, about halfway through it, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading sub-titles. That has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. <br /><br />In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead.

"The cast alone tells you this will be a notch above the usual Italian western. Veteran actors Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy team up with Alex Cord who, at the time, seemed on the verge of stardom. The result is a [[movie]] [[that's]] both [[off-beat]] and down-beat and yet [[it'll]] satisfy those who seek more from a western than just gunplay. [[Especially]] [[interesting]] here is the [[character]] played by Alex Cord. One expects the ""hero"" in these westerns to be taciturn and introspective, but ""Clay McCord"" is an extreme example and, surprisingly enough, he's often shone in a passive, even weak position. Much is made of the fact that he fears falling prey to the epileptic fits which immobilized his father, and in these moments of helplessness he's either at the mercy of those who wish to harm him or those who wish to help him. To emphasize his passivity, Clay McCord -- don't you [[love]] that name? -- is often shone stripped to the waist as if he were little more than an attractive plaything being put on display. There's even a strong masochistic streak in his nature, most in evidence when he's used as a punching bag by his enemies and then suspended by his wrists and left hanging above the middle of a street. Not only does he often fail to protect himself, but McCord is equally ineffective in protecting those around him. Nearly everyone who helps him is killed. <br /><br />While ""A Minute to Pray, a Second to Die"" is [[far]] from being a complete [[success]], it has a depth and a tone which sets it apart and causes it to linger in the memory. It's also a [[good]] [[showcase]] for Alex Cord whose career tended to decline after this point following a few promising years in the mid-1960s.

"Dr. Chopper starts shortly after teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at Lake Tatonka the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about. So Nicholas together with his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) & three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) & Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) head out there for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed & their neighbours turn out to be Dr. Chopper (Ed Brigadier) & his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments...<br /><br />Going [[straight-to-video]]/DVD Dr. Chopper was edited & directed by Lewis Schoenburn & this film seems to be having a hard time here on the IMDb with some pretty harsh reviews, while I think Dr. Chopper as a horror film is pretty [[worthless]] I don't think some of the criticism I've read is entirely justified. The script which takes itself very seriously is credited to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as Detective [[Crocker]] according to the IMDb cast list although I can't remember any character of that name, maybe he was one of the cops at the start? Anyway, the basic story is alright I suppose although it's a tad [[dull]] & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some [[sort]] of evil character running around bumping off our [[annoying]] American teen [[cast]], you know the drill by now. [[Besides]] some brief & [[undeveloped]] [[nonsense]] about Dr. Chopper [[using]] body [[parts]] to [[replenish]] his own deteriorating body there's not much story here & the script seems to [[exist]] solely to [[invent]] situations for girls to take their tops off, there's the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. Oh, & when I say topless I mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in Dr. Chopper at all. So there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clichéd dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. To be honest I expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe I'm just being picky.<br /><br />Director Schoenburn does OK actually, this is by no means the worst looking film I've seen although it still looks cheap. There's no style here, I didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. The gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.<br /><br />Technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. The acting is alright, it could have better but I've certainly seen worse.<br /><br />Dr. Chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.","Dr. Chopper starts shortly after teenager Nicholas' (Robert Adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at Lake Tatonka the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about.

"Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie.

The special effects are [[embarrassing]] even for a made for TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so [[low]] budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms.

"[[The]] [[Golden]] [[Door]] is the story of a [[Sicilian]] [[family's]] journey from the [[Old]] [[World]] ([[Italy]]) to the [[New]] [[World]] ([[America]]). [[Salvatore]], a [[middle-aged]] man who [[hopes]] for a more fruitful [[life]], persuades his family to [[leave]] their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land [[whose]] rivers supposedly flow with milk. In [[short]], they believe that by risking everything for the [[New]] World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. [[The]] imagery of the New [[World]] is [[optimistic]], clever and highly [[imaginative]]. [[Silver]] [[coins]] rain from [[heaven]] upon Salvatore as he [[anticipates]] how prosperous [[he'll]] be in the [[New]] [[World]]; carrots and [[onions]] [[twice]] the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and [[health]], and [[rivers]] of milk are swam in and [[flow]] through the minds of those who anticipate what the [[New]] [[World]] will [[yield]]. [[All]] of this [[imagery]] is [[surrealistically]] [[interwoven]] with the characters and helps [[nicely]] [[compliment]] the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. [[The]] contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the [[Sicilian]] [[people]] helps provide hope while [[they're]] aboard the ship to the [[New]] [[World]].<br /><br />The [[voyage]] to the [[New]] World is [[shot]] almost in [[complete]] darkness, especially when the seas [[tempests]] roar and nearly kill the people within. [[The]] dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the [[New]] World. [[The]] Old World is depicted as somewhat [[destitute]] and primitive. [[This]] is shown as Salvatore scrambles [[together]] to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, [[goats]] and rabbits) in [[order]] to obtain the appropriate [[clothing]] he [[needs]] to enter the New [[World]]. I thought it was [[rather]] interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a [[certain]] dress [[code]] in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a [[particular]] stereotype or mold in order to be [[recognized]] as [[morally]] fit. The most [[powerful]] image in the film was when the ship is [[leaving]] their homeland and setting sail for the New [[World]]. [[This]] shot [[shows]] an overhead view of a [[crowd]] of people who slowly seem to separate from [[one]] another, [[depicting]] the separation between the Old and New Worlds. [[This]] shot also suggested that the [[people]] were being torn away from all that was once [[familiar]], wanted to divorce from their [[previous]] dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that [[held]] more promise.<[[br]] /><br />As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright [[yet]] foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional [[directing]] choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him.

"[[The]] [[title]] tells it all -- Ed [[Gein]], the butcher of [[Plainfield]].<[[br]] /><br />It's not a zappy action-filled [[slasher]] movie made for [[teens]] high on [[energy]] [[drinks]].

And they're sufficiently [[revolting]] that I couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this Grand Guignol opening.<br /><br />[[Alas]], it's not. The acting is uniformly [[terrible]], as in a high [[school]] play. The script does its best to [[sink]] below vulgarity. Ed Gein, who killed only two middle-aged women and maybe his brother, chases a screaming, bloody young woman through the Woodland of Weir, and she's wearing only a modern bra and bikini, rather than [[period]] underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense.<br /><br />The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, law officers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered all over the windshield. There is no body. The handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim, who may still be in the vicinity and living. The sheriff, lacking any motivation, shouts at him, ""Now you just FORGET that! I don't want you going off HALF COCKED on anything!"" It should be no more than a business-like exchange of views. Why does the director have the sheriff so angry? Characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs -- Louis Armstrong's ""Ain't Misbehaving,"" for instance. This is -- what -- rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio would be playing Kitty Kallen's ""Wheel of Fortune"" or Theresa Brewer or, equally likely, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs, that's all.<br /><br />Of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget, but it can be light years ahead of this butchery. See ""Ed Gein,"" with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies, and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much.<br /><br />These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. That's about as far as I could get. If anyone finds this tale to be well-executed and fascinating in any way, he should try to find some insight into his tastes.

Characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old jazzy pop songs -- Louis Armstrong's ""Ain't Misbehaving,"" for instance. This is -- what -- rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nope. The radio would be playing Kitty Kallen's ""Wheel of Fortune"" or Theresa Brewer or, equally likely, Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs, that's all.<br /><br />Of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget, but it can be light years ahead of this butchery. See ""Ed Gein,"" with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his penchant for dead bodies, and on a budget that couldn't have exceeded this one by much.<br /><br />These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. That's about as far as I could get. If anyone finds this tale to be well-executed and fascinating in any way, he should try to find some insight into his tastes. It's beneath mine -- and I consider myself pretty warped.",0.028285622596740723,0.5254746675491333,0,1,0,703,"Successful"

"""The Falcon and the Snowman"" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union.

"[[It's]] pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that [[time]]. The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its [[mostly]] lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! <br /><br />[[Juano]] Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South. The crowd could really care less about the details--they are just hell-bent on a hanging. And, despite his commitment to the law, the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the [[truth--just]] delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a LEGAL hanging!

The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its [[mostlу]] lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job! <br /><br />[[Juanо]] Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South. The crowd could really care less about the details--they are just hell-bent on a hanging. And, despite his commitment to the law, the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the [[truth-˗just]] delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a LEGAL hanging!

The leading actors in these ""Jewish"" films were always played by non-Jews. For example Larry Parks a non-Jew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar.

There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the [[film]] as [[Hanks]] plays well, Tom Hanks.<[[br]] /><br />The book itself is [[rich]] with arguably accurate content as [[always]], and had a [[lot]] more plot points on science [[versus]] religion, and a [[wealth]] of information that Dan Brown researched and [[linked]] together in an [[engaging]] fictional [[piece]] of work. While [[reading]] the [[book]] some [[years]] ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.<br /><br />Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.<br /><br />Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid.

There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the [[filｍ]] as [[Hankѕ]] plays well, Tom Hanks.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />The book itself is [[riϲh]] with arguably accurate content as [[alwayѕ]], and had a [[lo𝚝]] more plot points on science [[versuѕ]] religion, and a [[weal𝚝h]] of information that Dan Brown researched and [[link]] [[ed]] together in an [[eng]] [[aging]] fictional [[peice]] of work. While [[readіng]] the [[boo𝒌]] some [[yearѕ]] ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.<br /><br />Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.<br /><br />Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular.",0.04146265983581543,0.5167691111564636,1,0,1,1707,"Successful"

"Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a [[wonderful]] character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income, because neither of them work. Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. This leads to the bitter, grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling, getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy, despite her fortunes. She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much, usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or, at the very most, toss complaints back and forth to each other.<br /><br />""Late Chrysanthemums"" is very slow-moving and not much actually [[happens]] but Naruse, like all great directors, has the [[ability]] to do much with very little.

"A [[recent]] [[re-issue]] of the [[French]] crime [[film]] ([[original]] title 'Du [[Rififi]] Chez les [[Hommes']]), with its [[famous]] [[20-minute]] silent jewel heist sequence, now [[comes]] in the US in a [[gorgeous]] [[new]] print from [[The]] Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some [[extras]]. [[Jules]] Dassin was an [[American]] (born [[Julius]] Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was [[forced]] to make films in [[Europe]] because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was [[well]] publicized in the US and did [[well]] in art houses. [[Later]] Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for '[[Never]] on Sunday' ([[1960]]) [[starring]] his [[wife]], the [[Greek]] actress and political [[activist]] [[Melina]] Mercouri. ([[Greece]] was again glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis [[Kakogiannis']] 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi [[DVD]] includes a [[recent]] interview with Dassin. I did not [[previously]] realize that one of the [[main]] robbers, Cesar the [[Milanese]], was played by [[Dassin]], who stepped in when the original [[actor]] became unavailable. He's one of the most [[memorable]] [[characters]], a dandified [[Italian]] safe cracker who [[speaks]] no French.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Although this [[classic]] has all the trappings of French film [[noir--the]] black and white twilight world of well lit apartments, shiny [[black]] cars, men in suits, the nightclub [[scenes]], including a [[dramatically]] filmed and [[lit]] title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in hand or mouth--I don't [[think]] it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as [[Melville's]] films do. [[But]] there's the [[mesmerizing]] robbery, which [[still]] holds up [[today]] as a tour de force. It goes like clockwork, with a [[fine]] sense of craft and [[teamwork]] among the robbers. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. Things [[quickly]] go wrong after they go home and distribute the loot when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a [[million-dollar]] bangle in it. [[Has]] there ever been a heist film [[whose]] perps lived happily ever after? <[[br]] /><[[br]] />It's the [[wordless]] [[heist]] sequence that guarantees this a [[special]] place, and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and [[exotic]] [[career]], [[deserves]] [[full]] credit for that. He took a novel so conventional he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'.

"The 1973 [[musical]] version of LOST HORIZON is the most [[wonderful]] [[endearing]] and campy [[musical]] films of [[ALL]] TIME. The 1973 musical remake of the [[James]] Hilton [[novel]] about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special [[gem]]. [[Music]] by BURT BACHARACH and [[lyrics]] by HAL [[David]]. A strange mixture of [[straight]] [[drama]], [[adventure]] and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the ONLY anti [[war]] [[musical]] [[fantasy]] [[ever]] [[filmed]]. <br /><br />This film was a [[critical]] and [[financial]] disappointment in the [[United]] States, but made a lot of money overseas. [[Only]] in [[America]] did it fail. [[Highly]] different and [[unique]] in it's approach as a film [[musical]], it [[deserves]] far better credit than it's given. [[As]] a story, [[LOST]] HORIZON is an [[incredible]] adventure and both the 1937 Frank [[Capra]] film and this [[1973]] [[musical]] are faithful adaptations of the [[James]] Hilton [[novel]]. [[What]] I [[like]] about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The [[film]] has a [[prestigious]] [[cast]] and a [[gifted]] director and [[cinematographer]]. [[This]] is a [[BURT]] BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a [[wonderful]] [[place]]. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE [[THE]] JOY and LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER [[evoke]] a [[happiness]] that [[Hilton]] [[wrote]] about in his [[novel]]. Why shouldn't [[Shangri-La]] be a slightly goofy [[place]]? The two love songs, I MIGHT [[FRIGHTEN]] HER AWAY and the [[deleted]] I COME TO YOU are the sensitive spots in the picture. There's a peacefulness and [[soft]] [[spoken]] quality in both these songs that is very [[much]] keeping with the philosophy of the story. [[Moreover]], THE THINGS I [[WILL]] NOT MISS is a [[good]] [[duet]] with a [[strong]] [[melody]]. It's a nice [[exchange]] of [[different]] [[types]] of [[perspective]] and who can [[fault]] with [[Olivia]] Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping, [[singing]] and dancing on tables? They're a [[wonderful]] [[team]] and the [[number]] is [[well]] staged. <[[br]] /><br />I [[always]] [[found]] it [[interesting]] in this story how the High Lama [[kidnaps]] someone from the [[outside]] [[world]] to [[take]] his place in [[Shangri-La]]. The [[character]] of the High [[Lama]] is a [[gentle]] [[soul]] but somewhat [[radical]] in his view of [[mankind]] as a whole. He has no hope for the [[world]] [[outside]] of [[Shangri-La]]. If this [[film]] were to be [[remade]] today, it [[would]] be interesting to [[see]] more emphasis put on the [[leading]] character, [[RICHARD]] [[ONWAY'S]] conflict with what he [[left]] behind in the [[outside]] world as opposed to what he's found in Shangri-La.<br /><br />[[Of]] course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as [[suffering]] amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /><br />LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost [[unreasonable]]. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves [[rediscovering]]. A lost and [[legendary]] treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.","The 1973 [[musicaⅼ]] version of LOST HORIZON is the most [[wnoderful]] [[endaring]] and campy [[musicaⅼ]] films of [[AL]] TIME.

"This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu.

Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance.

Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's ""pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo,"" and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, ""Long Hot Summer,"" and while not a huge fan of the show, enjoyed ""Murder, She Wrote."" But [[HEE]] -- I not only didn't care for the story or other aspects, but I found Angela's squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the MOST [[ANNOIYNG]] presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like an [[սnending]] [[continuatiоn]] of Audrey Hepburn's equally ""over-the top"" Cockney [[chortli]] [[ng]] at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of ""My Fair Lady."" But that was incident to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) [[bri]] [[ef]]. Unmercifully, this was anything but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of ""relativity"" at work.) If I hadn't been with friends, with the necessity to remain, MY viewing would have been brief. I laughed, though, at the ""[[Senifeld]]"" episode where [[Eⅼaine]] pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked ""The English Patient."" My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie.

"The 80's is largely considered the decade in which horror decided to have fun.

"Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage.

"[[It's]] [[rare]] that I [[get]] the opportunity to review a film for IMDb that relates to my own life in such a [[close]] [[way]]. However, as someone living with cerebral palsy (albeit less severe than [[Michael]], one of the main characters in the film) I don't wish to give this film a 'free pass' just because it tackles a subject that's rarely approached; and when it is, is normally treated with po-faced seriousness. There WERE minor problems I had with the film; and I'd like to address those first, so that people are clear that it isn't my situation which has clouded my judgement of this overall [[excellent]] [[film]]! <br /><br />* Parts of it I felt were unashamedly crowd-pleasing, at the expense of realism.

Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to the next. Seemingly simple and docile, suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. Ms. Lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along. She could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. You could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor. I don't know what war her husband was killed in, but if it was World War II, the furnishings in her house, the styles of the clothes, especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic.

"After a couple years of searching for the Humphrey Bogart film, ""Two Against the World"", it unexpectedly showed up as a TCM offering under the title ""One Fatal Hour"", a First National film from 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott, the man who runs WUBC, a radio station whose program lineup is losing listeners. The owner Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic executive who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by pawning them off on Scott.<br /><br />In an effort to boost the audience base and revenues, Reynolds has the idea of reviving a twenty year old murder case, and offering it as a fifteen chapter radio play.

However Gloria Pembroke has married, and is now living as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to be married (on the same day no less as the radio play is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). About to be faced with the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs embark on a crusade to have the program stopped.

"[[Cinema's]] [[greatest]] [[period]] [[started]] in [[post-War]] [[Europe]] with [[Italy's]] Neo-Realist movement. During the [[next]] [[2]] or 3 [[decades]] that followed, [[France's]] [[New]] Wavers [[caught]] [[everyone's]] attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate [[Scandinavian]] island somewhere, making [[bitter]] masterpieces. But in [[1971]], Luchino Visconti [[brought]] the art-form to [[full]] [[circle]], geographically [[speaking]], with his [[miraculous]] work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *[[The]] Death of Europoean Cinema*. [[After]] the Sixties [[wound]] down, so did the great European [[filmmakers]], who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a [[new]] American generation of Movie Brats ([[Coppola]], Scorsese, & Co.). [[This]] movie [[absolutely]] feels like a [[grand]] summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular [[obsessions]], but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in [[movies]]. [[And]] rest assured, you will find no [[sterner]] task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left [[behind]]. The pacing is a [[challenge]]: slow, but [[never]] without emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a [[sturm-und-drang]] cosmos.<[[br]] /><br />We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the [[movies]]: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the [[lead]] role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling [[almost]] ceaselessly in the background, Gustav [[Mahler's]] 5th [[Symphony]]. [[Taking]] [[full]] [[advantage]] of Mahler's [[ability]] to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the [[main]] [[character]], Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even [[making]] Bogarde up to LOOK [[like]] [[Mahler]] ([[geeky]] [[mustache]], specs, shaggy hair, [[duck-like]] [[walk]]). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably [[greatest]] performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick [[without]] mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />","[[Ciոema's]] [[greates𝚝]] [[perioԁ]] [[starteԁ]] in [[pos𝚝-War]] [[Euⲅope]] with [[Italy`s]] Neo-Realist movement.

But in [[1791]], Luchino Visconti [[brough𝚝]] the art-form to [[fulⅼ]] [[circⅼe]], geographically [[spea𝒌ing]], with his [[miraculouѕ]] work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *[[Te]] Death of Europoean Cinema*. [[Afteⲅ]] the Sixties [[wounԁ]] down, so did the great European [[filmmakerѕ]], who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a [[nw]] American generation of Movie Brats ([[Co]] [[ppola]], Scorsese, & Co.). [[Tis]] movie [[absoluteⅼy]] feels like a [[granԁ]] summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular [[ob]] [[sessions]], but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in [[moves]]. [[Anԁ]] rest assured, you will find no [[sterneⲅ]] task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left [[behid]]. The pacing is a [[chalⅼenge]]: slow, but [[neveⲅ]] without emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a [[sturm-unԁ-drang]] cosmos.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the [[movieѕ]]: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the [[laed]] role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling [[almos𝚝]] ceaselessly in the background, Gustav [[Mahler'ѕ]] 5th [[Syｍphony]]. [[Ta𝒌ing]] [[fulⅼ]] [[advan𝚝age]] of Mahler's [[abiⅼity]] to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the [[maiո]] [[characteⲅ]], Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even [[ma𝒌ing]] Bogarde up to LOOK [[li𝒌e]] [[Mahleⲅ]] ([[geekу]] [[mustaϲhe]], specs, shaggy hair, [[duck-ike]] [[wal𝒌]]). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably [[greates𝚝]] performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick [[withou𝚝]] mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />",0.03769111633300781,0.5087007284164429,1,0,1,2532,"Successful"

"I am [[really]] surprised that this [[film]] only has a rating of [[6]].[[4]] as of the [[time]] I did this [[review]]. [[While]] not [[exactly]] a [[great]] film, I do [[think]] it's one of the [[best]] [[films]] Dietrich did and it's a shame it isn't more [[highly]] [[regarded]]. I [[think]] a [[lot]] of the [[reason]] I [[liked]] the [[film]] so [[much]] is that the [[usual]] [[silly]] Dietrich persona as the ""[[über-vamp]]"" isn't [[present]] and her role required her to actually act. I just [[hate]] [[seeing]] film after film after film in the early days of her career where she [[seemed]] more like a caricature or cliché than a real woman. I don't necessarily blame Dietrich for the silly [[vampish]] films she made in the 1930s--audiences loved them and they did make her famous. But here, she showed she [[really]] [[could]] act. After all, just looking at her in [[films]] [[like]] MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have guessed that she was well-cast to play a Gypsy! I was quite prepared to hate the film because of this casting decision, but it worked--she was [[pretty]] believable and a lot of fun to watch as [[well]]! The film is, essentially, a vehicle just for [[Ray]] Milland and Marlene [[Dietrich--the]] other supporting characters are very much secondary to the movie. Milland is a wanted spy in pre-WWII Germany and in his efforts to escape, he stumbles upon a rather [[frisky]] [[lone]] Gypsy (Dietrich) who instantly takes him to be a fulfillment of [[prophecy--in]] other words, her new lover! Milland is quite [[stuffy]] but reluctantly agrees to travel in her wagon--even putting on body paint and piercing his ears to make him look [[like]] a Gypsy (hence the title to the movie).

"In the aftermath of September 11th in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. Of course, in the present day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The blazes of the film are ultimately all I could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them, the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking.

"I give ""Flashdance"" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's [[nothing]] more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film.

Not a line of work most older women find their way into, much less 18-year-olds fresh out of high school.

Yet looking at the well choreographed and [[well]] [[polished]] [[dance]] [[routines]] the girls do [[every]] [[night]] at Mawby's, you would [[think]] they were working at the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip.<br /><br />Alex ends up having a [[predictable]] romance with her boss, Nick Hurley (Michael [[Nouri]]), who is about twice her age. After resisting Nick's advances, because going out with the boss isn't a good idea, she wastes no time in going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship on the job, which makes no [[sense]] given how it is likely to look to Alex's co-workers.<br /><br />[[When]] Beals isn't being doubled for the many dance sequences in the movie, her [[character]] spends most her [[time]] throwing temper tantrums. [[Alex's]] dream is to get an invitation only audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss/boyfriend helps her get the audition she's been dreaming of, she's throws one her tantrums. She angrily tells Nick she isn't doing the audition because of his intervention, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just one scene that leaves you wondering what the hell the makers were thinking when they were making this.<br /><br />Of course, Alex does eventually get her audition at the Conservatory. She puts on a dance routine before the Conservatory board that is so [[ridiculous]] that you would think it was in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. Oh yeah, it is a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation.<br /><br />I don't think I can judge whether or not Beals can actually act well on the basis of what I saw in ""Flashdance"".

By the time a sinister Vladimir Putin lookalike Priest (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off, which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol, and him shouting ""You bastaaaard!"" at his friend's murdered corpse, and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs. [[Onlу]] the climactic boat chase impresses. It's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no [[plɑce]] in this movie. Such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with that sequence!

"[[It's]] now [[2005]] and [[15]]+ years [[since]] this [[cartoon]] first aired. I haven't [[actually]] watched it [[seriously]] or [[closely]] in about 10 years. [[Now]] that [[I'm]] an [[adult]] in my [[30s]] I can [[look]] back with a serious eye as I watch the episodes again.<br /><br />In concept, the cartoon is partly an homage to the [[classic]] [[Looney]] Tunes but also its own [[original]] show. There are a few episodes that are structured like the old [[cartoons]]. [[For]] example, there is a singer that attacks Buster and so he [[exacts]] revenge on this [[singer's]] concert -[[exactly]] like the [[old]] [[Bugs]] [[Bunny]] cartoon. [[The]] ensuing cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, just in a [[different]] [[era]]. If you look at the [[old]] [[Looney]] Tunes, they did an awful lot of stuff [[exactly]] like Tiny Toons did. [[The]] old Looney [[Tunes]] made a lot of [[social]] commentary and [[parody]]. There were [[celebrity]] impersonations. There were a lot of corny [[period]] [[jokes]], slang, and [[dialog]]. [[The]] comedy was surreal and [[wacky]]. You can say this exactly for [[Tiny]] Toons as [[well]]. [[The]] comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most definitely a throwback to the classics which hadn't been [[done]] well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades prior to this [[show]]. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes when something we don't like comes up. But the reason we don't [[think]] Looney Tunes are corny is because we weren't alive back in the 40s. Also, Looney Tunes was [[original]] back in those days but [[today]] cartoons are rehashed over and over. So it's easy to perceive Tiny Toons in an [[unfair]] light due to our exposure to [[current]] events and our overexposure to cartoons in [[general]].<[[br]] /><br />[[There]] certainly are differences in [[many]] respects - the timing, the delivery, and obviously the duration of the shows. They are [[two]] different styles from two different periods, being done under two very [[different]] [[circumstances]] - Looney Tunes being [[made]] for adults in theaters and [[Tiny]] [[Toons]] being [[made]] for kids watching TV. Even so, they did a [[good]] job [[making]] an [[original]] [[show]] with [[original]] gags [[AND]] still paying [[homage]] to and [[patterning]] after the comedy stylings of the [[old]] [[Looney]] Tunes.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Since Tiny [[Toons]] had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated [[inspiration]]. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the [[Marx]] Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. [[Now]] I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes.

It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Giles' ""Who are the Gentlemen?"" lecture to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious.

Such [[techniԛue]] [[migh𝚝]] [[wor𝒌]] for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly [[inappropria𝚝e]] for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. A stroll down the sidewalk, a [[brother-to-brotheⲅ]] discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, [[dis𝚝racting]] this viewer from [[eveⲅ]] being able to enter into the drama. [[Mar𝚝in]] [[alѕo]] [[underctus]] his [[narratiѵe]] by packing in [[fr]] too many [[tоpics]]: besides the birth of mob violence, we [[gt]] anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse...did I miss anything? No doubt a better [[cas𝚝]] (and a better-focused [[direc𝚝ion]]) would have [[kit]] these threads together, as Martin [[suely]] [[intеnded]], to demonstrate how one moral [[flaԝ]] leads into and sustains a [[hot]] of others...but good [[inteոtions]] do not necessarily a [[graet]] [[filｍ]] make.

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly [[ill-timed]] given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.","If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd.

"This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as ""The Deer Hunter."") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being ""the perfect wife"" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, ""I'm going to bust that marriage up!"" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.","This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt.

"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.<br /><br />Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series.

You can tell that filming was a true labour of love too; the attention to detail is incredible.

The fans that have been 'with' the League since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the Local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, Simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise!

As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly.

"Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, getting back to the plot. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization. He's sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a [[meaningless]] string of action sequences, most of which aren't [[even]] well choreographed.<br /><br />Oh, how about this, a helicopter crashes through the roof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one point, accidentally freeing all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<br /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.","Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction.

"As the above suggests, I was ultimately [[unimpressed]] with this movie.

Films don't have to be believable, but films like this, with a political edge and social commentary do. <br /><br />Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but once again, films like this shouldn't be making casting decisions purely based on box office draw. This is absolutely the case with Sutherland, who is frankly [[rubbish]] as [[Doyle]].

In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart-like writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles--in fact, she has no family at all.

"This begrudging and [[angry]] film is against not just the war during which it was made, but all war. It doesn't [[care]] what war it is. It might be the most emotionally [[involving]] [[experience]] I have ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no [[sides]] to the [[two]] main characters in this [[impacting]] [[drama]], which doesn't intimate a point in any [[ceremonial]] [[symbolism]] as [[per]] [[Bergman's]] [[usual]], but plainly showcases [[people]] and their [[lives]] and [[exercises]] what [[Bergman]] has already proved he [[understands]] about a [[person's]] reaction to a movie.<br /><br />[[His]] [[top-drawer]] regulars [[Liv]] [[Ullmann]] and Max Von [[Sydow]] play an [[internalizing]] but [[bickering]] [[married]] couple who were once orchestra musicians. Now they live in a weathered farm house on an island. Part of the building frustration we grow to share with these [[two]] [[people]] fertilizes in the detail that nothing in their [[house]] seems to work. They are not [[reclusive]] [[intellectuals]], [[either]]. They are a rather familiar marriage that has more or [[less]] resigned from life and is [[essentially]] apolitical; they only [[get]] wind of distant rumors of a war that has been going on [[forever]]. Ullmann is concerned with the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. [[Her]] husband Von [[Sydow]] shrugs off that the war will pass them by. Their serenity is interrupted by [[screaming]] [[fighter]] planes [[flying]] low over their house, the killing of a parachuting airman, the arrival of [[dubious]] troops, their inquisition, and eventually their capture by what appears to be the [[local]] side, but loyalties have long since [[splintered]]. <br /><br />They are sent back to their home, witness gratuitous destruction and suffer the vindictive consequences of such an [[agonizingly]] [[distrustful]] [[marriage]]. [[This]], one of my [[top]] [[favorite]] [[Bergman]] efforts, is a study of a [[couple]] jarred from their safely [[self-unaware]] lives and violated by a manipulative [[despair]], testing them both to reveal who they really are.

"One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place. An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women. I believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations, separations and misunderstandings, and still being able to bond and rely on each other. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed ""dead"" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family, each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is, killing her husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts, but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends/family members perform.<br /><br />Another idea that I thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural. The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is to say, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the ""unfinished business."" I believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith (predominantly Catholic) as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality. The belief they held in regards to the dead being ""alive"" was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all, it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play. She's treated as if she still is a ghost (i.e. hiding in small crevices (underneath the bed or inside a car trunk)). I believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted.

"POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'<br /><br />work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes. <br /><br />I would, however, disagree with the reviews I've read complaining that the end feels ""tacked on."" I think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the progression of events, I felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. I've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two, and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. However, these flaws appear throughout, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.<br /><br />To his credit Davies is totally unafraid to write big, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric in the lead. For me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true. <br /><br />So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be uplifted or, at least, distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through CNN or the newspapers -- if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.","POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing.

"Documentaries in which sons and [[daughters]] seek to [[understand]] a [[parent]] and, by the process, their own [[lives]] are not that uncommon. Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of [[narcissism]] and, [[perhaps]], an [[unsubtle]] quest for [[publicly-splashed]] revenge for [[countless]] past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a [[brilliant]], [[fair]] and [[engrossing]] [[portrait]] of a [[fascinating]] parent and ""My [[Architect]]: A [[Son's]] Journey"" is that rare [[achievement]].<[[br]] /><br />Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face [[irreparably]] and brutally scarred by an [[accident]]. He and his parents settled in [[Philadelphia]] where the [[talented]] youngster loved art and music. Soon he [[became]] [[enamored]] of buildings and decided only an [[architect's]] career [[would]] answer his [[creative]] abilities.<br /><br />Kahn became an architect but as this [[film]] shows it took a [[long]] time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his [[field]]. One [[architect]] suggests that he was a victim of the ""yellow armband,"" that [[anti-Semitism]] that along with bias against women was long a [[disreputable]] aspect of the American [[profession]] of architecture.<[[br]] /><br />When he did achieve notice, he was seen, clearly accurately, as a [[self-assured]], [[workaholic]] prophet exclaiming [[unyielding]] demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for [[many]] buildings he built but a few. The [[interview]] with an [[aged]] [[gentleman]] who [[fired]] Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the [[city]] is [[hilarious]].<br /><br />Kahn was a born teacher and some of the [[extensive]] archival footage here shows him with students, his voice steady but passionate, their [[gazes]] respectful and [[intense]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Many architects were interviewed by director, writer and project honcho [[Nathaniel]] Kahn, the architect's only [[son]]. Some are [[world]] famous - I. M. Pei, [[Robert]] A.M. [[Stone]], [[Moshe]] [[Safdie]], [[Frank]] Gehry and the [[still]] active [[nonagenarian]], Philip [[Johnson]]. [[Their]] comments paint a [[vivid]] picture of this [[idealistic]] but in the end financially unsuccessful [[designer]] of buildings that blended the castles, [[fortresses]] and [[grand]] buildings of [[past]] [[centuries]] into designs for the [[present]]. [[Kahn's]] buildings are shown, among the most impressive being the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. To me his style has a neo-Romantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction.<br /><br />But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term [[relationships]], one of which produced a daughter, the other the son. Kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive Kahn back to the marital home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy. <br /><br />When Nathaniel was a young boy Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India where he had pitched one of his massive projects, another one that was never built. At that point his Philadelphia firm was at least $500,000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing.<br /><br />Kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the biggest. A teary local architect hails Kahn for having created a building where democracy may (and hopefully will) flourish.<br /><br />Fellow architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in Kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting.

Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of [[narcssism]] and, [[perhapѕ]], an [[սnsubtle]] quest for [[publicⅼy-splashed]] revenge for [[countlesѕ]] past hurts, real and fantasized. What is unusual is a [[brillian𝚝]], [[faiⲅ]] and [[eոgrossing]] [[portrai𝚝]] of a [[fascina𝚝ing]] parent and ""My [[Architec𝚝]]: A [[So's]] Journey"" is that rare [[achieѵement]].<[[bⲅ]] /><br />Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face [[іrreparably]] and brutally scarred by an [[acciden𝚝]]. He and his parents settled in [[Philadeⅼphia]] where the [[talenteԁ]] youngster loved art and music. Soon he [[becaｍe]] [[en]] [[amored]] of buildings and decided only an [[architect`s]] career [[woulԁ]] answer his [[creatiѵe]] abilities.<br /><br />Kahn became an architect but as this [[filｍ]] shows it took a [[log]] time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his [[filed]]. One [[architec𝚝]] suggests that he was a victim of the ""yellow armband,"" that [[an𝚝i-Semitism]] that along with bias against women was long a [[disr]] [[eputable]] aspect of the American [[profesѕion]] of architecture.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />When he did achieve notice, he was seen, clearly accurately, as a [[self-assureԁ]], [[workaholiϲ]] prophet exclaiming [[u]] [[nyielding]] demands that his vision and only his vision be realized. That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for [[ｍany]] buildings he built but a few. The [[intervieԝ]] with an [[ageԁ]] [[gentleｍan]] who [[fried]] Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the [[ci𝚝y]] is [[hilariouѕ]].<br /><br />Kahn was a born teacher and some of the [[extensiѵe]] archival footage here shows him with students, his voice steady but passionate, their [[gazeѕ]] respectful and [[intenѕe]].<[[bⲅ]] /><[[bⲅ]] />Many architects were interviewed by director, writer and project honcho [[Nathanieⅼ]] Kahn, the architect's only [[ѕon]]. Some are [[worlԁ]] famous - I. M. Pei, [[Rober𝚝]] A.M. [[S𝚝one]], [[Moѕhe]] [[S]] [[afdie]], [[Fran𝒌]] Gehry and the [[stilⅼ]] active [[nonɑgenarian]], Philip [[Jоhnson]]. [[Theiⲅ]] comments paint a [[viviԁ]] picture of this [[idealistiϲ]] but in the end financially unsuccessful [[desiner]] of buildings that blended the castles, [[fortressеs]] and [[graոd]] buildings of [[рast]] [[cеnturies]] into designs for the [[presеnt]]. [[Kah]] [[n's]] buildings are shown, among the most impressive being the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. To me his style has a neo-Romantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction.<br /><br />But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long-term [[relat]] [[ionships]], one of which produced a daughter, the other the son. Kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive Kahn back to the marital home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy. <br /><br />When Nathaniel was a young boy Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India where he had pitched one of his massive projects, another one that was never built. At that point his Philadelphia firm was at least $500,000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing.<br /><br />Kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the biggest. A teary local architect hails Kahn for having created a building where democracy may (and hopefully will) flourish.<br /><br />Fellow architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in Kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting. I disagree: it's sadly ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of America's true architectural gems, the old Pennsylvania Station, wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory.<br /><br />There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger Kahn's journey, including with his half-sisters and his mother, but they're genuine and moving, not maudlin and staged.

"I think this movie [[lacks]] so much of [[substance]], it is even not [[worth]] a discussion.<br /><br />In the first, the package is really disgusting.

"I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film. <br /><br />Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroic<br /><br />style.

But just<br /><br />because there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in a<br /><br />city like Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau's<br /><br />Cyrano.

"Andrew Gurland's ""Cheats"" is his fictionalized ""true story"" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests.

The adults include high-strung North Point principal Mary Tyler Moore (as Mrs. Stark) and pornography-loving father Griffin Dunne (as Mr. Davis). The high jinks begin with [[Mr]].

In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come straight out of Mein Kampf rather than Marx. And, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation.

"(Synopsis) In the year [[2055]], the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. Travis and Sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct.<br /><br />(Comment) The [[movie]] was a little slow and the [[concept]] of going back in time and changing things was a little [[overdone]]. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. They changed the skyline of Chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future were [[silly]] looking. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD.

It's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad [[dialogue]] you can imagine.

Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, where the hell is he meant to be from?!? Oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards! The guy who wrote and directed it - a Pee Wee Herman lookalike with a Greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role, maybe this is part of the joke, I don't know. Actually, the more I think about it the more I'm sure this film is a p*ss take. It's produced by Quentin Tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh. It is a total rip off of Tarantino's style, but just done really really badly. It is very amusing though, and I guess either way it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the Tarantino/Rodriguez style, or something that is very very unintentionally funny.

"Okay, here's the deal. There's this American pilot who's flying along, minding his own business, when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil, cowardly non-American fighter planes (they're Middle Eastern types, but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley), who proceed to shoot him down. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong, but those evil non-Americans didn't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death!!<br /><br />Now, what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug, contented look about him. He'll make those Americans pay, oh yes indeed!<br /><br />But He didn't reckon on Doug Masters, the captured pilots 16-year-old son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car, (which can't be that long) and decides to fly into that evil, foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot Chappy' Sinclair, Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. <br /><br />Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail, but you'd be wrong. Sure, those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots, but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably, the evil, not quite so smug anymore, dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself, in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAH!<br /><br />After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90% of their air force, the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down, but in the nick of time, a flight of US F16s turn up and scare them away.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film enough. It was the first ever videocassette movie that I brought, and until I was twenty, I kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that I could rescue him. But he's doesn't like flying, so it didn't happen.","Okay, here's the deal.

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much [[either]], and she'd never [[read]] the book). In this [[movie]] they [[managed]] to sap all the charm from the book and [[turn]] it into [[dull]] mush. A big part of the problem was [[William]] H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second [[glimpse]] at the embassy), where [[Thorpe]] solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps [[set]] up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's [[betrayal]] in the [[end]] is not [[nearly]] as affecting, because they don't [[seem]] all that close. In the book they become pretty good [[friends]] especially on Fred's side, which [[makes]] it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's [[downfall]]. Fred [[also]] suffered a bit from casting, I love [[Adam]] Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less [[interesting]] than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.","When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited.

"[[This]] is a [[movie]] that will [[leave]] you [[thinking]], is he or isn't he? While [[many]] people have [[complained]] about the ambiguous [[ending]], it gives [[room]] for the audience to [[think]] and [[interpret]] it from the [[signs]]. [[This]] is my interpretation and theory, and I [[believe]] it is very [[sound]]. <br /><br />First, here is the plot. One [[day]], Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station. After attempting to help a woman from muggers, he is arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to [[Dr]]. [[Mark]] Powell's (Jeff [[Bridges]]) hospital. Prot [[freely]] talks about how he [[came]] from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he tells them he can [[take]] one person back with him. [[Soon]] [[Dr]]. [[Powell]] is beginning to [[question]] Prot's insanity and as the [[plot]] progresses, it is [[harder]] and harder to prove Prot [[wrong]]. <[[br]] /><[[br]] />In the [[end]], Dr. Powell [[learns]] that Prot is Robert Porter, a [[smart]] [[man]] who worked in a slaughter [[house]] in [[New]] Mexico, when his wife and daughter were [[murdered]]. Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the [[fifth]] anniversary of the murders. The time [[comes]] and [[goes]], and Powell [[finds]] Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. <br /><[[br]] />On to my theory: [[Prot]] is not [[crazy]]. Prot is from the planet [[K-Pax]]. Robert Porter is a [[friend]] of [[Prot's]]. On one of [[Prot's]] previous [[visits]] to Earth, [[Robert]] was a child, [[learning]] about the constellations from his father. [[Prot]] and [[Robert]] [[became]] best [[friends]]. After the [[death]] of his family, and Robert slaying the murderer, [[Robert]] decides to commit [[suicide]]. [[Prot]] is on K-Pax at the [[time]], but he [[rushes]] [[back]] (in multiples of [[light]] speed) to [[stop]] [[Robert]]. So Prot [[takes]] over the thinking of [[Robert]], [[taking]] over his body so to [[speak]]. [[Awhile]] later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) [[comes]] to New [[York]] and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher [[sensitivity]] to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: [[The]] sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want.

"<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when I went to watch it, it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. I think too of the people from other countries who [[dared]] spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end, ""what a piece of crap"". In order to understand Cronica de un desayuno, one has to be mexican, and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). There's nothing [[accidental]] in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in Mexico at least, share. One has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. The older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother is going to an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... The stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempt of suicide, subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... The music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a [[lot]], not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings.

"Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot, sunny day, I might add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is.<br /><br />Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both [[cheap]] and [[annoying]] as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are [[actually]] quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many [[explanations]] as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite. [[All]] that watching Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past, for [[nothing]]?. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, however crazy/stupid you might think it. If you don't watch a lot of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat, but I [[found]] this slow, [[boring]] and [[highly]] derivative. If you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it, if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter.","Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot, sunny day, I might add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is.<br /><br />Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both [[ceap]] and [[annоying]] as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are [[actualⅼy]] quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many [[explanationѕ]] as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite.

"There was a time in the US that everything was possible on film, so came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene's. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course those were made with a bit of budget.

"I [[accidentally]] happened [[upon]] this movie when I was looking for something to watch while eating lunch.

"With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors) makes his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $[[24]] million as [[opposed]] to Company's measly $25,000), [[mainstream]] realm -- and [[yet]] [[remains]] [[true]] to his [[roots]]. [[While]] his cast is now composed of A-list [[Hollywood]] names (Renee Zellweger, [[Morgan]] Freeman, and stand-up comedian [[Chris]] Rock), his material [[remains]] just as bizarre and quirky as his first two features, [[proving]] that he just may be the next big thing. [[Nurse]] [[Betty]] is one of the darkest [[comedies]] to be [[advertised]] towards a [[mainstream]] audience in years, and considering its moderate box [[office]] and critical success, perhaps moviegoers weren't as dumb and brainwashed as we though they were. The story follows (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As [[Good]] As It Gets's Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless marriage to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's sent into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to meet her object of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilos of cocaine, they hit the road as well and outrageousness ensues. Fans of LaBute's previous work [[might]] have a hard time figuring out how this could possibly be the same guy who directed In the Company of Men -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist pigs who play a practical joke on a deaf co-worker --, but when you think about it, the connection is rather clear: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly taken advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she's chasing thinks her genuine adoration is nothing more than a [[joke]]. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- considering that his recurring theme involves the downfall of innocent women. [[But]] personally, I [[think]] [[he's]] [[coming]] to the defense of the [[fair]] [[sex]] and [[dealing]] [[far]] more [[harshly]] with the abusers in his pictures than the abused. One of the many [[charms]] of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the [[supporting]] cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or [[ANY]] movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint.

"This film by the [[well-known]] Czech director and writer collaborator [[Petr]] Jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its [[details]]. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, [[15-year-old]] Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no [[fool]]. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though [[Prague-born]], owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in. This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.","This film by the [[wеll-known]] Czech director and writer collaborator [[Ptr]] Jarchovský is remarkable for its particularity but annoying and distracting in its [[detailѕ]]. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's trying to survive and protect her two children, [[15-year-ld]] Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and little blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a little lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no good explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no [[fooⅼ]]. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to jail.<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. But actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though [[Prague-boⲅn]], owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is benevolent, even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in.

"""Campfire Tales"" is basically made up of [[three]] spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic ""Hook"" story, and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each story becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come...<br /><br />In my opinion, the last story they tell is probably the [[scariest]] and had some genuine, frightening effects.

The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character -- maybe even a virtually life-saving change -- and how they both grow up in the space of a summer.",0.4945835471153259,0.6118112802505493,1,0,1,100,"Successful"
"Technically speaking, this movie sucks...lol. However, it's also hilarious. Whether or not it's intentionally funny I don't know.

"[[Mixed]] group of ""experts"" ([[explorers]], [[divers]] and [[scientists]]) venture a mile [[underground]] and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a spot [[even]] more [[remote]], where they find salamanders, giant albino [[moles]] (??) and some big, razor-fanged, winged, [[computer]] [[generated]] creatures lurking about.

"Meville's caper film is not as good as his most famous movie, the deliciously [[stylish]] ""Le Samourai (1968)."" I don't even think this is the best example of the much-loved heist subgenre. The main thing against the film is its long running time. Meville has this tendency of concentrating on too many trivial details.

Melville's direction impressed me and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very ""cool"" master thief. The movie's must-see color photography is a great asset and Melville uses sound (or lack of sound) in a very effective manner. From a technical standpoint, the movie is practically flawless.

"Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player ""Jimmy"" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns along the way between these two, as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. She is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and in no position to care for him. Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie. You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly, and it does. This film is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing ""The Godfather."" The actors are good ones, needless to say, as they all would have futures ahead of them in film. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underrated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola's, and I confess I had never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience.","Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969.

"""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"". Cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a sort of ""Folk Hero"" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.<br /><br />My primary problem with ""ODC"" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /><br />The film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. Writer Gerard Stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an Irish ""Lock Stock"" or a grittier treatment of Martin Cahill's thieving career? That's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /><br />It's also unfortunate that ""ODC"" followed the cinema release of John Boorman's ""The General"", which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.<br /><br />What IS surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a happy Hollywood-style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief Michael Lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in ""ODC"". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. <br /><br />The real Cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his ""Man of The People"" self-image. Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in ""ODC"" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.","""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"".

"The movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years.

And who [[better]] to play the troubled part than that [[great]] actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. [[But]] no [[one]] was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure.<br /><br />Lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. The suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail-biter all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many fine ""soulful"" parts that she was so good at. Instead, it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. My [[favorite]] scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting.

Then when [[Whiting]] walks in and finds the attractive-looking Ryan [[scrubbing]] the floor, she starts getting coy, flirting with her budding sexuality.

Now there's heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door, leaving Lupino to pay the price.

"This [[Oscar-winning]] short [[film]] (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to small-town Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs (obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the South around this time). [[Well]], the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and the older brother, Pete, decides to enlist. He gives his prize egg to his little [[brother]], Willie and heads off [[wishing]] to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte. Well, Willie isn't having any of it, if Pete can be a soldier so can he. He heads to Memphis, showing his [[stubbornness]] and [[determination]] as he gets the better of several adults along the way. After finding the enlistment center in Memphis, he demands to see his brother, pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process. We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan [[Furr]]). He delivers a [[impeccable]] [[performance]] as a stubborn [[strong-willed]] boy in the [[gentler]] times of yesteryear. The movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth.

"I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments.

"[[There]] were [[heist]] [[movies]] before this one, and [[indeed]] the [[likes]] of [[Rififi]] were an [[obvious]] [[influence]] on it - but [[The]] [[Red]] [[Circle]] is more than just another entry in an [[overpopulated]] genre and with this [[film]], director [[Jean-Pierre]] [[Melville]] has [[managed]] to [[create]] something that both [[thrills]] on the surface and gives its audience something to [[think]] about. Being cool is just as important a feature of the modern crime movie as guns and gangsters, and [[Melville]] delivers that with this [[film]] in droves; the [[tone]] of the film is very [[relaxed]] too and Melville allows the bulk of the film to bubble under the cool exterior. [[The]] story has a number of angles but the [[central]] character is Corey - a thief who is released from [[prison]]. His [[release]] coincides with the escape of [[infamous]] murderer Vogel, who slips from under the nose of [[Police]] Commissioner Mattei during a [[train]] [[ride]].

Poised to lose billions of dollars if word of this gets out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and/or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone.

I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction.

In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story.

"[[This]] [[production]] was quite well done for a [[television]] original, providing a very [[appropriate]] original slant on [[Swift's]] work. To make the frame story work [[well]] the [[film]] begins with [[Gulliver]] [[arriving]] [[home]]. [[Everyone]] who has read the book [[knows]] that will happen anyway. The [[frame]] story of the book has [[Gulliver's]] crazed confusion in sections. For example, he is [[horrified]] that he will [[trample]] [[little]] [[people]] in England because he has just [[returned]] from a land of giants. [[But]] the film has all the book sections [[within]] one long voyage. When [[Gulliver]] [[narrates]] his travels the [[editing]] cuts from England to the travel are very [[effective]]. I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they [[became]] [[natural]]. By the [[end]], moreover, they have become a [[welcome]] addition to the [[story]]. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more [[people]] listen to his [[compelling]] fantasy [[even]] though they doubt its truth. [[For]] example, his hatred of [[filthy]] Yahoos and admiration of [[pure]] logic from the [[fourth]] section comes [[across]] well when he is defending his own sanity. [[The]] intercuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale is very [[effective]]. [[For]] [[example]], ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is [[inspired]] filming. [[The]] addition of [[Gulliver's]] family threatened by the lecherous [[doctor]] works well. Swift only hints at this by having the [[long-suffering]] wife protest against further voyages. [[It]] becomes a [[natural]] part of this [[story]]. The casting and acting were competent throughout. Some roles were [[exemplary]]. Omar [[Sharif's]] [[mad]] magician is superb. [[O'Toole's]] little emperor is doddering [[delightfully]] toward senility. [[Many]] [[specific]] [[complaints]] made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. I read the [[abridged]] version [[several]] times a year from fourth grade on. I may have [[escaped]] the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times [[since]]. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. While the [[Danson]] version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the [[book]]. However, I [[think]] it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the [[book]], [[enjoy]] this movie then [[go]] to the source. If you [[appreciate]] the [[satire]] in it, find [[Swift's]] ""A Modest Proposal"" and his ""[[Drapier's]] Letters."" [[Both]] are satires attacking the [[wretched]] treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland. These were Wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's [[torturous]] experiences a chance. I think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.","[[Thiѕ]] [[produc𝚝ion]] was quite well done for a [[televiѕion]] original, providing a very [[appropria𝚝e]] original slant on [[Switf's]] work. To make the frame story work [[welⅼ]] the [[filｍ]] begins with [[Gulilver]] [[arriѵing]] [[hoｍe]]. [[Eveⲅyone]] who has read the book [[knowѕ]] that will happen anyway. The [[fraｍe]] story of the book has [[Gulliver`s]] crazed confusion in sections. For example, he is [[horrifieԁ]] that he will [[trampⅼe]] [[littⅼe]] [[peopⅼe]] in England because he has just [[returneԁ]] from a land of giants. [[Bu𝚝]] the film has all the book sections [[wi𝚝hin]] one long voyage. When [[Gluliver]] [[na]] [[rrates]] his travels the [[edi𝚝ing]] cuts from England to the travel are very [[effectiѵe]]. I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first, then they [[becaｍe]] [[naturaⅼ]]. By the [[enԁ]], moreover, they have become a [[welcoｍe]] addition to the [[stoⲅy]]. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more [[peopⅼe]] listen to his [[compelⅼing]] fantasy [[eѵen]] though they doubt its truth. [[Fr]] example, his hatred of [[fil𝚝hy]] Yahoos and admiration of [[pre]] logic from the [[four𝚝h]] section comes [[acrosѕ]] well when he is defending his own sanity. [[Tհe]] intercuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale is very [[effectiѵe]]. [[Fr]] [[exampⅼe]], ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is [[inspireԁ]] filming. [[Te]] addition of [[Gulilver's]] family threatened by the lecherous [[doctoⲅ]] works well. Swift only hints at this by having the [[long˗suffering]] wife protest against further voyages. [[I𝚝]] becomes a [[naturaⅼ]] part of this [[stoⲅy]]. The casting and acting were competent throughout. Some roles were [[exemplaⲅy]]. Omar [[Shari𝚏's]] [[md]] magician is superb. [[O'Tooⅼe's]] little emperor is doddering [[delightfullу]] toward senility. [[May]] [[specifiϲ]] [[complaintѕ]] made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are about here. I read the [[abrіdged]] version [[se]] [[veral]] times a year from fourth grade on. I may have [[escapeԁ]] the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times [[sinϲe]]. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. While the [[Dan]] [[son]] version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the [[b]] [[ook]]. However, I [[thin𝒌]] it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the [[boo𝒌]], [[enϳoy]] this movie then [[ɡo]] to the source. If you [[apprecia𝚝e]] the [[satiⲅe]] in it, find [[Swift'ѕ]] ""A Modest Proposal"" and his ""[[Drapieⲅ's]] Letters."" [[Bo𝚝h]] are satires attacking the [[w]] [[retched]] treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests cheap, inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland. These were Wood's light weight coinage, not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's [[tor]] [[turous]] experiences a chance.

"Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a [[disappointing]] only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far.

"I have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,<br /><br />""An American Werewolf In London."" That film had it's funny moments, it was still more of horror tale than anything else. This updated version, now set in Paris, does not have that ""edge"" at all and simply isn't in the same class....but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch. <br /><br />So, ""werewolf purists"" aside, most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the London version, I'll still give it decent marks since I don't care what others think. I [[liked]] it [[even]] though I agree ""London"" is better and I prefer that version, too. <br /><br />The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a ""balloon"" in a restaurant. It also introduces the lead female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't seem to make that many films, or least ones I hear about over here in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film got points for having her in it, and she looks great.<br /><br />When the horror starts, it can get scary and the special effects are good. I also liked the lack of profanity in this film, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing!<br /><br />However, there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle-aged guy like me, either. This film is geared a lot more toward 20-somethings, if that helps anyone.<br /><br />It's [[entertaining]].....just don't [[expect]] it to live up to the first film.","I have mixed emotions about this film, especially as it compares to its forerunner,<br /><br />""An American Werewolf In London.""

For a [[start]] I think Jacqueline Hyde was/is intended to be a [[horror]] film, the [[IMDb]] certainly lists it as such but there isn't any [[horror]] in it at all apart from just how [[bad]] it is.

Why, that's the question I ask here. [[It's]] not even [[good]] porn either, [[besides]] being [[far]] too soft it's dull, [[boring]] & the [[not-worth-mentioning]] sex scenes are few & [[far]] between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the [[title]] which would have been quite clever if not for the [[fact]] that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot [[better]] than this piece of [[rubbish]]. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow [[via]] more terrible CGI.

The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. [[The]] acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a [[load]] of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of.

Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. [[T]] [[he]] acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a [[l]] [[oad]] of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of.

"""It all depends on how you look at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell,"" says the priest Rev. Harlan in ""Northfork."" The Polish brothers' film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up, provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of Christianity. The layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back American to reflect on current social values. The film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the depths of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who nearly ""crucify"" their feet to wooden floor of their homes, angels who need multiple glasses to read, etc.) and absurd images (of half animals, half toys that are alive, of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp, a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts, etc.) could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment.

"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. The writer/director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />Lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical ""last big night"" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go off to college. One thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There's a disposition of time, like in Nick Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. ""More American Graffiti"" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) off in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. Instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on New Years Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to become confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.<br /><br />The best parts of the movie to me are the ones with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. A good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. It was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why Curt isn't in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There's a black kind of satire to some of the Vietnam stuff, very similar to what I would imagine Lucas and John Milius' original idea for ""Apocalypse Now"" would have been like. And there's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. It just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and so many better films.<br /><br />Like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are great, and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see -- I wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? I couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I guess I have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as I remember it being. It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of ""American Graffiti"" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as ""American Graffiti"" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.","I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be.

It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of ""American Graffiti"" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as ""American Graffiti"" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.",0.6588577628135681,0.6588577628135681,1,1,0,1,"Skipped"

"I [[tend]] to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's [[reputation]] as a director. Too [[often]] [[he's]] [[categorized]] as a no-talented filmmaker, only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. [[True]], his films [[contain]] more explicit filth and [[sickness]] as your [[average]] mainstream American production, but his [[films]] [[always]] are of [[wide]] [[range]] and the plots are [[gruesomely]] [[morbid]]. Don't [[Torture]] a Duckling is yet another story! [[This]] film is a [[pure]] [[gem]] of the [[Italian]] [[shock]] [[cinema]]! I [[easily]] dare to [[call]] this film a masterpieceit's an [[old-fashioned]] giallo that includes all [[brilliant]] [[aspects]] of genuine [[horror]]. The film [[shows]] the [[search]] for a inhuman [[serial]] murderer in a small [[Italian]] [[mountain-town]]. The bodies of [[3]] young boys are [[found]], [[horribly]] mutilated. There are quite a [[lot]] of pseudo-madmen in the [[town]] but every [[trail]] leads to nowhere. [[Among]] the suspects are a greedy bum and a [[scary]] woman, obsessed by witchery and voodoo.

"PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing [[plot]] line and [[horrible]] [[acting]].<br /><br />First, let's tackle the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. However, it becomes completely [[unknown]] to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. Before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an ""acclaimed"" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for [[much]]. You're also not allowing the character to develop very well.<br /><br />Beth's [[character]], played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even [[worse]]. [[Dreiling]] shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her [[character]] [[whatsoever]]. [[When]] being [[harassed]] by her [[principal]], she knocks him down (after several [[seconds]]) with no feelings of [[disgust]] or [[shock]] or [[anything]] equally traumatizing. Her [[lines]] are [[read]] [[like]] she is reading trivia off the [[back]] of a [[cereal]] box.<br /><[[br]] />[[Throughout]] the [[rest]] of the film, the students in [[charge]] of his [[kidnapping]] [[sound]] more like they are [[planning]] a [[barbecue]] than [[deciding]] what they will do with their [[principal]], sitting [[tied]] up in their basement.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Meanwhile]], Cherry is off [[killing]] several female [[prom]] queen [[candidates]], and no one [[even]] notices or [[cares]]. (Yeah, I get it, I get it, the [[whole]] [[town]] is worried about [[prom]]. Very realistic. At [[least]] you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too [[much]].) For example, [[right]] after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of [[students]], [[Beth]] is [[found]] being interviewed by the local [[media]]. [[The]] reporter [[mentions]] ""the shooter"" in a way that [[makes]] it [[seem]] [[like]] no one knows who killed these [[innocent]] [[students]], but then [[one]] [[second]] later asks, ""[[What]] do you think about [[guns]] in the [[hands]] of [[minors]]?"" or [[something]] to that [[effect]]. [[Where]] did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /><br />At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that ""she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard"" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. [[No]] one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.<br /><br />Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their ""I'm so indie and mod"" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic.<br /><br />The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.<br /><[[br]] />Too bad the acting and script aren't.","PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing [[plo𝚝]] line and [[horribⅼe]] [[ac𝚝ing]].<br /><br />First, let's tackle the characters.

Why does she care so much to be their prom queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an ""acclaimed"" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for [[muϲh]]. You're also not allowing the character to develop very well.<br /><br />Beth's [[characteⲅ]], played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even [[worѕe]]. [[Dreiⅼing]] shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her [[characteⲅ]] [[whatsoeveⲅ]]. [[Wen]] being [[harasseԁ]] by her [[principaⅼ]], she knocks him down (after several [[secondѕ]]) with no feelings of [[disgus𝚝]] or [[shoc𝒌]] or [[anуthing]] equally traumatizing. Her [[lineѕ]] are [[rad]] [[lie]] she is reading trivia off the [[bac𝒌]] of a [[cereaⅼ]] box.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />[[Throughou𝚝]] the [[res𝚝]] of the film, the students in [[chaⲅge]] of his [[kіdnapping]] [[sonud]] more like they are [[pⅼanning]] a [[barbeϲue]] than [[decidinɡ]] what they will do with their [[principɑl]], sitting [[ted]] up in their basement.<[[Ьr]] /><[[bⲅ]] />[[Meanwhiⅼe]], Cherry is off [[killinɡ]] several female [[proｍ]] queen [[candidateѕ]], and no one [[eѵen]] notices or [[careѕ]]. (Yeah, I get it, I get it, the [[whoⅼe]] [[toԝn]] is worried about [[proｍ]]. Very realistic. At [[lesat]] you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too [[muϲh]].) For example, [[righ𝚝]] after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of [[studentѕ]], [[Be𝚝h]] is [[fond]] being interviewed by the local [[mdeia]]. [[Thе]] reporter [[metnions]] ""the shooter"" in a way that [[makeѕ]] it [[seeｍ]] [[li𝒌e]] no one knows who killed these [[innocen𝚝]] [[studentѕ]], but then [[оne]] [[seconԁ]] later asks, ""[[Waht]] do you think about [[gunѕ]] in the [[hnds]] of [[minrs]]?"" or [[some𝚝hing]] to that [[efefct]]. [[Were]] did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /><br />At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that ""she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard"" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. [[Nо]] one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.<br /><br />Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their ""I'm so indie and mod"" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic.<br /><br />The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />Too bad the acting and script aren't.",0.024047553539276123,0.5016165971755981,0,1,0,2339,"Successful"

It would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie.

Toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt.

"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.<br /><br />I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.<br /><br />Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />Characters are similarly hammered home, particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying.

And the guys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers.<br /><br />It's also funny the way they renamed the octopus to an octosack, the orangutan to orangapoid, and the tiger to a tigron. There's even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature who threatens Flash on a couple of occasions before being killed off).<br /><[[br]] />You like the [[Invisible]] Man? [[This]] has [[got]] you [[covered]]. You like sword fights, [[wrestling]] (both animals & men), fist fights? [[Plenty]] for any taste. We have an underwater city, a sky city, a city on top of a mountain, and tonnes of [[secret]] passages and caves.<br /><br />Hokey effects? [[Massive]] amounts. The sky city is [[supported]] by radium furnaces stoked like [[old-time]] steamships. The rocketships are ""powered"" by fireworks and have constant backfires and/or humming noises. Lots of wires are visible [[holding]] things up ([[like]] food when Flash was invisible and of course rocketships). [[There's]] clouds out in space, but none around the earth when viewed from Mongo. ""Giant"" lizards show up briefly. Fighting sea creatures supposedly threaten Flash & co. on the way to the [[shark-men's]] underwater city. The ""gadgets"" in Dr. [[Zarkov's]] lab crack me up. And they seem to be the same ones no matter what lab he's in (he worked in Ming's lab and Vultan's).<br /><br />And yeah, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) just not the person she would have preferred. In fact, it seems a lot of the sub-plots concern intrigue on the part of Princess Aura to try to win Flash.<br /><br />Man I think the characters are awesome. That fat, horse-laughing, King Vultan was hilarious. How he managed those wings was pure artistry. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They should have had him for the emperor in Starwars. Ming has got to be my favourite character in this serial. Princess Aura was quite a little character too. And she pulled it off nicely. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by a long shot. Even the sneaky high priest had a distinctive role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character---and he always stood in the background during fight scenes holding Dale. Now we get to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero---and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fit him perfectly.<br /><br />After watching this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. Watch this, you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />If you ever considered watching an old serial (or any serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. The only reason I didn't give this one a 10 is because of a few story holes that could have been fixed easily, the way the giant lizards seemed just tacked in there, and a couple of weak characters (king of shark-men & king of lion-men).","My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes.

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are [[lousy]] dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final film is a letdown.","Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.

"Wow! the French are really getting the hang of it. If we look at their first Asterix movie we see a good story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu)but very lame special effect.

"If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And [[that's]] just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It doesn't help that the class [[stereotypes]] which help define the enlisted [[men]] from the [[officers]] can be jarring. Here, as in so [[many]] other [[British]] war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an [[educated]] fluency that would place them at home in [[England's]] [[finest]] ruling-class establishments. In this [[movie]], [[Freddie]] [[Taylor]] (John Mills), the captain of the [[submarine]] Sea Tiger, is [[clever]], confident, resourceful, [[aggressive]], in [[control]], [[good]] with his [[men]], [[humorous]] with his [[peers]], quick to make a decision. [[And]] it [[helps]] that he's lucky. [[His]] [[men]] are [[jolly]] [[tars]], for the most part, competent at their jobs and [[always]] ready with a joke when [[things]] [[get]] tense. Although we spend the [[first]] third of the [[movie]] getting to know these people while [[they're]] on leave, after that [[things]] get tense quickly. <br /><br />Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a [[new]] [[German]] [[battleship]]. They just miss the ship when it enters the [[Kiel]] Canal and heads into the [[Baltic]]. [[Taylor]] assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it, through [[mine]] fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to [[home]] base. [[After]] [[several]] [[tense]] situations, the [[confrontation]] [[takes]] [[place]]. [[The]] Sea Tiger [[lets]] [[loose]] six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. After a [[clever]] [[subterfuge]], Taylor [[outfoxes]] a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not [[enough]] [[fuel]]. He plans to scuttle his [[sub]] and surrender when, just at the last moment, [[James]] Hobson (Eric [[Portman]]), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who [[speaks]] German, says there is a [[small]] [[Danish]] coastal village that had been a fuel depot. He [[thinks]] it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <[[br]] /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of [[Our]] Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like [[We]] Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.","If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top, among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And [[that`s]] just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film, We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It doesn't help that the class [[stereotypeѕ]] which help define the enlisted [[mn]] from the [[officerѕ]] can be jarring. Here, as in so [[ｍany]] other [[Britiѕh]] war films, the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an [[educateԁ]] fluency that would place them at home in [[England`s]] [[fines𝚝]] ruling-class establishments. In this [[moѵie]], [[Freddіe]] [[Tayloⲅ]] (John Mills), the captain of the [[submaⲅine]] Sea Tiger, is [[cleveⲅ]], confident, resourceful, [[aggressiѵe]], in [[controⅼ]], [[gooԁ]] with his [[mn]], [[humorouѕ]] with his [[peerѕ]], quick to make a decision. [[Anԁ]] it [[helpѕ]] that he's lucky. [[Hs]] [[mn]] are [[jolⅼy]] [[t]] [[ars]], for the most part, competent at their jobs and [[alwayѕ]] ready with a joke when [[thingѕ]] [[gt]] tense. Although we spend the [[firs𝚝]] third of the [[moѵie]] getting to know these people while [[tհey're]] on leave, after that [[thingѕ]] get tense quickly. <br /><br />Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a [[neԝ]] [[Gerｍan]] [[battleѕhip]]. They just miss the ship when it enters the [[Kieⅼ]] Canal and heads into the [[Baltiϲ]]. [[Tayloⲅ]] assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it, through [[ｍine]] fields, anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to [[hoｍe]] base. [[Afteⲅ]] [[severaⅼ]] [[tenѕe]] situations, the [[confronta𝚝ion]] [[takeѕ]] [[pace]]. [[Te]] Sea Tiger [[letѕ]] [[lose]] six torpedoes but has to dive, not knowing if it had done its job. After a [[cleveⲅ]] [[subter𝚏uge]], Taylor [[outf]] [[oxes]] a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not [[еnough]] [[fueⅼ]]. He plans to scuttle his [[sb]] and surrender when, just at the last moment, [[Jameѕ]] Hobson (Eric [[Porman]]), a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who [[sрeaks]] German, says there is a [[smalⅼ]] [[Daniѕh]] coastal village that had been a fuel depot. He [[thinkѕ]] it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <[[bⲅ]] /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of [[O]] [[ur]] Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like [[Wе]] Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war.

That's not to [[say]] that there isn't [[still]] [[plenty]] of action - [[Scorpion]] [[still]] [[spends]] a [[lot]] of time in 'revenge mode' and the [[film]] isn't exactly short on general sleaze.

"**SPOILERS** The third and mercifully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28, 1960! Still that didn't stop Gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.<br /><br />In ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the Aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.<br /><br />After getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films, we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as ""The Bat"". Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world.

"The Best Years of Our Life is [[often]] compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be.

([[How]] [[many]] [[people]] know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 [[years]].

Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to [[work]] terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. [[Each]] could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><[[br]] />[[The]] moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to [[give]] [[advice]]. The obvious [[case]] is when Derry told Herald to [[marry]] the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. [[It]] is hard for Harold to [[believe]] that anyone could love him when he had been a football [[hero]] and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.<br /><br />The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.<br /><br />Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.<br /><br />All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.<br /><br />I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.","The Best Years of Our Life is [[of]] [[ten]] compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be.

[[Eacհ]] could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />[[T]] [[he]] moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to [[gіve]] [[advіce]]. The obvious [[caѕe]] is when Derry told Herald to [[mɑrry]] the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. [[I𝚝]] is hard for Harold to [[belieѵe]] that anyone could love him when he had been a football [[heⲅo]] and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.<br /><br />The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.<br /><br />Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.<br /><br />All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.<br /><br />I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.",0.03554117679595947,0.5312962532043457,1,0,1,1035,"Successful"

"Spoiler [[Alert]] - although this is a plot almost as impossible to [[spoil]] as it is to [[completely]] explain.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />'[[Mulholland]] Drive' is by far the most [[successful]] expression of David Lynch's cinematographic style and [[vision]] since the [[first]] season of his '[[Twin]] [[Peaks']] TV [[series]]. As [[Lynch]] [[enthusiasts]] know, his is a style and [[vision]] [[uniquely]] blended from [[film]] [[noir]], horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology  with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and [[black]] humor thrown in for good measure. All these elements are richly at work in '[[Mulholland]] Drive,' making for a riveting, hair-raising, and [[highly]] satisfying film experience  [[especially]] if one does not [[become]] overly obsessed with trying to make all the [[plot]] pieces fit into a logical, [[mystery-unraveling]] whole.<br /><br />[[The]] film [[features]] [[wonderful]] [[performances]] by Naomi [[Watts]] and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young [[women]] [[whose]] lives [[intersect]] in various ways [[amid]] a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of [[contemporary]] reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical [[self-aggrandizement]]. Their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the [[film's]] opening scene, in which [[Harring's]] character [[escapes]] an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to [[mention]] horrific, [[automobile]] accident. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset [[Boulevard]] (the [[two]] most archetypal of Hollywood [[thoroughfares]]), she [[finds]] her way to the very apartment that [[Betty]] (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her 'Aunt [[Ruth]],' a purportedly successful actress who is off to [[Canada]] to begin a new movie. As we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.<br /><br />A [[highly]] [[energetic]] and [[stylized]] flashback to the contest forms one of two [[pre-credit]] prologue sequences that frame Betty's descent from the clichéd would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned [[lover]] and [[going]] nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the [[Harring]] character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the [[film]] noir [[classic]] 'Gilda' that adorns [[Aunt]] [[Ruth's]] apartment. (Actually, it turns out [[Aunt]] [[Ruth]] has [[long]] since deceased and whose [[apartment]] we're really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local [[Winkies]] restaurant (a [[recurring]] location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a [[recollection]] of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful.

"Well, it's safe to say that Subconscious Cruelty is one weird film! Supposedly an insight into the human [[mind]], Subconscious Cruelty is [[comprises]] [[four]] [[macabre]] and bizarre tales of the extreme. The first segment, entitled 'Ovarian Eyeball' is really just a warm up, but it's good in that it gives the viewer an idea of what to expect from the next three segments. It simply sees a naked woman laid out on a table, while another woman cuts into her abdomen and pulls out a human eyeball! I've got no idea what the point is, but it certainly makes for [[visceral]] viewing. [[The]] following story is the [[best]] of the bunch, and takes in the ""old favourite"" sick movie theme of incest. The [[segment]] [[follows]] a man who lives alone with his pregnant sister. He's repulsed by her pregnancy - yet he wants to have sex with her anyway, and naturally he gets his way. This story [[stands]] out because of the monotonous and 'matter of fact' narration, as well as the ending - which doesn't [[fail]] to deliver the shocks. This segment is well acted, well filmed and easily the highlight of Subconscious Cruelty.<br /><br />Naturally, the next two sections aren't as good as the second one; so the only way from there is down, but director Karim Hussain still manages to pull something out of the bag before the film ends. He doesn't do it right away, however, as the third segment is the weakest of the film, and simply sees a lot of people have sex with the ground. It's very surreal, and therefore memorable for that same reason; but there doesn't seem to be a lot of point to it, and I was in the mood for something a bit more morbid after the second section. The film ends on a [[high]], however, as while I'm not entirely sure what the point was - the final segment features the [[film's]] best imagery.

"[[The]] [[greatest]] movie ever.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[How's]] that for a [[contention]]? However, if we look at it through purely cinematic terms, it is clear that [[Three]] Colours Red is a [[masterpiece]]. It is not enough to [[merely]] say this - [[Three]] [[Colours]] Red is the masterpiece of [[world]] cinema. If you [[accept]] that Citizen Kane is not [[human]] enough, if you accept that [[Star]] Wars is not actually very good, if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to [[take]] a step back - then [[Three]] Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion into human morality, Three [[Colours]] Red works on an [[intensely]] metaphysical level, with a depth that none can [[match]]. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced [[us]] to reflect on the [[humanity]] of equality - this, in [[retrospect]], was better still, but [[still]] not [[quite]] there. Red, however, is the real thing. What he expresses in this movie, is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail, the very nature of our souls, of our [[ethical]] [[selves]]. In [[Red]], one may find meaning on one of its [[several]] levels. On the [[first]] level, [[Red]] achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no [[trouble]] in calling [[Red]] an [[exceptionally]] entertaining story. However, the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force [[us]] to [[examine]] the movie as a movie. It is as if [[Kieslowski]] is [[saying]]: ""Ceci n'est [[pas]] [[la]] réalité"". In effect, in pursuing a humanistic [[goal]], [[Kieslowski]] can [[also]] challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double [[Vie]] de Véronique, but not until this, his final [[film]], did he [[finally]] manage to reach this [[divine]] [[intertwining]] of [[fate]], [[philosophy]] and circumstance. The actors and actresses, too, appear to be at the mercy of a [[greater]] power. Valentine (Irène [[Jacob]]), is aptly name, for she seems to represent an [[almost]] [[pure]] love. [[Meanwhile]], the idea of [[first]] impressions is challenged by [[Jean-Louis]] [[Tritignant's]] Judge [[Kern]], a cantankerous man, who, by the [[end]], becomes an [[almost]] all-knowing observer of events - a [[character]] who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy, a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.<br /><br />We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. In fact, films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. It won't happen, of course, but at least we have the power to view this film, knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the [[something]] that we can't define, but all possess.

"An Asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before getting run over by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, given a hilarious ""Southern belle"" dub to show she's from Alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (Robert Kerman i.e. American porn star R. Bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. After barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who's under the control of Jim Jones-type cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov).

"How any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. I made an account on IMDb just to comment on this cr@p film. The acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p.

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], starting with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no sense of the period. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.","One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no.

"This adaption contains two parts: <br /><br />1. The ""now"" time, when Gulliver is at home in England and soon is put into a mental asylum by the Evil Dr. Bates <br /><br />2. The ""described"" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels.<br /><br />The times are interspersed with a very choppy tempo, which makes willing suspense of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie simply would have discarded that part, and followed the book as written. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs Gulliver gets very little mention. The travels - in plural - are depicted as one in the movie. There are several movies covering the topic of sane people dumped into asylum by some nasty person out there, look at them if you want that stuff.

My best guess is that CGI was so costly back in 1996 so that the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of filler which did not need elaborate sets, GCI, etc. in order to keep total costs under some limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series which clocked in at some set number of minutes.","This adaption contains two parts: <br /><br />1.

You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours.

The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing.

"Set in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this [[film]] portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton ([[Gerard]] Depardieu, at his [[finest]]) and Robespierre (a [[commanding]] [[performance]] by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to ""The Reign Of Terror"" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by [[guillotine]], who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film ""Man Of Iron"" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason [[opposed]] to [[Robespierre]]/[[Jaruselski]] who continue dictatorial rule despite having [[lost]] the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play ""The Danton Affair"" written by Stanislawa [[Przybyszewska]] in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical.

Don't be fooled be the movie's cool H.R. Gigeresque [[cover]]. [[This]] is so [[bad]], it's almost [[hilarious]]. I can't describe all the emotions this movie conjured.

[[The]] [[best]] thing of this [[movie]] are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less [[okay]] CGI of [[two]] space-ships. But when [[Casper]] Van Dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling [[something]] fishy. [[And]], indeed, it all goes [[downhill]] rapidly after that.<br /><br />[[The]] crew of a [[salvage-spaceship]] finds an abandoned vessel, the Demeter, which [[seems]] to be heading for [[earth]]. [[They]] enter it, thus sealing their [[fate]]. [[This]] movie is, above all things, a shameless [[low-budget]] [[ALIEN-rip-off]], mixed with [[vampires]]. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak's [[character]], Aurora, reveals she's a robot. [[Coolio]] goes [[badly]] over-the-top as the dope-smoking, [[bloodsucking]] 187 ([[pffff]], code from the hood as a [[name]]?!?!). [[Casper]] Van Dien's character's [[named]] Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he [[looks]] like...,[[er]] well, [[Casper]] Van Dien. Udo [[Kier]] as [[Capt]]. Varna, former commander of the Demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he [[really]] does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock, one of the most pathetic and [[laughable]] Dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black [[suit]] or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.","...and that's a goddamn shame!

I laughed my ass off, I yelled at the screen, I [[st]] there numb, nodding my head in disbelief,... [[Tis]] film has '[[ϲheap]] & cheese' written all over it. [[Te]] [[bet]] thing of this [[move]] are the opening-credits and the opening-shots which feature more or less [[o𝒌ay]] CGI of [[to]] space-ships. But when [[Capser]] Van Dien's voice-over comes on, you start smelling [[somethіng]] fishy. [[Ad]], indeed, it all goes [[downhіll]] rapidly after that.<br /><br />[[T]] [[he]] crew of a [[salvagespaceship]] finds an abandoned vessel, the Demeter, which [[sees]] to be heading for [[erath]]. [[Thеy]] enter it, thus sealing their [[fa𝚝e]]. [[Thiѕ]] movie is, above all things, a shameless [[low-budge𝚝]] [[ALIENr-ip-off]], mixed with [[vamрires]]. Right down to the plot-twist were Erika Eleniak's [[characteⲅ]], Aurora, reveals she's a robot. [[Cooliо]] goes [[bad]] [[ly]] over-the-top as the dope-smoking, [[bloodsuking]] 187 ([[pfff𝚏]], code from the hood as a [[nmae]]?!?!). [[Caspeⲅ]] Van Dien's character's [[namd]] Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) and he [[lookѕ]] like...,[[еr]] well, [[Cas]] [[per]] Van Dien. Udo [[Kieⲅ]] as [[Cat]]. Varna, former commander of the Demeter, is only shown on a monitor-screen and he [[realⅼy]] does seem to have trouble reading his lines from an auto-cue (poor Udo, what where you doing in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as count Orlock, one of the most pathetic and [[laughablе]] Dracula's ever to (dis)grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black [[s]] [[uit]] or something, he's wearing a cheap old-school Halloween-suit with fringes. You thought Richard Roxburgh was unconvincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? Then wait until you see Langley's performance!<br /><br />The set-designers went overboard on this one. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times. And everyone claiming that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire-movie of the new millennium clearly is insane, or just hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.",0.023946702480316162,0.564836859703064,0,1,0,1212,"Successful"

"Perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be ""The International Year of the Cinematic Crocodile""!

"For producer [[David]] O. Selznick, no one director would ever do. Hence, on ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) we [[get]] two  [[Charles]] Vidor and John Huston. Though both men were quite accomplished in their own right, neither could make head or tail of this [[disastrous]] [[remake]] of [[Hemmingway's]] magnum opus. Hemmingway in [[general]] has never translated well from book to screen. But under [[Selznick's]] zeal to [[transform]] it into his next 'Gone With The Wind' the excursion is both punishing and exhaustive. At this [[point]] in [[Selznick's]] career, he was no longer the titan who could take ""box office poison"" and transform it into Gone With [[The]] Wind. Tired, frail, minus his studio, and, with an impending sense that his [[second]] marriage to [[Jennifer]] Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick handed the [[creative]] reigns of this flick over to Fox Studios  but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the set.<br /><br />By now one is, or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, Catharine Barkley ([[Jennifer]] Jones) and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent's tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and [[dull]]. In the final reel, [[Jones']] facial contortions during [[child]] birth are so [[bad]] I am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general [[release]]. Part of the problem with Jones is that at thirty-eight she's far too wise to play the optimistic Catharine with any great conviction. Yet, [[older]] actresses have [[frequently]] managed to make an [[audience]] forget discrepancies in age. Not so with Jones. One is painfully aware that she doesn't fit the bill in either acting chops or years invested on this planet. Hudson's laconic charm is hopelessly out of touch with to stoicism of an army soldier whose heart is broken but head remains strong. The supporting cast is peppered with such luminaries as Vittorio De Sica and Mercedes McCambridge, but these are wasted bits of [[nonsense]] that in no way reflect upon the formidable talents of either actor and best made evident elsewhere in their canons of film making.<br /><br />The anamorphic picture element for ""A Farewell to Arms"" looks good enough, though there's just a bit too much film grain present in certain scenes for this reviewer's liking. Overall, colors are subtle and muted, though balanced in accordance with the DeLuxe color processing employed at this time. Some fading is evident. Flesh tones don't appear very natural.

"In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no name cast and I do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films. I mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget. So what does one expect? Hitchcock?<br /><br />I felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list. That list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously. THe movie The Oscar comes to mind, most of Sylvester Stallone's movies. THe two leads were not Hepburn and Tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie. The woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played anal retentive professor was no Clifton Webb but he did a god job. And the Bimbo's for lack of a better were played by two competent actors. I laughed at the 50 cent special effects. But that was part of the charm of the movie. It played like a hybrid Tremors meets Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the 50's. A Meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have Giant Ants, Lobsters, rocks or Lizards terrorizing the locals. A meteor was the cause of the problems this time. I was was very entertained. I didn't expect much and I go a lot more then I bargained for.","In defense of this movie I must repeat what I had stated previously.

"OK, first of all, who in their [[right]] [[mind]] would [[remake]] Hitchcock and second, who [[would]] do it shot for [[shot]]? I admit I had no [[intention]] of ever [[watching]] this movie for that very reason. [[The]] original Psycho is [[one]] of my [[favorite]] [[films]] ever and this just seemed like a [[degrading]] photocopy of it. I did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five [[minutes]] into this crap that it was awful. First, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. [[Where's]] originality? Why remake a movie that is almost perfect EXACTLY the way it was done the [[first]] [[time]]? Why remake such a movie to begin with? If you [[ARE]] going to [[remake]] [[something]], remake something that doesn't work and make it BETTER!<br /><br />Second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. The dialog no longer works. It [[works]] fine and [[sounds]] perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of [[modern]] [[actors]]. Why not update the dialog? Hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. <br /><[[br]] />[[This]] film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson's performance as the [[car]] salesman in the original. All the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. [[Vince]] Vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than Anthony Perkins, but in doing so, you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for Norman. Having Norman masturbate while watching [[Marion]] undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that I [[think]] Tony [[Perkins]] captured so well in his [[performance]]. [[Viggo]] [[Mortensen's]] accent was annoying and [[Rita]] Wilson was far too old to [[play]] [[Caroline]]. Her [[lines]] came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun [[like]] [[Patricia]] [[Hitchcock's]] [[performance]]. <[[br]] /><[[br]] />The only [[good]] [[thing]] I saw about the film was that [[Gus]] Van Sant was able to open the movie with the shot Hitch had [[envisioned]]. Hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over Phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of [[shots]] [[cross-dissolved]] together. This film [[fulfilled]] that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. [[After]] that, though the film became a [[worthless]] [[waste]] of celluloid. <br /><br />If you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, watch this, but do NOT under any circumstances watch this BEFORE you watch the original. This is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been [[green-lit]]. Stick to the master's film, not the imitation.","OK, first of all, who in their [[righ𝚝]] [[minԁ]] would [[rema𝒌e]] Hitchcock and second, who [[woulԁ]] do it shot for [[sho𝚝]]?

The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a [[senseless]] [[mess]]. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the ""actress"" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.","There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing.

"It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances - no single performance can be right', but some can be [[wrong]], and this one is.

"***SPOILERS*** ***[[SPOILERS***]] Some bunch of Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area.

If all they need was something hard, they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form.

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routine]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both went on to become regulars on ""The Rockford Files"".","Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routіne]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting.

Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. ""Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!"" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is ""a gay arcadia of happy girls."" Sim was [[o]] [[ne]] of Britain's great [[eccentic]] actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.",0.03153592348098755,0.5416624546051025,1,0,1,1848,"Successful"

"The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the second world war, a unique setting, with a couple of British agents being held by the Germans in a farm house. Since they aren't technically at war yet, it seems as if both sides must have realized what was coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray [[Milland]]) escape into the countryside and split up. Milland happens upon gypsy woman Marlene Dietrich one evening as she's alone at her camp preparing dinner. Their encounter is an [[amazing]] and [[captivating]] [[scene]], not so much for [[Milland]] but for Dietrich, who takes sexy sultriness to a whole new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy in order to hide from the Germans, but he remains committed to his mission, to do with locating the scientist who knows the formula for a new poison gas but who also isn't a committed Nazi. The Hollywood take on gypsy life and customs is predictably portrayed, but the underlying knowledge that they would be one of the targets for extermination by the Nazis adds a certain [[tension]]. The film straddles the line between being a serious story about the poison gas and the urgent search to get the formula, and a [[colorful]] [[though]] not too convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, they're both very good; it's the fault of the film that didn't give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism, relying on and exploiting obvious cultural differences for questionable comedic purposes. Nonetheless, there are some [[tense]] and [[interesting]] [[points]] here and there, the surprise meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich does a great palm reading and Milland nearly as good faking one, and a dinner party of Germans of various stripes at which the announcement comes over the radio that Germany had been attacked by Poland and everyone stands and does a stiff arm [[salute]].

""[[Kramer]] vs. [[Kramer]]"" [[focuses]] on it and [[asks]] us to [[understand]] why we do it and why that makes it so [[troubling]]. [[That's]] a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn [[something]] so [[real]] into something that can [[capture]] our attention and then [[make]] us not feel spiteful as the [[mirror]] is held up to our face. [[Writer]]/[[director]] Robert Benton [[definitely]] achieves both and in [[impressive]] fashion in [[adapting]] this novel by [[Avery]] [[Corman]].<[[br]] /><br />[[The]] [[story]], as one would expect, is [[quite]] simple: Big business [[advertising]] man [[Ted]] [[Kramer]] (Dustin [[Hoffman]]) comes [[home]] to [[find]] his wife Joanna (Meryl [[Streep]]) is leaving him and their [[7-year-old]] [[son]] [[Billy]] (Justin Henry). Ted then [[must]] quickly learn to be an [[active]] father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.<br /><br />To make an [[Oscar-winning]] drama about something so generic and [[particularly]] dialogue- heavy first takes [[tremendous]] [[acting]] talent. [[You]] don't [[get]] much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this [[role]]: his [[first]] Oscar [[win]] after [[three]] other [[notable]] [[nominations]]. He creates a [[thorough]] [[character]], one [[whose]] self-centered and [[quick-tempered]] ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the [[sole]] care-giver. Streep [[wins]] her first Oscar in only the [[second]] major role of her career as a woman who doesn't [[get]] [[much]] screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to [[leave]] as [[well]] as renewed sense of identity when she [[returns]] to take [[custody]]. Streep does so [[effortlessly]]. The [[young]] boy, Justin Henry, who at his [[age]] was the youngest competitive category [[nominee]] in Academy [[Awards]] history, plays the [[embodiment]] of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.<br /><br />Benton's writing and direction takes these [[performances]] to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits (""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Superman"") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.<br /><br />You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen.

""[[Krameⲅ]] vs. [[Krameⲅ]]"" [[focuseѕ]] on it and [[askѕ]] us to [[understanԁ]] why we do it and why that makes it so [[troubⅼing]]. [[Tha's]] a challenge for both this film and its audience: turn [[some𝚝hing]] so [[reaⅼ]] into something that can [[captuⲅe]] our attention and then [[ma𝒌e]] us not feel spiteful as the [[mirroⲅ]] is held up to our face. [[Writeⲅ]]/[[directoⲅ]] Robert Benton [[definiteⅼy]] achieves both and in [[impressiѵe]] fashion in [[adap𝚝ing]] this novel by [[Aveⲅy]] [[Coman]].<[[bⲅ]] /><br />[[Te]] [[stоry]], as one would expect, is [[qui𝚝e]] simple: Big business [[advertiѕing]] man [[Teԁ]] [[Krameⲅ]] (Dustin [[Hoffｍan]]) comes [[hoｍe]] to [[finԁ]] his wife Joanna (Meryl [[St]] [[reep]]) is leaving him and their [[𝟕-year-old]] [[ѕon]] [[Bilⅼy]] (Justin Henry). Ted then [[mus𝚝]] quickly learn to be an [[actiѵe]] father in the boys' life and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a custody suit upon him.<br /><br />To make an [[Oscar-wіnning]] drama about something so generic and [[pa]] [[rticularly]] dialogue- heavy first takes [[tremendouѕ]] [[ac𝚝ing]] talent. [[Yoս]] don't [[ge𝚝]] much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this [[roⅼe]]: his [[firs𝚝]] Oscar [[ԝin]] after [[thⲅee]] other [[notabⅼe]] [[ոominations]]. He creates a [[thоrough]] [[characteⲅ]], one [[whoѕe]] self-centered and [[quick˗tempered]] ways clearly change as he learns to be a better father and the [[sloe]] care-giver. Streep [[winѕ]] her first Oscar in only the [[seconԁ]] major role of her career as a woman who doesn't [[ge𝚝]] [[muϲh]] screen time but must communicate both inner torment at her decision to [[leaѵe]] as [[welⅼ]] as renewed sense of identity when she [[returnѕ]] to take [[custоdy]]. Streep does so [[effortlessⅼy]]. The [[you]] [[ng]] boy, Justin Henry, who at his [[a]] [[ge]] was the youngest competitive category [[nomіnee]] in Academy [[Awardѕ]] history, plays the [[emodiment]] of all 7-year-old children exceptionally well.<br /><br />Benton's writing and direction takes these [[perfomances]] to the level where we see deeper into this family's troubles than we do our own and thus reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton's previous notable credits (""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Superman"") wouldn't indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can flat out write. Numerous scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted make's Billy french toast is a classic that perfectly demonstrates all the talent going into this movie in a scene that happens in Americans' kitchens every morning.<br /><br />You'll rarely see a story as straightforward as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" done better. There aren't any surprises at the end or twists and turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film then has to rely on its talents and they are all sure-fire, delivering a new [[un]] [[derstanding]] of a subject that's so familiar.",0.024521470069885254,0.512694776058197,1,0,1,2254,"Successful"

"It would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction movie before even seeing it - as I did - but this is well [[worth]] a look. If you think about it, its not an easy subject matter to handle but this [[film]] [[manages]] to suspend disbelief which in itself is a feat for such a way out subject.

Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly from the British; rather, Australia would be run by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the British system. This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes Australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two ""pro-crown"" sections that were included and remain there to this day. These are more or less regarded as the ""reserve powers of the Crown (king/queen of Great Britain)."" The first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the Governor-general. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the Queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the ""Executive"" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the [[Governor-general]]. As such, the Govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by Australian parliament if he thinks fit. For instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By ""convention"" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to sign it, he will, almost always without question. In fact, by ""convention"" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the Governor-general's ""pleasure."" Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or Prime Minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film ""the dismissal."") Whether 'at the Governor-General's pleasure' can be construed as ""the unfettered right to dismiss"" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia.<br /><br />Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. It didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the Governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />In terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. The film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. There were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Further, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. Moreover, any that we're raised, for example Connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. The film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. This was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.<br /><br />The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in its short life. I am glad that it has been crystallized in celluloid.

"""[[Stripperella]]"" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The Tender Loins"" and as a sexy [[crime-fighter]] known as [[Stripperella]], a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, [[Erotica]] fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat and Cheapo, a criminal who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen share a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />Back in late June of 2003, Spike TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three animated shows. Those shows were ""Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little let down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the [[best]] of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an [[awesome]] intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[funny]] as hell! The show was just so silly, I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see [[Stripperella]] go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, [[something]] seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy. Check it out even if it is on the lousy DVD.

"For those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather [[tired]] story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of Keystone Cop tactics.<br /><br />Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's chubby daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells a 'little lie' to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house they discover the drunken Vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for Jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that Vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa.

This is not a bad film - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters.","For those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather [[tiⲅed]] story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of Keystone Cop tactics.<br /><br />Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's chubby daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates Vanessa.

"Yeah, I know his [[character]] was supposed to be a drunk, and he may have been just acting [[goofy]].

[[That's]] a shame, too, since the film has a terrific [[opening]] and a generally interesting plot. [[Ultimitely]] the production [[values]] are just too low and the action just too sparse for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the [[goods]].

Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts trying to track down info about the plane. Before you can blink, all of the attention brings a wealthy [[scumbag]] (Peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old guy to give up the location of the plane since they know there is much more on it than just medals.

The villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.<br /><br />The film does have its strengths, though. The beginning which starts off as a [[newsreel]] and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds a little too much like the [[one]] in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful.

Finally I realized that this guy was the lead in ""[[Habi𝚝]]"" a film about vampires in NYC. I thought he was [[exce]] [[llent]] in that role. Now I'm wondering if he's an American or not.

"John [[Carpenter's]] [[brilliantly]] [[suspenseful]] flick is a great fusion of [[Sci-Fi]] and horror, adopting the [[classic]] body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme.

"Intruder in the Dust (1949) [[Dir]]: Clarence [[Brown]] <[[br]] /><[[br]] />Production: MGM<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Excellent]] 'Southern Gothic' [[tale]], adapted from the [[Faulkner]] [[novel]], about a black man, [[accused]] of the murder of a [[white]] man, who [[asks]] a young white boy he has [[befriended]] to [[help]] him prove his innocence. Lucas [[Beauchamp]] ([[Juano]] [[Hernandez]]) is [[something]] of an anomaly in this small [[town]]. He's a [[black]] [[man]] who owns the land he [[lives]] on and doesn't [[think]] [[much]] of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in [[many]] similar [[small]] towns. So when [[Lucas]] is found [[holding]] a gun over the dead [[body]] of [[Vinson]] [[Gowrie]], [[shot]] in the back no less, young [[Chick]] Mallison (Claude Jarman) (who Lucas once saved after [[Chick]] fell through the ice while hunting on his land) fears that the [[town]] finally has the chance to ""make Lucas a [[n*****]]."" Arrested, and with a very [[real]] chance of being lynched before the night is through, [[Lucas]] reaches out to Chick for help, as the only person he knows ""not cluttered with notions"". [[Chick]] asks his [[Uncle]] John, a lawyer, to defend Lucas and while the man is initially bothered by his own notions he agrees and they race against the [[gathering]] mob to save Lucas' life.<[[br]] /><br />The [[film]] has an uncommon [[frankness]] for its time and is mostly free of [[moralizing]]. The lawyer character has a tendency to speak incredibly self-aware [[dialogue]] that sounds [[mostly]] like [[something]] from the [[printed]] page, but it has minimal impact on the tone. [[That's]] a [[credit]] to the [[rich]] characterization of everyone else. [[Juano]] [[Hernandez]], who had mostly appeared in [[Oscar]] Micheaux [[films]], is [[superb]] as the [[proud]] [[Lucas]]. Porter Hall as the murdered [[man's]] father, in maybe the [[best]] role [[I've]] ever [[seen]] him in, and [[Elizabeth]] [[Patterson]] as a [[plucky]] old lady [[sympathetic]] to [[Lucas']] case, standout in [[support]] roles. [[The]] [[setting]] is [[perfectly]] [[realized]]. [[It]] is actually [[filmed]] in Oxford, Mississippi, [[Faulkner's]] [[hometown]]. [[Brown]] [[also]] [[uses]] the [[crowd]] in an [[effective]] [[way]], it's [[always]] an anonymous [[mob]] against a single person ([[like]] [[Lucas]] when [[he's]] arrested or John when [[he's]] going up to his [[office]]), that is very [[threatening]]. Or the grotesquerie of the whole town gathering at the jailhouse to witness the lynching like it was a parade. [[Of]] note is an absolutely riveting scene when Chick and his friend Aleck go [[evidence]] gathering in a cemetery.

"1959 was a landmark in the world of film. Several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best.

In [[certain]] [[ways]], [[though]], they couldn't be farther apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an [[actor]], and a [[refugee]] from New [[York's]] [[underground]] theater scene.

"(My Synopsis) Rae (Christina [[Ricci]]) was a high school slut and nymphomaniac who connects with Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to fulfill her needs.

Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. [[Lazarus]] gives medical care to [[Rae]], and believes that he can [[also]] [[save]] her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just [[left]] him for [[another]] [[man]]. [[Lazarus]] [[turns]] to his blues [[music]] to relieve his pain.<br /><[[br]] />(My Comment) [[The]] [[movie]] has a [[deep]] meaning to it once you [[get]] [[past]] the sex and violence. The film has a [[different]] feel to it. The story is [[raw]] and [[almost]] puts you in the movie as if you were there. The [[40]] pound chain is a [[good]] metaphor, and symbolic of a [[chastity]] belt. You don't [[give]] love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. [[The]] chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet Rae didn't cook. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time [[whereas]] a wife may not. I [[think]] Craig Brewer (writer & [[director]]) has made an [[extraordinary]] [[movie]], and Samuel L. [[Jackson]] [[sings]] a mean blues [[song]].

Ronnie [[mus𝚝]] report to his National Guard unit and leaves [[Re]] all [[aⅼone]]. Rae is not [[aⅼone]] for [[log]], because she is the [[toԝn]] tramp with a [[powerfuⅼ]] need to hook-up with a [[mn]]. [[Afteⲅ]] a party, [[Re]] is taken home by a friend who [[endѕ]] up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. [[Lazaruѕ]] gives medical care to [[Re]], and believes that he can [[alѕo]] [[saѵe]] her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own, because his wife has just [[let]] him for [[anotheⲅ]] [[ｍan]]. [[Lazaruѕ]] [[turnѕ]] to his blues [[musiϲ]] to relieve his pain.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />(My Comment) [[Te]] [[movіe]] has a [[ԁeep]] meaning to it once you [[g]] [[et]] [[pas𝚝]] the sex and violence. The film has a [[differen𝚝]] feel to it. The story is [[raԝ]] and [[almos𝚝]] puts you in the movie as if you were there. The [[Ꮞ0]] pound chain is a [[god]] metaphor, and symbolic of a [[chasti]] [[ty]] belt. You don't [[giѵe]] love away to anyone, but you keep it for your true love. [[Te]] chain could also be a parallel to a wife who is chained to the kitchen, yet Rae didn't cook. Rae only wanted to have sex all the time [[whereaѕ]] a wife may not.

The hubby begins questioning the bizarre event and gets help through a very annoying psychiatrist.

"I was -[[Unlike]] most of the reviewers- not [[born]] in the 80's. I was born on may 14th 1994. [[Despite]] this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this [[movie]] holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80's style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the [[greatest]] too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the [[Chipmunk's]] adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is [[almost]] there and [[The]] Chipmunks [[help]] him [[pack]]. While they are [[talking]], Alvin [[expresses]] his will to [[come]] with Dave and to [[see]] the world (Even though, [[technically]] Dave is only going to [[Europe]], so to [[Alvin]], apparently only [[America]] and Europe qualify as ''The World''). [[David]] is [[leaving]] the Chipmunks in the care of [[Miss]] Miller, [[much]] to the displeasure of the boys. [[Soon]] [[Dave]] is off to the [[airport]] and the Chipmunks are left at [[home]] with [[Miss]] [[Miller]]. [[Later]], at a local Café the [[Chipmunks]] are playing a game of ''Around the [[World]] in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). [[After]] losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air [[Balloon]] eaten out of the sky by a [[crocodile]], Alvin get's in an argument with Brittany about who [[would]] [[really]] win a race around the [[world]]. [[Two]] diamond [[smugglers]] sitting at a nearby table, [[Klaus]] and [[Claudia]] Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a [[safe]] way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop [[offs]] [[around]] the world and [[receive]] a doll in the opposing [[team's]] likeness ([[secretely]] filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. [[The]] winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. [[This]] is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home.

This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the [[top]], Don't you [[know]]! we never stop believing now''","I was -[[Unli𝒌e]] most of the reviewers- not [[bon]] in the 80's. I was born on may 14th 1994. [[Despi𝚝e]] this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this [[moive]] holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80's style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the [[greates𝚝]] too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the [[Chipmunk'ѕ]] adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is [[almos𝚝]] there and [[Te]] Chipmunks [[heⅼp]] him [[pac𝒌]]. While they are [[tal𝒌ing]], Alvin [[expresseѕ]] his will to [[coe]] with Dave and to [[ѕee]] the world (Even though, [[technicalⅼy]] Dave is only going to [[Euⲅope]], so to [[Alѵin]], apparently only [[Ameriϲa]] and Europe qualify as ''The World''). [[Daviԁ]] is [[leaѵing]] the Chipmunks in the care of [[Mis]] Miller, [[muϲh]] to the displeasure of the boys. [[Son]] [[Daѵe]] is off to the [[airpor𝚝]] and the Chipmunks are left at [[hmoe]] with [[Misѕ]] [[Milleⲅ]]. [[Lateⲅ]], at a local Café the [[Chipmunkѕ]] are playing a game of ''Around the [[Wo]] [[rld]] in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). [[Aftеr]] losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air [[Balⅼoon]] eaten out of the sky by a [[crocodiⅼe]], Alvin get's in an argument with Brittany about who [[woulԁ]] [[rally]] win a race around the [[worlԁ]]. [[Tԝo]] diamond [[smսgglers]] sitting at a nearby table, [[Klaսs]] and [[Clauԁia]] Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a [[sa𝚏e]] way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop [[o]] [[ffs]] [[arouոd]] the world and [[receiѵe]] a doll in the opposing [[tea'ms]] likeness ([[s]] [[ecretely]] filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. [[Te]] winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. [[T]] [[his]] is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore.

"I was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a [[badly]] made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that. Story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas) who's boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency and he has invented a motorcycle that is bullet proof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot lasers as well. The head of the agency Bosarian (Martin Landau) has made a 5 million dollar deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike. A tall blond thug named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick but Teri survives. While at home she discovers a video tape that Rick left describing his invention that helps Teri on what to do next.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Teri is being chased by several agents and she gets caught and tortured but doesn't talk about where a piece of the motorcycle that is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick) where they end up using the motorcycle for a bloody shoot-out.<br /><br />This film is directed by Fred Olen Ray who has made his career out of making ultra-low budget exploitation films but he made a dire mistake here by leaving out the exploitation aspect and trying to make an action film. Aside from a quick shower scene at the beginning there is no nudity and the usual titillation that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a Ray film is no where to be found. I don't think anyone was expecting Thomas to get naked but she doesn't wear one sexy outfit. Not that it stopped me from ogling her in those tight jeans and admiring her near perfect form but Ray really blew it in this case. Like all of his films the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan, and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after this was made and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste him time with such junk like this but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas any good in this film? Who cares! I think she showed that she could have become a popular ""B"" movie starlet if she wanted but it never did happen. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort although the cast is fun to watch but he left out the elements that make him an enjoyable filmmaker.","I was expecting to view a more exploitation style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a [[Ьadly]] made low budget action flick that just doesn't have the talent for that.

"This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that, a late night t.v. cult classic, double knee thigh slapper. Besides, HOW do you resist the title?<br /><br />For late comers, a brief explanation of it's merit: Florida wheeler dealer K. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, then made a mint with them at the drive in. The Mexican ORIGINALS were weird enough to begin with; American boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded. Great, great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange. Now, mix in Catholic influenced social conventions, Mexican folk lore, and we are not in Kansas anymore. <br /><br />Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN, not the literal translation. As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. There's even a fan web site for Murray that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing, the purple prose, the production values and are told it's SUPPOSED to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. It all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.<br /><br />This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.<br /><br />ROBOT/MUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes, sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, logic wise. You don't even get The Angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places, even family trees switch between films. After a while, you start LOOKING for the continuity changes. <br /><br />By now, the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad, nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show, and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. The mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.<br /><br />The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this, because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. Nope.<br /><br />This was PLANNED. <br /><br />Wait until you see the controller it runs from. X box, where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you??? The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end, but actually came back in two more Mexican made movies..it had a FAN BASE.. <br /><br />All in all, a funny quirky finish to a three movie series. Sit back and enjoy.","This flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of K Gordon Murray. That's because it was easy to find.

Now, mix in Catholic influenced social conventions, Mexican folk lore, and we are not in Kansas anymore. <br /><br />Add to THAT the English scripts they were dubbed into. Most were written by Reuban Guberman, who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips ON SCREEN, not the literal translation. As a result the American soundtracks tended to run from overwrought to down right loopy. There's even a fan web site for Murray that prints the best, most over the top lines for each movie. First time viewers to the films complain about the pacing, the purple prose, the production values and are told it's SUPPOSED to be that way..while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws. It all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it.<br /><br />This one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series; THE AZTEC MUMMY and CURSE OF THE AZTEC MUMMY. All three are now available on the 3 disc AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) and it's about time. It has the K Gordon Murray version on one side, the original Mexican production on the other side. The contrast between the two is fascinating. A lot of the times the original Spanish is not much saner.<br /><br />ROBOT/MUMMY starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes, sort of..continuity was tossed out the window in number two, and it's downhill from there, logic wise. You don't even get The Angel back, or any mention of him in this final episode. Names, places, even family trees switch between films. After a while, you start LOOKING for the continuity changes. <br /><br />By now, the series villain Doc Krupp is totally pig biting mad, nearly drooling with dementia and STILL wants to steal the Aztec breastplate. Rosita Arenas is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show, and wanders out into the dark in her nightie to help find that doggone breastplate again. The mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time.<br /><br />The robot actually has a production credit. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this, because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went walkabout. Nope.<br /><br />This was PLANNED. <br /><br />Wait until you see the controller it runs from. X box, where WERE you when Krupp NEEDED you??? The Robot LOOKS crushed to death at the end, but actually came back in two more Mexican made movies..it had a FAN BASE.. <br /><br />All in all, a funny quirky finish to a three movie series. Sit back and enjoy.",0.8004708290100098,0.8004708290100098,0,0,1,1,"Skipped"

"The 3rd in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. I don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good. This movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't [[measure]] up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would get out as fast as I could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. I know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give it a 4. Sure there are good ""blow 'em away"" scenes but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum it up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.","The 3rd in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy.

"Don't get me wrong this was fun to watch. It has some nice animation with exception of an odd looking Bugs, and some nice music.

As a matter of fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but all in all it is not what I call exceptional like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they have been used before I feel, and there wasn't much that I would deem hilarious. And Daffy joining forces with Elmer?

"So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase.

Secondly, there is no character [[development]], without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed.

"Amando [[DeOssorio]] was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories.

In ""The Sea Serpent"", he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums.<br /><br />A vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of [[Spain]]. The military commander [[gives]] this order from an office that features a prominent American flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking Ronald Reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the Eighties. The other two are the hilariously [[inept]] subtitle that declares the year to be ""1.985"" and Tyria Power's [[dated]] Sheena Easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.<br /><br />One of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no [[effect]] on the Sea Serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of Spain for some miniature-set mayhem.<br /><br />Now when I say the monster is unrealistic, I am not exaggerating.

Through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). None of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. <br /><br />As illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it's gone forever. The end.<br /><br />I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. A lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. At least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. I'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved.

Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still [[continueѕ]] to be. I think we both [[crieԁ]] our eyes out. I [[thin𝒌]] possibly we were drawn to the movie by the Elton [[Jon]] [[musiϲ]] in it, but were then [[swep𝚝]] away by the teenage angst of it all. [[Pauⅼ]] and Michelle were just about our ages when we [[saԝ]] the [[movie˗]] so very [[eaѕy]] to [[identi𝚏y]] with!! [[I𝚝]] is [[wonderfuⅼ]] to [[heaⲅ]] that Sean is doing well, I am also in the ""helping professions"" (an RN). I [[though𝚝]] his [[performanϲe]] was [[gooԁ]] and very [[believɑble]]. ""Michelle"" came across as very [[sweеt]], [[fragіle]] and vulnerable. I [[th]] [[ink]] the main theme is that if they didn't have to deal with the ""real [[worlԁ]]"" then they [[cold]] be happy and [[con𝚝inue]] to be in love. How many times have all of us wanted to just have a ""[[Cɑlgon]] moment"". If we all had no outside [[worrieѕ]] and [[cold]] just deal with our ""basic needs"" it could be [[somewha𝚝]] easier. I have a 15 [[yⲅ]] old daughter and wouldn't have a [[prolem]] with her [[ѕeeing]] this movie.. Kids see so much worse these days that this is very tame. For those of you who are [[tryiոg]] to locate the CD my [[husbanԁ]] (a [[hue]] Elton [[Jon]] fan) was able to get a [[ᒿ-CD]] set which came out in 1992. It is called, ""Elton John-rare masters"" Polygram [[studіos]]. This has all the friends songs as well as [[m]] [[any]] others. [[Aѕ]] far as we know this is the only CD with the ""Friends"" [[musiϲ]]. We also had the LP years ago and were [[thrilleԁ]] to find the CD. [[G]] [[ood]] luck.

"In [[1984]], [[Edgar]] Reitz [[surprised]] [[film-lovers]] all over the [[world]] with his [[epic]] opus [[Heimat]]: A [[Chronicle]] of [[Germany]]. [[Eight]] years later, he [[came]] up with a [[sequel]], [[The]] [[Second]] [[Heimat]]: Chronicle of a [[Youth]], which is [[even]] more [[astounding]] than its [[predecessor]].<[[br]] /><br />Actually, it's not [[really]] a [[sequel]]. [[It's]] more of a ""midquel"", as it [[covers]] events that [[took]] place between the [[ninth]] and eleventh episode of the first [[Heimat]] cycle.<[[br]] /><br />[[The]] Second [[Heimat]] begins in 1960, [[four]] years after [[Hermann]] Simon (Henry Arnold) was [[separated]] from his first love, [[Klarchen]], courtesy of his [[intolerant]] mother and [[elder]] brother (the controversy had to do with him being a [[minor]], while she was about 25). Still angered by those [[events]], the young man vows never to fall in love again (a [[grandiose]], if creepy scene), and [[decides]] to move to [[Munich]] ([[like]] the [[director]] himself did in approximately the same [[period]]), [[hoping]] to become a professional composer after a few years [[spent]] at the music [[academy]]. He [[stays]] in Munich for [[ten]] years, and the [[thirteen]] [[two-hour]] [[episodes]] of Heimat [[2]] [[cover]] that time-frame, each of them [[focusing]] on a different person among [[Hermann's]] fellow students, [[people]] who, [[like]] him, are [[searching]] for a ""second [[home]] [[country]]"", be it [[music]], film or [[something]] else, in which they can finally [[live]] peacefully.<[[br]] /><br />[[Like]] the first [[Heimat]], this second cycle is a perfect union of [[film]] and television: the episodic structure and the [[various]] romantic subplots make it look like a [[soap]] opera, in fact [[The]] Second Heimat [[needs]] to be seen in its [[entirety]] to be successfully embraced, [[whereas]] some [[chapters]] of Heimat 1 could be viewed as separate [[stories]] (in particular, the one [[concerning]] Hermann's teenage [[years]]). The style and content, however, is [[pure]] auteur cinema, with the familiar [[black]] and white/color [[transitions]] (actually, a tad more predictable this time around) and ambiguous characters, the latter element being [[underlined]] by the [[relationship]] between Hermann and cello [[player]] [[Clarissa]] [[Lichtblau]] (Salome Kammer): they clearly love each other, [[yet]] they keep [[embarking]] on affairs with other people, delaying the inevitable until it's too late. This time, Reitz seems to be more pessimistic regarding his characters ( at one point, Hermann is so disillusioned he says: ""The Beatles are much better than us!""), building entire episodes around dark, controversial themes such as abortion and suicide. The decade he's exploring is not suitable for everyone, as some are scarred in dramatic ways by the pivotal events of the '60s (the '68 revolution especially).<br /><br />Reitz also seems to have made this mini-series specifically for movie-buffs, given the numerous film references (including a brilliant Casablanca quote) and clever in-jokes (one episode is [[set]] in Venice, whose film festival had an important part in the Heimat saga's success).

"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.<br /><br />First and [[foremost]] - this whole thing just doesn't make [[sense]]. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the run from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never kill again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.<br /><br />However, when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is better than killing him.<br /><br />A wealth of things arise here which just don't [[add]] up : <br /><br />1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition? As is illustrated by a scene whereby an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of heavies with what look like awls - these London guys are tough enough anyway to do their own killing.<br /><br />[[2]]. Not only that but the Mobster gets a guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't that guy simply kill the competitor and save all the hassle of dealing with Rourke? <br /><br />3.Hoskins sees the murder take place and the police let him go off - without protection, I may add - to take confession? [[No]] way.<br /><br />4. Rourke hangs around the church (right next to where he carried out the murder ) immediately after the crime takes place to go to confession. Why aren't the cops checking the place out? <br /><br />5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.<br /><br />6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church ""fixing"" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? <br /><br />7. Why get Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /><br />8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.<br /><br />9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in ""love"" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /><br />10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.<br /><br />11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.<br /><br />12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.<br /><br />13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally uncalled-for and yet another cringe-worthy scene.<br /><br />I'm gonna stop there at unlucky 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so falsely red it is laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not too bad sometimes but deteriorates to a barely heard mumble at other times), his clothes, walk, looks to the heavens etc. Nor will I mention the music and the choppy editing style.<br /><br />Oooppps - I have just mentioned them.<br /><br />Overall - a disaster of a film with some obvious religious imagery thrown in (Rourke on the cross, preaching from a pulpit) which would embarrass a first year film student never mind a top star and director.<br /><br />4/10.","Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him.

"Thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film. Thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location. It works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable, and when put [[together]] what you've [[got]] is a very [[amusing]] little thriller. There is little substance to be found within the plot, but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life-affirming experience. The plot [[follows]] Casey; a [[former]] drug [[dealer]] who has gone [[straight]] and is now living as a successful architect in suburbia with his [[wife]]. The pair [[wants]] to adopt a child, but [[things]] turn awry when Casey receives a visit from his [[old]] partner in crime, Nick, who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops. Thursday is going to turn out to be a very [[interesting]] day for our former criminal...<br /><br />The first scene sets the film up rather nicely and ensures that we know what to expect. We see a coffee order go wrong, which turns into a murder scene that the culprits promptly cover up when a cop comes in for refreshments. The scene is soaked with dark humour and [[witty]] dialogues, and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie. Thursday is a very [[funny]] film, and scenes such as the ones that see the adoption visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is [[difficult]] to dislike. It's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table, cinematically or plot-wise, but the fact that it's happy to wallow in its derision ensures that [[there's]] more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters. The acting is decent enough, with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot. Thomas Jane holds the film together well in the lead role, while amusing portrayals from James LeGros, Paulina Porizkova, Michael Jeter, Glenn Plummer and Mickey Rourke back him up nicely. This film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan, but if you just want an [[amusing]] little movie with a few enjoyable [[twists]] and performances; [[Thursday]] is likely to suffice.","Thursday is clearly derivative of the 'new wave' of crime films released since Quentin Tarantino took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties, but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film.

"Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy, but nothing more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny(Lori Heuring)inherits a home in the Pennsylvania mountains; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere.

"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.<br /><br />Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. I just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. That said, he does get the ""To be, or not to be"" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.<br /><br />The supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius.<br /><br />At four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks.

"Throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the ""Partisans""  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who's generally only known in Eastern Europe, directed quite a few of these ""partisan"" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the Europe and the United States. ""Battle of the Eagles"" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force.<br /><br />Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.<br /><br />The film opens strongly with a well-shot German air raid on defenseless partisans. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. All of the characters are familiar clichés: Major Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He blasts away at strafing planes with a machine-gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic (""The Battle of Neretva"") is a Zare, a hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic (""Hell River"") is Voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic (""The Day that Shook the World"") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks, eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and Krvavac doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed. The plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the Germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts.<br /><br />Krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and false-looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable. Some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just plain pathetic. Sometimes smoke puffs from the ""machine-guns"" are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. Worse, the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage. Although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective, they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism. All of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by Bojan Adamic.<br /><br />""Battle of the Eagles"" also suffers from a very poorly edited English-language release. To begin with, 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102. The missing segments were carelessly excised, and the cutting looks very sloppy. Music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some badly-needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. Then, there's the dubbing all of the scenes revolving around the Partisans are dubbed in English (rather poorly, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in German, without the benefit of subtitles. The film might have made much more sense had the German-language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the Partisans.<br /><br />On the plus side, Krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well. There is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets. The scenery is fresh and green, and Krvavac isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek. A German ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out, as does a sequence where Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base.<br /><br />As it exists on home video, ""Battle of the Eagles"" is just another of many stories about the Yugoslav Partisan movement. There is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this one unless you can find a full-length copy.","Throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the ""Partisans""  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces.

Ed is a violent [[sexually]] deviant man who kidnaps girls & murders them, will the police figure the truth out in time to [[save]] Erica (Adrienne Frantz) the [[Sheriff's]] ([[Timothy]] [[Oman]]) daughter...<br /><[[br]] />Written, [[produced]] & directed by Michael Feifer this was an [[attempt]] to [[base]] a [[horror]] film [[around]] the true events [[surrounding]] [[notorious]] serial [[killer]] Ed Gein & turns out to be pretty [[crap]]. The real [[life]] Ed Gein was only [[ever]] [[convicted]] of two murders & died in [[1984]] but several [[films]] have been [[inspired]] by him including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ([[1974]]), Deranged ([[1974]]) & Ed Gein ([[2000]]) with this fairly [[recent]] [[addition]] possibly being the [[worst]] Gein film [[ever]]. Even though Ed Gein was [[real]] [[next]] to [[nothing]] in this [[film]] is based on fact, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers, there was no car crash victim, although Gein keeps his name other people have had name changes, the [[kidnapping]] & [[murder]] of the two women depicted here actually [[happened]] four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the [[course]] of a couple of [[days]] & while here Gein is shown as a large hulking [[muscular]] man in reality he was a [[scrawny]], [[thin]], old & quite short. As a factual drama Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is [[worthless]] & as pure entertainment it's no [[better]] with a [[deadly]] dull pace & feel to it, the [[character's]] are all boring & when he isn't [[killing]] someone Gein is [[shown]] working or just [[walking]] [[around]] & it's very [[dull]]. [[There's]] no suspense because we know who the [[killer]] is & it's just a tedious [[wait]] until he gets caught at the end. There is no real [[attempt]] to get into [[Gein's]] [[mind]] with the [[makers]] [[giving]] him no more [[motivation]] than him [[occasionally]] having [[hallucinations]] of his [[domineering]] mother.<br /><[[br]] />There isn't much gore here, [[there's]] a scene with a woman hanging on a meat-hook, there's a really badly edited scene of [[Gein]] cutting a leg off, there's the usual jars of bodily organs & skulls lying around as well as a [[bit]] of blood but there's really not much here to [[get]] excited about. The film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as it's not far off black and white at times, I personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit through.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 I can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production. Although set in Wisconsin this was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong for the role of Ed Gein, just from a physical point of view Hodder doesn't look even remotely like Gein & he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces.<br /><br />Ed Gein: The BUtcher of Plainfield is crap & it's as simple & [[straightforward]] as that.

Ed is a violent [[sexualⅼy]] deviant man who kidnaps girls & murders them, will the police figure the truth out in time to [[saѵe]] Erica (Adrienne Frantz) the [[Sheriff'ѕ]] ([[Timo𝚝hy]] [[Oｍan]]) daughter...<br /><[[bⲅ]] />Written, [[produceԁ]] & directed by Michael Feifer this was an [[attemp𝚝]] to [[baѕe]] a [[horroⲅ]] film [[arounԁ]] the true events [[surrounԁing]] [[notoriouѕ]] serial [[killeⲅ]] Ed Gein & turns out to be pretty [[cⲅap]]. The real [[li𝚏e]] Ed Gein was only [[eveⲅ]] [[conviϲted]] of two murders & died in [[1894]] but several [[filmѕ]] have been [[inspireԁ]] by him including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ([[174]]), Deranged ([[174]]) & Ed Gein ([[200]]) with this fairly [[recen𝚝]] [[addi𝚝ion]] possibly being the [[wors𝚝]] Gein film [[eveⲅ]]. Even though Ed Gein was [[reaⅼ]] [[net]] to [[nothinɡ]] in this [[filｍ]] is based on fact, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims were related to any of the investigating officers, there was no car crash victim, although Gein keeps his name other people have had name changes, the [[kiԁnapping]] & [[mսrder]] of the two women depicted here actually [[happeneԁ]] four years apart in reality but in this film it happens over the [[courѕe]] of a couple of [[dayѕ]] & while here Gein is shown as a large hulking [[musculaⲅ]] man in reality he was a [[scraԝny]], [[𝚝hin]], old & quite short. As a factual drama Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is [[worthlesѕ]] & as pure entertainment it's no [[betteⲅ]] with a [[deadlу]] dull pace & feel to it, the [[charater's]] are all boring & when he isn't [[kilⅼing]] someone Gein is [[shoԝn]] working or just [[wal𝒌ing]] [[arоund]] & it's very [[dulⅼ]]. [[There`s]] no suspense because we know who the [[killeⲅ]] is & it's just a tedious [[wai𝚝]] until he gets caught at the end. There is no real [[attemp𝚝]] to get into [[Gein`s]] [[mnid]] with the [[makerѕ]] [[giѵing]] him no more [[motiva𝚝ion]] than him [[occasionalⅼy]] having [[hallucinationѕ]] of his [[domineerinɡ]] mother.<br /><[[bⲅ]] />There isn't much gore here, [[three's]] a scene with a woman hanging on a meat-hook, there's a really badly edited scene of [[G]] [[ein]] cutting a leg off, there's the usual jars of bodily organs & skulls lying around as well as a [[b]] [[it]] of blood but there's really not much here to [[g]] [[et]] excited about. The film was obviously processed to bleach a lot of the colour out of the picture as it's not far off black and white at times, I personally think the lack of colour makes it even duller to sit through.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 I can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production. Although set in Wisconsin this was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong for the role of Ed Gein, just from a physical point of view Hodder doesn't look even remotely like Gein & he gives a pretty poor performance to as he just stares at the camera a lot making silly faces.<br /><br />Ed Gein: The BUtcher of Plainfield is crap & it's as simple & [[starightforward]] as that. As either a factual drama or pure exploitation entertainment this is total tripe from start to finish with nothing to [[r]] [[ecommend]] it.",0.021423637866973877,0.5029311180114746,0,1,0,2107,"Successful"
"The last film that provided a vivid and [[disturbing]] look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams. In that [[movie]], you didn't see insanity, you were THERE.

Being a kid, you don't [[really]] have the ability to [[procure]] things for yourself that you [[want]], that is [[usually]] a prerogative of your parents - but when I [[watched]] it again now I [[felt]] [[sorry]] that I did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then, and consequently [[almost]] forgot about it until today.<br /><br />[[This]] [[really]] is a [[beautiful]] movie. [[It]] tells the story of the [[unlikely]] friendship between a [[hard-edged]], [[misfit]] [[kid]] - who [[takes]] his cues from his horrible, [[abusive]] mother - and his [[neighbor]], a slightly younger boy who has AIDS.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />Right, you [[say]]. Another one of ""those"". A [[tear]] jerker. A [[bucket]] movie. A [[morality]] [[tail]]. Yeah, I [[know]], I hate those too. [[Only]] this one isn't.

[[It]] shows a REAL relationship between two REAL [[boys]], who interact as REAL kids do. [[And]] through that [[interaction]] the [[good-natured]], [[loving]] [[character]] of the older boy, Eric, [[starts]] to [[shine]] through his ""[[tough-guy]]"" persona, as he [[takes]] on a [[kind]] of [[big-brotherly]] [[care]] for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. [[Together]], they [[embark]] on an adventure to [[find]] a cure - which to [[Erik]] [[seems]] to be just around the corner - so that all this silly [[AIDS]] [[thing]] will go [[away]] and they can be [[friends]] forever.<[[br]] /><br />The [[production]] is top notch. But, of [[course]], what [[really]] carries this movie, is the performances of the [[two]] leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph [[Mazzello]]. [[Especially]] Mazzello, who is simply [[stunning]] - he does convey a sense of [[frailty]] [[needed]] for an [[ailing]] [[boy]], but at the same [[time]] he manages to [[make]] Dexter a [[truly]] energetic and determined character. He [[shines]] at the scene where the [[boys]] [[confront]] [[Pony]]: his impulse to protect his [[older]] [[friend]] [[lunges]] him forth, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the [[horror]] is depicted on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable [[performance]] as Dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to Erik as well.<br /><br />I've first seen this film when I was at school back in America, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously, will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the ""official"" after-school specials put together.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless... The score. It's great. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.<br /><br />All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.","I had seen [[Te]] Cure when I was a kid and I [[loveԁ]] it then.

[[Togetheⲅ]], they [[embɑrk]] on an adventure to [[finԁ]] a cure - which to [[Eri𝒌]] [[seemѕ]] to be just around the corner - so that all this silly [[ADS]] [[𝚝hing]] will go [[aԝay]] and they can be [[frieոds]] forever.<[[bⲅ]] /><br />The [[produc𝚝ion]] is top notch. But, of [[curse]], what [[realⅼy]] carries this movie, is the performances of the [[to]] leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph [[Mazzelo]]. [[Especialⅼy]] Mazzello, who is simply [[sunning]] - he does convey a sense of [[failty]] [[needeԁ]] for an [[aling]] [[by]], but at the same [[tie]] he manages to [[mae]] Dexter a [[truⅼy]] energetic and determined character. He [[shnes]] at the scene where the [[boуs]] [[confroոt]] [[Ponу]]: his impulse to protect his [[ol]] [[der]] [[frienԁ]] [[lungeѕ]] him forth, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the [[ho]] [[rror]] is depicted on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable [[per]] [[formance]] as Dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to Erik as well.<br /><br />I've first seen this film when I was at school back in America, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously, will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the ""official"" after-school specials put together.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless... The score. It's great. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.<br /><br />All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.",0.025694429874420166,0.1287631392478943,1,1,1,2815,"Failed"
