"[[Our]] [[Boys]] was a boys' [[magazine]] published monthly by the Irish Christian Brothers in Ireland. The various Education Acts of the late 19th and early 20th century had created a market in Britain for magazines and periodicals which were also popular in Ireland. At a time when there was a growing sense of national self-identity in Ireland, the purpose of the Our Boys magazine was to compete with British boys' magazines, which were in the main pro-British Empire and pro-Church of England. It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. It was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie. Gerrit Van Gelderen provided articles on wildlife. William Hickey wrote the \""[[Murphy]]\"" [[series]] of [[school]] [[stories]]. Another [[contributor]] was novelist [[Una]] [[Troy]].

The various Education Acts of the late 19th and early 20th century had created a market in Britain for magazines and periodicals which were also popular in Ireland.

It specialised in adventure stories, school stories and historical stories featuring Irish protagonists, competitions and puzzles, as well as lightweight family content. It was sold through the Christian Brothers' schools, as well as being available in newsagents throughout the country. A highlight of the magazine from 1924 on was the series of \""Kitty the Hare\"" stories by Victor O'D. Power. School articles were contributed by Paddy Crosbie.

[[After]] [[winning]] the European [[Junior]] [[Championship]] in 1973, he [[became]] an International [[Master]] the same [[year]]. [[In]] 1974 he was a [[member]] of the [[victorious]] [[USSR]] [[team]] at the [[World]] [[Student]] [[Team]] [[Championship]] [[held]] in Teesside, [[England]], where he scored the [[best]] [[result]] for [[board]] 4 (8/9). The [[following]] [[year]], he [[had]] a [[terrific]] [[result]] at the USSR [[Championship]], [[sharing]] [[second]] [[place]] with Boris Gulko, Mikhail [[Tal]] and [[Rafael]] Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster [[title]] was [[ratified]]. [[He]] [[has]] an [[impressive]] [[collection]] of [[tournament]] [[victories]] [[including]] Odessa 1974, Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan 1976, [[Hastings]] 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Jurmala 1983, [[Moscow]] 1985, Reggio [[Emilia]] 1986 ([[shared]] with [[Andersson]] and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. [[Playing]] the Hungarian [[Open]] [[Championship]] at Györ in 1990 he [[enjoyed]] a most [[impressive]] [[victory]], [[finishing]] a [[clear]] 2 [[points]] [[ahead]] of the [[field]]. [[Second]] [[place]] [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after [[Karpov]]) and [[Dortmund]] 1982 (after Hort) were also [[important]] [[landmarks]] in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= [[finish]] at Sochi in 1982. [[Nowadays]] [[less]] [[active]] as a [[tournament]] [[player]], he [[has]] nevertheless [[maintained]] a [[highly]] [[competitive]] [[rating]] and is [[able]] to [[win]] [[smaller]] [[events]] on the grandmaster [[circuit]], such as Solin-Split 2004 and [[Hotel]] [[Petra]] ([[Rome]]) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he [[represented]] the Soviet [[Union]] in 1978 and thereafter [[played]] for [[Ukraine]] through the 1990s, [[winning]] a [[total]] of 2 [[silver]] [[medals]] and 2 [[bronze]]. [[At]] the [[European]] [[Team]] Chess [[Championships]] his [[medal]] [[haul]] [[has]] [[amounted]] to an [[incredible]] 6 gold and 1 [[silver]]. [[His]] [[chess]] [[playing]] [[style]] [[has]] been [[described]] as [[aggressive]] and this may [[be]] a [[result]] of the [[coaching]] he [[received]] as a [[junior]]. [[Along]] with a [[group]] of other [[aspiring]] [[masters]], he was first [[coached]] by [[Viktor]] [[Kart]] (an [[instructor]] of the Lviv [[Sports]] [[Academy]]) and then, as an improver, was [[assigned]] a [[senior]] [[master]] as a [[tutor]]/[[mentor]]. [[In]] his [[case]] the [[master]] was [[Mikhail]] Tal, an ex-world [[champion]] [[noted]] for his [[attacking]] [[chess]]. [[In]] [[respect]] of [[chess]] [[opening]] [[theory]], he [[has]] a [[reputation]] for the [[use]] of [[rare]], offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded [[systems]]. [[Only]] by [[means]] of deep [[research]] and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One [[example]] is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular [[variations]] arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[Aleksandr]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[birthed]] 10 [[Feb]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Armenian]] [[shortcoming]] [[sifu]] and former European [[teenager]] [[vindicator]].

In 2004, Streisand's version on the soundtrack of Funny Girl finished at #13 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. It has been covered by Billy Eckstine, Dionne Warwick, Steve Lawrence, Jack Jones, Aretha Franklin, Nat King Cole, Wes Montgomery, Perry Como, The Supremes and others, but is considered Streisand's signature song. The song asserts that \""people who need people\"" — that is, people who love others and are not emotionally cut off from them — are the \""luckiest people in the world\"". It was released as a single with \""I Am Woman\"", a solo version of \""You Are Woman, I Am Man\"", also from Funny Girl. Andy Williams released a version of the song on his 1964 album, The Great Songs from \""My Fair Lady\"" and Other Broadway Hits.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league. The team finished the 1978–79 season with a record of 11 wins and 23 losses, placing them in fourth and last place in the Midwest Division. In the Midwestern Division for the 1979–80 season, the Does finished with a record of 11 wins and 24 losses.

Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","The Milwaukee Does were a [[accoutrements]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league. The team finished the 1978–79 season with a record of 11 wins and 23 losses, placing them in fourth and last place in the Midwest Division.
