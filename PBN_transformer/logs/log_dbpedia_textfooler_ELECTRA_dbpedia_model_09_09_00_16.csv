"Russells Hall Hospital is an NHS general [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first [[phases]] of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

It was originally developed as a NASA satellite proposed in 1998 by then-Vice President Al Gore for the purpose of Earth observation. It is in a Lissajous orbit at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point, 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth, to monitor variable solar wind condition, provide early warning of approaching coronal mass ejections and observe phenomena on Earth including changes in ozone, [[aerosols]], dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, vegetation cover and climate. At this location it has a continuous view of the Sun and the sunlit side of the Earth. The satellite is orbiting the Sun-Earth L1 point in a six-month period, with a spacecraft-Earth-Sun angle varying from 4 to 15 degrees.

"The Nedbank [[Golf]] [[Challenge]], [[previously]] [[known]] as the Million [[Dollar]] Challenge, is an [[annual]] men's [[professional]] [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the [[Gary]] Player Country Club in [[Sun]] City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the major [[tours]], but it became an [[official]] tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players.

They were signed to Smallman Records and in late-2006 released their debut album [[Stallone]]. They continued to tour and in March 2007, released their second album Turf Wars. The band consisted of Nick Leadlay (vocals, formerly of the band Playboy Assassin), Kenny Lush (guitar, formerly of The Retreads), [[Stuart]] McKillop (guitar and vocals, formerly of End This Week With Knives), Erik Nielsen (bass), and [[Dan]] Donald (drums). The band's sound is characterized by melodic vocals combined with pop-punk guitar riffs and basslines but with a more hardcore feel. Their name is a reference to a robotic fish from the Family Guy episode \""A Fish Out of Water\"". Past members include drummer J.J. Heath and bass player Dana W.R. Edwards who now play in Vancouver's \""Carpenter\"". J.J. is also punk legends DOA's new drummer. Jarrod Mochenross and Tom Hillifer also filled in on bass at certain points in time. In November 2008, Leadlay officially announced their indefinite hiatus via a Myspace blog: \""Is dmouth over? yes and no..... yes in the sense right now we aren't playing shows/touring. we may not tour for a long time if ever again to be honest. will we ever play a show again? i don't [[know]]. the more time that passes the more i hope we do. i really would love to roll out to LA and SF and play some [[shows]] like the old days. Hell lets bring it back to where we started and get Heads Up to play a back yard show with us in Pomona!!! at this point it's hard to tell. The one thing that is a definite possibuilty though is making a new record. I know that may not be enough for some of you and i understand that. But at this point for heath reasons for myself as well as some of the other members of dmouth it may be all we can offer. I miss making music and that's why we all start bands anyway is to make songs we are stoked on.\"" [sic] The band says there is an album's worth of material demoed. Stu has since been involved in a number of projects and continues to record bands. Dan has also continued playing in other bands and is currently drumming for Winnipeg, MB based pop punk band, Elder Abuse. Kenny has become a professional wrestler and has toured Japan and Korea numerous times competing. Nick Leadlay has gone on to work as a fashion photographer and a successful creative retoucher based out of Toronto, ON and N.Y.C. He has retouched images of celebrities including Robert De Niro, Jessica Chastain and Jennifer Lawrence.","Daggermouth was a Canadian pop punk/melodic hardcore [[tape]] formed in 2004 in Vancouver.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) is a top-tier administrative body for Greater London, England. It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax.

It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax.

He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998–99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard Trajan Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily-favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team. After graduation, Moore played professionally in the United States, Austria, Ukraine, Sweden, Turkey, and Germany over eleven seasons.

Moore (born April 10, 1976) is a [[withdrew]] American basketball player and current coach. He is currently an assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He played professionally for eleven years. Moore came to UConn after an All-American high school career at Westside High School in Augusta, Georgia. He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998–99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard Trajan Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily-favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[meteorites]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss.

"The [[Darshan]] [[Museum]] is a museum in Pune, India, dedicated to the noted Sindhi Saint and scholar, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani. It is a biographical museum that offers an insight into the life and therefore the teachings of Sadhu Vaswani. The museum is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the Sadhu Vaswani Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings – in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, holographic screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011.

"Canaiolo (also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine [[grape]] grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany. Other regions with plantings of Canaiolo [[include]] Lazio, Marche and Sardegna. In Umbria a white berried mutation known as Canaiolo bianco exist. Together with Sangiovese and Colorino it is often used to create Chianti wine and is an important but secondary component of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor.

In recent years plantings have been declining.","Canaiolo (also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine [[vineyard]] grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany. Other regions with plantings of Canaiolo [[therein]] Lazio, Marche and Sardegna. In Umbria a white berried mutation known as Canaiolo bianco exist. Together with Sangiovese and Colorino it is often used to create Chianti wine and is an important but secondary component of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares).

"Fyodor Savelyevich Kon (Russian: Фёдор Саве́льевич Ко́нь; fl. 1585–1600) was a 16th-century Russian military engineer and architect, the builder of Smolensk Kremlin (1597–1602) and the Bely Gorod fortification ring of Moscow (1585–1593).

"The Jerusalem Light Rail (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail system in Jerusalem. Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest.
