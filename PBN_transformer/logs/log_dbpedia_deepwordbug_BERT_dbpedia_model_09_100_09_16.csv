"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and [[referee]] Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"Augustus George Hazard (April 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was [[born]] in Kingston, Rhode Island on April 28, 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was supplying the Union Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a day. The mill at Hazardville was in operation 24 hours a day and produced 40% of all the gunpowder used during the Civil War by the Union.

"James Edwin Campbell (July 7, 1843 – December 18, [[1924]]) was a Democratic politician from Ohio. He served as the 38th Governor of Ohio.

He was a master's mate on the [[gunboats]] Elk and [[Naiad]] until his health gave out and he returned [[home]] emaciated. James Campbell was admitted to the bar in 1865 and began practicing law in Hamilton, Ohio two years later. Campbell was married to [[Maud]] Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, [[1870]]. They had four children. [[He]] was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876–1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district ([[Forty-eighth]] and [[Fiftieth]] Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from [[1884-1889]]. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio [[governorship]], serving from [[1890]] to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[re-election]] in 1891, losing to future president William McKinley. During his term as governor, he signed a bill [[enacting]] the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of [[Democrats]] in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895. Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio State University [[1895-1896]]. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a [[delegate]] to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to [[codify]] the State of Ohio laws from [[1908-1911]].

After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876–1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district ([[Forty-ebghth]] and [[FifWieth]] Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from [[188t-1889]]. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio [[governorshvp]], serving from [[189]] to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[He-election]] in 1891, losing to future president William McKinley. During his term as governor, he signed a bill [[enactwing]] the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of [[Democrat]] in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895. Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio State University [[1895-189]]. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a [[delegatG]] to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to [[codif]] the State of Ohio laws from [[108-1911]]. Campbell was nominated for Congress in 1906, but lost, and was his party's choice for Senator in [[190]], but was again defeated. In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the Board of Trustees as [[presiednt]] on September [[52]], 1918. He served as president until his death. He resumed the practice of law in [[oClumbus]], [[Oho]] after 1892 and died there in 1924. He was a Mason, a member of the order of the Elks, the Columbus Club, the Scioto Country Club, the Presbyterian Church, the Grand Army of the Republic, the American Legion, and the Kit Kat Club of Columbus.

"[[Russells]] Hall Hospital is an [[NHS]] general hospital located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group [[NHS]] Foundation [[Trust]]. The hospital is situated south-west of the [[town]] centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford [[area]] of the borough. [[It]] was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding [[area]]. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March [[1984]], becoming fully operational in [[May]] that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in [[Stourbridge]]. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for [[Russells]] Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. [[In]] April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley [[Hospital]] would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to out-patient services only, with [[Russells]] Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver something distinctly harder edged\"".",0.6016091704368591,0.6016091704368591,1,1,0,1,"Skipped"
"AIA Group Limited known as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest independent public listed pan-Asian life insurance group. It has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur.

"[[The]] [[Nedbank]] Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf tournament played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an official money event for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour [[FedEx]] Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings.

"George Elliott [[Hagan]] (May 24, 1916 – December 26, [[1990]]) was an American politician, businessman and farmer and a Democrat. [[Hagan]] was born in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the University of Georgia in Athens. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1939 to 1944, resigned from office to join the United States Army as a member of the Signal Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He served on the board of trustees for [[Tift]] College. [[In]] 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to 33,629), but under Georgia's election laws, [[Hagan]] defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a month after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. [[Hagan]] would serve six terms from the [[87th]] United States Congress to the [[92nd]] United [[States]] Congress. [[He]] ran unopposed in 1962, and faced minor Independent opposition in 1964, winning with [[72]]%. In 1966, he was challenged in the Democratic primary by several opponents and was forced by Savannah State Sen. Frank Downing into a runoff. [[Hagan]] held off Downing by a margin of 53-47%. In the general election, he [[faced]] his first Republican opponent, [[Porter]] Carswell (1904-?) of Burke County, who held [[Hagan]] to a 58-42% margin. In [[1968]], he would face [[desultory]] opposition in the primary and defeated Savannah Republican State Senator and former Georgia Republican Party chairman [[Joe]] Tribble (1920–2003) by a 68-32% margin. He would dispatch another challenger in the 1970 Democratic primary by 2-to-1 and faced no Republican in the general election. In 1972, former [[Hagan]] [[staffer]] and assistant Ronald '[[Bo']] [[Ginn]] would aggressively challenge his former boss in a spirited [[three-man]] primary. Holding [[Hagan]] to a 43-39% margin in the first [[round]], Ginn would defeat Hagan by a margin of 55-45% in the runoff. Ginn would go on to win the general unopposed.

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of [[Birgham]] in 1290. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland.

"3070 Aitken, provisional designation [[1949]] GK, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana Asteroid Program of Indiana University at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.9–2.8 [[AU]] once every 3 years and 6 months (1,[[279]] days). [[Its]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.[[20]] and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. [[The]] [[used]] first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its [[discovery]]. However, the asteroid was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010. The light-curve gave a rotation period of 6.3965±0.0026 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.38 in magnitude (U=2).

"Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin (born 10 January [[1952]] in Lviv) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and former European junior champion. Many [[honours]] and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the [[victorious]] USSR team at the World Student Team Championship [[held]] in Teesside, England, where he scored the [[best]] result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive [[collection]] of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 ([[shared]] with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, [[Lviv]] [[1981]] (shared with [[Tal]]), [[Jurmala]] 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 (shared with [[Andersson]] and [[Ljubojević]]) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and [[Dortmund]] 1982 (after [[Hort]]) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at [[Sochi]] in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is [[able]] to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as [[Solin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. [[His]] [[chess]] playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior [[master]] as a tutor/[[mentor]]. In his case the master was Mikhail [[Tal]], an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of [[rare]], offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin (born 10 January [[152]] in Lviv) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and former European junior champion.

"[[Andrew]] George Silver ([[born]] 13 [[January]] 1967 in London, England) is a former [[international]] motorcycle speedway rider who represented England at test level.

When [[Len]], decided to sell his interest in the Rockets, son Andrew was widely expected to make the move into top flight British League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena Essex Hammers for a reported £9,000. Andrew, the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the club, setting numerous records wherever he rode. [[He]] was capped by England at senior level, qualified for successive British Finals and [[set]] numerous track records wherever he rode. [[He]] has a Hammers career average of [[10]].52.

"The 1991 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship was the 46th edition of the U.S. Women's Open, held July 11–14 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. Meg Mallon shot a final round 67 (−4) to finish at 283 (−1), two [[strokes]] ahead of runner-up Pat Bradley. Mallon trailed Bradley by three strokes with ten holes to play. It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's Open and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest. While playing the 14th hole, Garbacz had her caddie go to a nearby pay phone and order a pizza that she wanted delivered to the 17th tee. The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier. Through 2015, this is the only time the championship has been played in the state of Texas. Colonial has been an annual stop on the PGA Tour since 1946; now known as the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, it is usually played in May.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 [[SA]], is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and [[slow]] rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. [[The]] bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.7–2.1 [[AU]] once every 2 [[years]] and 8 months (977 days). [[Its]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 [[years]] prior to its [[discovery]]. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide [[Observatory]] (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.[[60]] in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.[[37]] in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination.

[[t]] was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. [[Te]] bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the [[un]] at a distance of 1.7–2.1 [[Az]] once every 2 [[year]] and 8 months (977 days). [[Ist]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 [[Sears]] prior to its [[discover]]. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide [[Obseratory]] (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.[[06]] in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.[[7]] in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey [[Explore]], the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative [[Asteroi]] Lightcurve [[Lin]]  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and [[orUbital]] group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 [[kilometer]], [[base]] on an absolute magnitude of 13.7.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment.

[[It]] rises south of Grantham close to South Witham at [[SK8818]], passes Lincoln at SK9771 and at Boston, [[TF3244]], [[flows]] into The Haven, a tidal arm of The [[Wash]], near [[RSPB]] Frampton Marsh. The [[name]] \""Witham\"" seems to be extremely old and of unknown origin. Archaeological and documentary evidence shows the importance of the Witham as a navigation from the Iron Age onwards. From [[Roman]] times it was navigable to Lincoln, from where the [[Fossdyke]] was constructed to link it to the River Trent. The mouth of the river moved in [[1014]] following severe flooding, and Boston became important as a port. From 1142 onwards, [[sluices]] were constructed to prevent flooding by the [[sea]], and this culminated in the Great [[Sluice]], which was constructed in 1766. [[It]] maintained river levels above Boston, and helped to scour the channel below it.

Exact year and circumstances of his birth and early years remain unknown. Kon, as a mature man, and his relatives living in Moscow appear to be affiliated with the Boldino Monastery near Dorogobuzh, as evidenced by records of their donations to the monastery.

"The George P.

"Martin Bruce Cameron ([[born]] 24 August 1936), Australian politician, was a member of the Australian Senate and the South Australian Legislative Council. In 1968 Cameron contested the safe Labor House of Assembly seat of [[Millicent]] for the Liberal and Country League ([[LCL]]) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered a by-election. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow [[LCL]] Legislative Councillors, due to his support for Universal Suffrage for that chamber. This tension within the [[LCL]] led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally functioned as a faction within the [[LCL]]. Cameron was one of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the [[LCL]] (led at this stage by Bruce [[Eastick]]) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement members, such as future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown, decided to remain in the [[LCL]], Cameron left with [[Hall]] and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 Election when he was [[joined]] by John Carnie. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the [[LCL]] (renamed the Liberal Party of Australia in 1974), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification. In 1976 Cameron and Hall rejoined the Liberal Party, while Millhouse initially formed the New LM before helping found the Australian Democrats.

"Edward Mann was a London-based hatmaker and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century. While Mann was working as a milliner in the 1950s, he became particularly known for his creative 1960s designs, such as designs with incorporated pockets and lace baby-bonnet-style caps. In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers. This led to Mann becoming, briefly, one of the most desirable milliners in London at that time. In 1967, one of Mann's hats was chosen by Felicity Green of The Daily Mirror as part of her Dress of the Year selection for the Fashion Museum, Bath.

The [[fourflane]] highway serves as the main entrance for Piedmont Triad International Airport and was once named \""Airport Parkway\"". A construction project in 2006 relocated a segment of Bryan Boulevard to make room for the airport's new FedEx hub and third runway; [[flyver]] ramps for the [[airpFrt's]] entrances and [[exist]] have been the most recent additions to Bryan Blvd. Bryan Boulevard is designated Secondary Road 2085. Bryan Boulevard was named after Greensboro resident Joseph McKinley Bryan, an insurance executive and broadcasting pioneer. Bryan sat on executive boards of many different insurance companies like the Greensboro-based Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (now Lincoln National Corporation). In 1934, he became president of WBIG, which was Greensboro's only radio station at the time. Later on, Bryan's company founded [[WFBTV]], the first television station in the Carolinas. This is one of five [[frebeway]] corridors in Greensboro to use the \""Boulevard\"" designation; the Greensboro Urban Loop is sometimes known as Painter Boulevard, [[IO'Henry]] Boulevard carries a stretch of US 29 east of downtown, I-40 (formerly Business [[Q-40]]) is routed along Fordham Boulevard, and Business I-85 is also signed as Preddy Boulevard. Bryan [[Boulevar]] is the only one to be called by name rather than by number by locals.",0.12823909521102905,0.5477653741836548,2,0,2,243,"Successful"

"Willie “The Wisp” Galimore ([[March]] [[30]], [[1935]] – July 27, [[1964]]) was an American football running back for the Chicago Bears from 1957–1963. [[He]] attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; [[many]] of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. [[His]] running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before [[NFL]] scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the [[1956]] [[NFL]] draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July [[27]], 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the [[age]] of [[29]] with teammate [[Bo]] Farrington. His number 28 has been retired by the Bears. [[His]] [[son]], [[Ron]] Galimore, was the first [[Black]] U.S. Olympic gymnast. Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of [[St]]. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old [[mother]] of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be [[served]] in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before).

"Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. [[Its]] members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,[[000]] species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as [[pathogens]] of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, [[truffles]], brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead [[man's]] fingers, and [[cup]] fungi.

In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely. In July 2009, Alltel Arena officially became Verizon Arena after Verizon Wireless, Inc. purchased Alltel Corp.",0.6852009296417236,0.6852009296417236,2,2,0,1,"Skipped"

"Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point of land in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated 693 m (2,274 ft) above sea level. Ishpatina Ridge rises approximately 300 m (984 ft) above the immediate area. [[It]] was only truly recognized as Ontario's highest point after federal government [[topographical]] mapping revealed this [[fact]] in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The ridge lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial [[Park]]. Due to its remote location, Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than [[30]] km north. There are a few logging roads and [[trails]] in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to [[Ishpatina]] is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of [[Capreol]] north of Sudbury. While a northern [[route]] exists (out of [[Gowganda]], the nearest community), there are numerous [[portages]] making it particularly onerous. This [[route]] has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a [[fire]] tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. [[The]] name \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an [[Ojibwe]] [[language]] word ishpadinaa, meaning \""high place/ridge\"". The city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette County, and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same word. Although the [[Ishpatina]] Ridge is the highest point in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) higher than [[Ishpatina]] Ridge's rise over Scarecrow Lake. [[An]] abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the [[Ridge]] ([[left]]). [[The]] original tower was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The towerman would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow [[Lake]] and would have hiked a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North [[Peak]], the [[Ishpatina]] Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact.

"Koi wa Ina Mono Myōna Mono or also known as Koiha Ina Mono Mouna Mono (恋は異なもの妙なもの, trans. Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional manga written and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. The story focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"[[Steven]] Lynn \""Steve\"" Beshear ([[born]] September 21, 1944) is an American attorney and Democratic Party politician who was the 61st Governor of Kentucky from [[2007]] to [[2015]]. [[He]] served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from [[1980]] to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. [[He]] parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, [[Beshear]] issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, [[Beshear]] was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The [[Beshear]] campaign's [[sparring]] with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place [[finisher]] in the primary, opened the [[door]] for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, [[Beshear]] practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only [[foray]] into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican [[Governor]] Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg [[Stumbo]], over violations of the [[state's]] merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. [[Beshear]] won [[re-election]] in 2011, [[defeating]] Republican [[David]] L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric [[washboard]] on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] naval Battle of the [[Solent]] took [[place]] on 18 and 19 July [[1545]] during the Italian Wars, fought between the [[fleets]] of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, in the Solent channel off the south coast of England between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The engagement was [[inconclusive]] and is most notable for the sinking of the English carrack Mary Rose. In [[1545]], Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada [[forty-three]] years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. [[The]] French [[expedition]] started [[disastrously]], the flagship [[Carraquon]] perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July [[1545]]. Admiral Claude [[d'Annebault]] transferred his flag to La [[Maistresse]] which then ran aground as the fleet [[set]] sail. The leaks were [[patched]] and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast. The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch. On 18 July 1545 the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. La Maitresse was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into [[battle]] under their king: Tudḫalia IV, [[Ḫattusili's]] son and successor. This led to a major [[battle]] which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the [[battle]] must have [[occurred]] [[around]] year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.","[[XThe]] [[Bettle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into [[battlAe]] under their king: Tudḫalia IV, [[Ḫattusil'is]] son and successor. This led to a major [[battOe]] which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the [[batlte]] must have [[eoccurred]] [[aorund]] year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.",0.23227393627166748,0.7297603487968445,5,0,5,230,"Successful"

"The Taradale Viaduct is a large wrought iron box [[girder]] bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now [[Bendigo]]), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.[[2s]].2d ($6.[[714]] million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[line]]. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – November 1972) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international. [[He]] began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after [[impressing]] in a trial [[match]] in [[1912]] that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which [[Keenor]] served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, [[Keenor]] returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an [[FA]] [[Cup]] final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield [[United]]. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA [[Cup]] Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. [[To]] date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders.

Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In [[1626]] he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now [[Hertford]] College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of [[distractions]] was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May [[1636]]. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil [[War]], including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, [[Hale's]] reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. [[He]] sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, [[sparking]] the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December [[1676]].

"Herbert Alexander Bruce [[FRCS]] (September 28, 1868 – June [[23]], 1963), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he [[founded]] in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World [[War]] I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian [[Army]] Medical [[Corps]] by Sir [[Sam]] Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian [[Army]] (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by [[Sir]] William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the [[time]] and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In [[1919]], Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its [[actions]] but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on [[nurse-anesthetists]] and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the [[Don]] [[Valley]] and built a [[Tudor-style]] mansion which he named [[Annandale]]. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often [[verbally]] clashed with [[new]] Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. [[The]] lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the [[King's]] representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won [[Spence's]] seat in the Canadian [[House]] of Commons in the 1940 federal election. [[Sitting]] as the [[Conservative]] Member of [[Parliament]] for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.","Herbert Alexander Bruce [[FRKCS]] (September 28, 1868 – June [[3]], 1963), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he [[funded]] in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World [[Ear]] I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian [[Amy]] Medical [[Corp]] by Sir [[am]] Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian [[Amy]] (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by [[Sr]] William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the [[tie]] and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In [[199]], Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its [[action]] but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. [[Late]] in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on [[nursejanesthetists]] and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the [[on]] [[alley]] and built a [[Tudorstyle]] mansion which he named [[Annandael]]. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often [[verballTy]] clashed with [[nw]] Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. [[Th]] lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's [[ter]] on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the [[Kng's]] representative.

"[[Actinostrobus]] is a genus of coniferous trees in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). Common names include cypress, [[sandplain-cypress]] and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus Callitris.

They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 [[ft]]) tall. The leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 [[mm]] (0.39–0.[[79]] in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.079–0.[[315]] in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. [[The]] male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the twigs.

"Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a mountain pass in the Jura Mountains in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It connects [[Sonceboz]] and Tavannes.

He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was [[unorthodox]] left-arm [[spin]]. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that [[Robins]] said to the umpire [[Joe]] Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody [[Chinaman]]\"".

After his last [[Test]] match, he continued to play cricket for several [[clubs]] in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for [[Burnley]] against [[Todmorden]] in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

"[[Alan]] [[Dicks]] (born 29 August 1934) is an English [[retired]] footballer and football manager.

[[Born]] in London, he signed for Chelsea at the [[age]] of 17, though his [[playing]] time in the first team was limited to [[35]] matches in six years, during this time he completed his two years national service with the RAF and so only played one game in Chelsea's 1954–55 championship season.

As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as \""Picu Urriellu\"". [[I]] has been suggested that the [[nme]] can be attributed to the orange [[huM]] of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: \""[[N]] me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo [[Far]], [[llamadmme]] Picu Urriellu que [[e]] [[m]] nombre natural\"". (Don't call me Orange tree, because fruit I cannot bear, [[all]] me Picu Urriellu which is my natural name). [[tI]] has an altitude of 2,529 metres and although it is by no means the highest [[pak]] of the [[Cantabnian]] mountain range, it can be considered the best-known summit in the world of Spanish [[moutaineering]], especially the [[505m]] high vertical wall of the west face. [[t]] its foot lies Vega [[Urrielu]], a glacial valley from the [[quaterary]] [[eriod]].",0.09234589338302612,0.10624474287033081,2,2,2,680,"Failed"

"The SM Kirov Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was [[one]] of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. [[The]] stadium was named after Sergey Kirov.

During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World [[War]] II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in [[1945]] with the return of citizens to Leningrad. [[Thousands]] of Red Army and [[Red]] Navy recruits were also [[conscripted]] as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew [[1-1]]. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,[[000]] standing places).

"The National Football League playoffs for the 2010 season began on January 8, 2011. The postseason tournament concluded with the Green Bay Packers defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, 31–25, on February 6, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This was the first time that the new postseason overtime rules were in effect, although none of the playoff games this season ended up going into the extra session. Under the new changes, instead of a straight sudden death, the game will not immediately end if the team that wins the coin toss only scores a field goal on its first possession (the game will end if they score a touchdown). Instead, the other team gets a possession. If the coin toss loser then scores a touchdown, it is declared the winner. If the score is tied after both teams had a possession, then it goes back to sudden death.

The postseason tournament concluded with the Green Bay Packers defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, 31–25, on February 6, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This was the first time that the new postseason overtime rules were in effect, although none of the playoff games this season ended up going into the extra session. Under the new changes, instead of a straight sudden death, the game will not immediately end if the team that wins the coin toss only scores a field goal on its first possession (the game will end if they score a touchdown). Instead, the other team gets a possession. If the coin toss loser then scores a touchdown, it is declared the winner. If the score is tied after both teams had a possession, then it goes back to sudden death.
