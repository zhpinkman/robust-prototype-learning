"On 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

[[The]] [[hospital]] is situated [[south-west]] of the [[town]] centre on the A4101 [[road]], which [[connects]] to the [[Kingswinford]] [[area]] of the borough. [[It]] was [[first]] planned in the [[1960s]] as a [[general]] [[hospital]] for [[Dudley]] and the surrounding [[area]]. [[The]] first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in [[1976]] as a [[laundry]] [[centre]] for the [[borough's]] [[hospitals]], and the [[general]] hospital [[buildings]] were built within the [[next]] five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to [[patients]] until [[March]] [[1984]], [[becoming]] fully operational in [[May]] that [[year]]. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and [[emergency]] unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the [[NHS]] [[first]] began to consider the [[closure]] of Dudley [[Guest]] [[Hospital]]. In 1992, [[plans]] were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and [[Dudley]] [[Guest]] hospitals, as well as [[parts]] of the [[Corbett]] Hospital. [[There]] was much protest against this, and over the [[next]] few years there were several [[amendments]] to the [[proposals]] - including a [[move]] which [[would]] have [[seen]] Wordsley [[Hospital]] [[keep]] its maternity [[services]] but for all other services to relocate to [[Russells]] Hall. In [[April]] 1998, [[however]], it was [[decided]] that Wordsley [[Hospital]] would [[close]] completely and Corbett and [[Dudley]] Guest would be [[downsized]] to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being [[expanded]] to include all of the [[borough's]] [[in-patient]] [[services]]. [[The]] first phases of the work were [[completed]] in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing [[hospital]] was also refurbished. The [[Princess]] Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 ‚Äì 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the [[completion]] of the expanded [[hospital]] and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley [[town]] [[centre]] - Kingswinford [[Road]] - was widened into a dual [[carriageway]] in 2003. [[The]] car park was also expanded around the same time - a [[move]] which saw [[several]] [[houses]] along High Street demolished in 1999. Cricketer Ian Botham, famous for his charity work, opened a state of the [[art]] leukaemia unit at the hospital in 1998. Pop star and [[actor]] Martin Kemp opened the hospital's new CT scanning suite in January 2006, a decade after he recovered from brain cancer with the help of pioneering treatment.

"\""[[Space]] [[Invaders]]\"" is a [[song]] by Australian [[songwriters]] Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the [[band]] name [[Player]] One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979.

The [[song]] was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, [[influential]] in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse [[Saunders]] for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984). Dunlop and [[Brown]] also released an album as Player [[One]], [[Game]] [[Over]].

"Pine Islet [[Light]], also known as [[Percy]] Isles [[Light]], is an active lighthouse [[located]] at Pine Islet, a small islet belonging to the [[Percy]] [[Isles]] group of the Northumberland [[Islands]], about [[130]] [[kilometres]] (81 mi) southeast of Mackay, Queensland, [[Australia]]. The original lighthouse, [[established]] [[1885]], was [[active]] for a [[hundred]] years, until it was deactivated in 1985, by then the last kerosene powered lighthouse in Australia. It was relocated to the [[Mackay]] Marina in 1985 and restored to full [[working]] condition, making it the last fully [[functional]] kerosene [[operated]] lighthouse in the world. At the original location now stands a modern [[fiberglass]] [[tower]]. [[The]] light was [[first]] proposed in 1881 and again in 1882. Tenders were called in 1883, and the lighthouse was constructed by W. P. Clark in 1885, a typical [[Queensland]] lighthouse built of a [[hardwood]] frame clad with galvanized [[iron]] plates. The light source and the apparatus were upgraded in 1923 and in [[1934]] respectively. The cottages were replaced in 1927. The station received electricity in 1950, but the [[light]] remained kerosene operated until it was decommissioned in [[1985]]. Reconstruction of the [[lighthouse]] at Mackay, where it stands today, took from 1989 to [[1995]]. The lighthouse is accessible to the [[public]] and tours are available.

The original lighthouse, [[establishe‘Å]] [[18]] [[85]], was [[activ–µ]] for a [[hundre‘Å]] years, until it was deactivated in 1985, by then the last kerosene powered lighthouse in Australia. It was relocated to the [[Macùíåay]] Marina in 1985 and restored to full [[worùíåing]] condition, making it the last fully [[functiona‚Öº]] kerosene [[operate‘Å]] lighthouse in the world. At the original location now stands a modern [[fibreglass]] [[t–æwer]]. [[Te]] light was [[firsùöù]] proposed in 1881 and again in 1882. Tenders were called in 1883, and the lighthouse was constructed by W. P. Clark in 1885, a typical [[Queenslan‘Å]] lighthouse built of a [[hardwoo‘Å]] frame clad with galvanized [[ion]] plates. The light source and the apparatus were upgraded in 1923 and in [[1394]] respectively. The cottages were replaced in 1927. The station received electricity in 1950, but the [[lig’∞t]] remained kerosene operated until it was decommissioned in [[19]] [[85]]. Reconstruction of the [[lighhouse]] at Mackay, where it stands today, took from 1989 to [[l995]]. The lighthouse is accessible to the [[publiœ≤]] and tours are available.

From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters.

[[After]] [[winning]] the [[European]] [[Junior]] Championship in [[1973]], he [[became]] an [[International]] [[Master]] the same year. In [[1974]] he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the [[World]] [[Student]] [[Team]] Championship held in [[Teesside]], [[England]], where he scored the [[best]] result for [[board]] 4 (8/[[9]]). The [[following]] [[year]], he had a terrific result at the USSR [[Championship]], [[sharing]] [[second]] place with [[Boris]] [[Gulko]], [[Mikhail]] [[Tal]] and Rafael [[Vaganian]], after [[Tigran]] [[Petrosian]]. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament [[victories]] including [[Odessa]] [[1974]], [[Novi]] [[Sad]] [[1975]], [[Yerevan]] [[1976]], Hastings [[1976]]/[[77]], [[Leningrad]] 1977 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Gausdal [[1979]], [[Polanica]] Zdroij [[1980]], [[Lviv]] 1981 (shared with Tal), [[Jurmala]] [[1983]], [[Moscow]] [[1985]], [[Reggio]] [[Emilia]] [[1986]] ([[shared]] with Andersson and Ljubojeviƒá) and [[Debrecen]] 1990. [[Playing]] the [[Hungarian]] Open Championship at [[Gy√∂r]] in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, [[finishing]] a clear [[2]] [[points]] ahead of the field. [[Second]] [[place]] finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after [[Karpov]]) and [[Dortmund]] [[1982]] (after Hort) were [[also]] important [[landmarks]] in his [[career]], as was his [[3rd]]= [[finish]] at [[Sochi]] in 1982. [[Nowadays]] [[less]] active as a [[tournament]] player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to [[win]] [[smaller]] events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split [[2004]] and [[Hotel]] [[Petra]] (Rome) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he [[represented]] the Soviet Union in [[1978]] and thereafter [[played]] for Ukraine through the 1990s, [[winning]] a [[total]] of [[2]] silver [[medals]] and [[2]] bronze. [[At]] the [[European]] Team Chess [[Championships]] his medal [[haul]] has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and [[1]] silver. [[His]] chess playing style has been [[described]] as aggressive and this may be a result of the [[coaching]] he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first [[coached]] by [[Viktor]] [[Kart]] (an instructor of the [[Lviv]] Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior [[master]] as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an [[ex-world]] champion noted for his attacking [[chess]]. In [[respect]] of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, [[offbeat]] and sometimes, long [[since]] discarded systems. Only by means of [[deep]] research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the [[likes]] of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[O‚Öºeg]] [[Mikhailov—ñch]] [[Romanisin]] ([[bo‚≤Ön]] 10 [[Janua‚≤Öy]] [[195·íø]] in Lviv) is a [[Uk‚≤Öainian]] [[ches—ï]] [[grandmaste‚≤Ö]] and [[forme‚≤Ö]] [[Eu‚≤Öopean]] [[junio‚≤Ö]] [[chaÔΩçpion]].

[[P‚Öºaying]] the [[Hunga‚≤Öian]] Open Championship at [[Gy√∂‚≤Ö]] in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, [[fini—ïhing]] a clear [[·íø]] [[point—ï]] ahead of the field.

[[Hi—ï]] chess playing style has been [[describe‘Å]] as aggressive and this may be a result of the [[coaœ≤hing]] he received as a junior.

In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an [[exÀóworld]] champion noted for his attacking [[ch]] [[ess]]. In [[respecùöù]] of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, [[offbeaùöù]] and sometimes, long [[sinœ≤e]] discarded systems. Only by means of [[‘Åeep]] research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the [[l]] [[ikes]] of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.",0.09655344486236572,0.5189619064331055,0,0,0,2208,"Failed"

"3043 San Diego, [[provisional]] [[designation]] [[1982]] SA, is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] [[belt]], approximately 4.[[7]] [[kilometers]] in diameter. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American [[female]] astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar [[Observatory]] in California. The bright [[E-type]] [[asteroid]] is a member of the Hungaria family, which [[form]] the [[innermost]] dense [[concentration]] of asteroids in the Solar [[System]]. [[The]] asteroid orbits the Sun at a [[distance]] of [[1]].7‚Äì[[2]].1 AU once [[every]] 2 years and 8 [[months]] ([[977]] days). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. [[The]] first observation was taken at [[Crimea]]‚ÄìNauchnij in [[1974]], extending the [[asteroid's]] [[observation]] arc by [[8]] [[years]] prior to its discovery. In March [[2005]], a [[rotational]] light-curve for this [[asteroid]] was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer [[Brian]] D. Warner at his [[Palmer]] Divide [[Observatory]] (PDO), Colorado. It gave a [[long]] rotation [[period]] of [[105]].7¬±[[0]].1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=[[3-]]). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally [[gave]] a [[much]] shorter period of 30.72¬±[[0]].02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in [[magnitude]] (U=[[0]]). [[This]] previously published period was only preliminary and is now [[considered]] [[wrong]] [[upon]] re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of [[NASA's]] [[Wide-field]] Infrared [[Survey]] [[Explorer]], the asteroid [[measures]] 4.[[8]] kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an albedo of 0.[[28]], while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve [[Link]]  assumes an albedo of [[0]].30 ‚Äì a [[compromise]] value between 0.[[4]] and 0.[[2]], [[corresponding]] to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively ‚Äì and calculates a [[diameter]] of [[4]].6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of [[13]].[[7]].

"[[Martin]] [[Bruce]] [[Cameron]] (born [[24]] August [[1936]]), [[Australian]] politician, was a [[member]] of the Australian [[Senate]] and the South Australian Legislative [[Council]]. In 1968 [[Cameron]] contested the safe Labor House of Assembly seat of Millicent for the [[Liberal]] and [[Country]] League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des [[Corcoran]] on road [[transport]] control. [[Cameron]] gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which [[ordered]] a [[by-election]]. [[Corcoran]] comfortably won the by-election. Early in [[1969]], Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. [[However]], [[Cameron's]] time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 [[Federal]] Election in October and he was defeated by [[Labor's]] Don Cameron (no [[relation]]). [[Cameron]] entered South [[Australia's]] Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of [[Sir]] [[Norman]] Jude. He became an important ally of [[Steele]] Hall (now Leader of the [[Opposition]]), representing the increasingly visible [[moderate]] [[forces]] within the [[party]].

[[However]] the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the LCL (renamed the Liberal Party of [[Australia]] in 1974), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification.

"Ascomycota is a [[division]] or [[phylum]] of the [[kingdom]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the [[subkingdom]] [[Dikarya]]. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""[[ascus]]\"" (from Greek: [[·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ]] ([[askos]]), [[meaning]] \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which [[nonmotile]] spores, called [[ascospores]], are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form [[asci]] or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphological]] or [[physiological]] similarities to [[ascus-bearing]] taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a [[monophyletic]] group, i.[[e]]. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. [[This]] group is of particular relevance to [[humans]] as sources for [[medicinally]] [[important]] compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, [[alcoholic]] beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and [[baker's]] yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the [[majority]] of lichens (loosely termed \""[[ascolichens]]\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery [[mildews]]. Several species of ascomycetes are biological model [[organisms]] in laboratory research. Most famously, [[Neurospora]] [[crassa]], several species of yeasts, and [[Aspergillus]] species are [[used]] in [[many]] genetics and cell biology [[studies]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by [[Medeski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the [[Jam]] Cruise in 2010.

The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria.

Construction of the [[Bendigo]] [[line]] commenced under the [[Melbourne]], Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this [[private]] [[consortium]] met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian [[Railways]] Department. The design work was then taken over by [[Captain]] [[Andrew]] [[Clarke]], R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge [[designs]] completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for ¬£3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O‚ÄôHara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society‚Äôs Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934.

However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society‚Äôs Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934. [[Te]] bridge is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H1595). and the National Trust Register.",0.05721086263656616,0.6976665258407593,2,0,2,546,"Successful"

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] Hale SL (1 [[November]] [[1609]] ‚Äì [[25]] [[December]] 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treatise]] Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, or [[The]] History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his [[faith]]. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barrister]] like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On [[8]] [[November]] 1628 he [[joined]] [[Lincoln's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on [[17]] [[May]] [[1636]]. As a barrister, [[Hale]] represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the [[English]] [[Civil]] [[War]], including [[Thomas]] Wentworth and [[William]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to [[represent]] Charles I at his [[state]] trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] [[used]]. Despite the Royalist loss, [[Hale's]] reputation for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which [[investigated]] [[law]] reform. Following the [[Commission's]] [[dissolution]], [[Oliver]] [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to [[make]] [[politically]] unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the [[First]] Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the [[English]] Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was [[made]] first [[Chief]] Baron of the Exchequer and then [[Chief]] Justice of the [[King's]] [[Bench]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 [[February]] 1676, [[dying]] [[ten]] [[months]] later on [[25]] December [[1676]]. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written [[work]], published after his [[death]]. [[His]] Historia [[Placitorum]] [[Coron√¶]], dealing with [[capital]] offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the [[Common]] Law is noted as the [[first]] published history of [[English]] law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural [[law]].

"[[Ellis]] [[Edgar]] \""Puss\"" Achong (16 [[February]] [[1904]] ‚Äì [[29]] August [[1986]]) was a [[sportsman]] from Trinidad and Tobago in the West [[Indies]].

"State Route 1 is primarily the unsigned partner route assigned to U.S. Highway 431. The two routes are co-aligned from the southern terminus of US-431 at Dothan to the Tennessee state line. South of Dothan, State Route 1 is assigned to U.S. Highway 231. The two highways run north from Dothan through the Wiregrass region of southeastern Alabama through the towns of Headland and Abbeville en route to Eufaula, where it intersects U.S. Route 82. North of Eufaula, en route to Phenix City, the highway encounters some of the most sparsely populated parts of the state, only passing near the unincorporated communities of Pittsview, Glenville, and Seale in the 46 mile (74 km) drive between the two cities. In Phenix City, the highway junctions with U.S. Route 280 and U.S. Route 80. North of Phenix City, en route to Opelika, US 431 and US 280 join together for a concurrency, passing through the cities of Smiths Station and Salem on the way into Opelika. In Opelika, the two highways cross Interstate 85 and split in Opelika; US 431 continuing northeastward and US 280 northwestward.

"The SM [[Kirov]] [[Stadium]] was a [[multi-purpose]] [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest [[stadiums]] anywhere in the world. The [[stadium]] was [[named]] after [[Sergey]] Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov [[stadium]] was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games.

[[Kerferd]] emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. [[After]] trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and [[wine]] merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and [[three]] other [[occasions]]. In 1853 he married [[Ann]] Martindale, with whom he had [[ten]] children. [[Kerferd]] was [[admitted]] to the Melbourne [[bar]] in 1867 but did not practise as a [[lawyer]].

[[However]], after his three appearances in this series, [[South]] Africa were [[banned]] from international [[cricket]] because of apartheid.

He is of [[Greeùíå]] descent, his father having been born in Lemnos, [[Greeœ≤e]] and his maternal [[grandmothe‚≤Ö]] in [[Kalymns]], also in [[Greeœ≤e]]. In [[Septembe‚≤Ö]] [[194»¢]] the family moved to what was then [[Forùöù]] [[V—ñctoria]] in [[Southe‚≤Ön]] Rhodesia. As a child he was known as \""[[Nas–æ]]\"", a contraction of his name \""Athanasios\"", but when he [[strted]] [[universiùöùy]] he adopted the name \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""[[provinœ≤e]]\"" within the [[Souùöùh]] African domestic [[crickeùöù]] [[seùöùup]]. [[Whi‚Öºe]] a [[studenùöù]] at the [[Universiùöùy]] of [[Nata‚Öº]] he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard [[maùíåing]] his first-class [[de–¨ut]] on 24 June 1967 when he represented [[Souùöùh]] African Universities against Cambridge [[Universiùöùy]], taking 5‚Äì54 in the [[firsùöù]] [[inning—ï]]. He [[represente‘Å]] the South African Universities team on two more [[occasion—ï]] before [[maùíåing]] his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. He [[mae]] his Test match debut for [[Souùöùh]] [[Afriœ≤a]] against [[Austra‚Öºia]] at Durban in February 1970 while [[stil‚Öº]] a student, having been selected at the request of the South African [[capùöùain]] Ali Bacher. He took four [[catche—ï]] and three [[wicket—ï]] in his [[debuùöù]] Test. [[Howeve‚≤Ö]], after his three appearances in this series, [[Souùöùh]] Africa were [[banne‘Å]] from international [[crickeùöù]] because of apartheid. [[Traico—ï]] continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented [[Zimbab‘ùe]] in the [[198·íø]], 1986 and [[19‡ß≠0]] [[IC]] Trophy tournaments. He [[al—ïo]] [[playe‘Å]] for [[Zimbab‘ùe]] in the [[19»¢3]] [[Crickeùöù]] World Cup, and was an important part of the side which inflicted a shock defeat on [[Austra‚Öºia]]. [[Zimbab‘ùe]] were raised to Test status in 1992, and Traicos was selected for the [[count‚≤Öy's]] [[inaugura‚Öº]] [[Tesùöù]] match, at Harare [[Sport—ï]] [[C‚Öºub]] against [[In‘Åia]]. This appearance [[caÔΩçe]] a record 22 years and 222 [[das]] after his previous [[Tesùöù]] [[appearanœ≤e]], and he [[r–µpaid]] the [[s]] [[electors']] decision with his [[besùöù]] [[Tesùöù]] [[bow‚Öºing]] figures of 5/86.

He would have been even further up the list had he been available for selection for the following year's tour of Pakistan, but Traicos' business commitments prevented this.

At 567 metres (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the [[tallest]] [[dam]] in the world, [[either]] natural or [[man-made]]. The [[dam]] was [[created]] on [[February]] 18, 1911, when the 7.[[4-Ms]] [[Sarez]] [[earthquake]] caused a massive landslide that [[blocked]] the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is [[formed]] of approximately 2 cubic kilometres ([[0]].48 cu mi) of [[rock]] dislodged from the [[steeply]] sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains.
