"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel [[Winterburn]] made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"Augustus George Hazard (April 28, 1802 – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an American manufacturer of gunpowder and the namesake of Hazardville, Connecticut. Hazard was [[born]] in Kingston, Rhode Island on April 28, 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs.

[[The]] [[British]] squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Sir]] Edward [[Pellew]]—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the [[trade]] route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of [[Dutch]] raiders operating from the principal [[Javan]] port of Batavia.

"James [[Edwin]] [[Campbell]] (July 7, 1843 – [[December]] [[18]], [[1924]]) was a [[Democratic]] politician from Ohio. He served as the [[38th]] [[Governor]] of Ohio. [[Campbell]] was born in [[Middletown]], Ohio where he attended the [[public]] [[schools]] and then [[Miami]] [[University]]. He served in the Union Army as a [[member]] of the Mississippi River [[Squadron]] during the [[Civil]] War. He was a [[master's]] mate on the gunboats [[Elk]] and Naiad until his health gave out and he returned [[home]] [[emaciated]]. James Campbell was admitted to the [[bar]] in [[1865]] and began practicing law in [[Hamilton]], Ohio two years later. Campbell was married to [[Maud]] [[Elizabeth]] [[Owens]] of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, 1870. They had four children. He was a [[Republican]] who voted for Lincoln and Grant for [[President]], and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876–1880, Campbell was [[elected]] as a Democrat to the [[United]] [[States]] House of [[Representatives]] twice from Ohio's [[7th]] congressional [[district]] ([[Forty-eighth]] and Fiftieth Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once [[held]] by his uncle [[Lewis]] D. Campbell, serving from [[1884-1889]]. In the 49th [[Congress]], he was [[chairman]] of the House [[Committee]] on Alcoholic [[Liquor]] Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio governorship, serving from 1890 to [[1892]]. He was an unsuccessful candidate for [[re-election]] in 1891, losing to [[future]] [[president]] William McKinley. During his term as [[governor]], he signed a bill enacting the Australian [[ballot]] in Ohio. He [[called]] a special session of the General [[Assembly]] to [[remove]] the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. [[This]] action cost him the support of Democrats in that part of the [[state]], and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for [[governor]] in 1895.

In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio [[Archaeological]] and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the [[Board]] of [[Trustees]] as president on [[September]] 25, 1918. He served as president until his death. He resumed the practice of [[law]] in [[Columbus]], Ohio after 1892 and died there in 1924.

On December 11 1979, he replaced [[Dante]] Silverio as Toyota head coach after Silverio resigned when management decides to reinstate Ramon [[Fernandez]], Estoy Estrada and Abe King for Game 2 of the ongoing PBA Invitational Conference finals. Acuña steered the team to the title against arch-rivals Crispa. This was Toyota's sixth title and Acuña's only PBA championship as head coach.

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has [[many]] character flaws, often played for comedic purposes.

"\""[[Space]] Invaders\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly [[stylised]] as Player [1]) in 1979.

It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and [[ending]] up as the fourth best selling [[single]] in Australia for 1980. The [[song]] was [[released]] internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the [[bassline]] of what is commonly [[held]] to be the [[first]] [[Chicago]] house music [[record]], \""On and On\"" ([[1984]]). Dunlop and Brown [[also]] [[released]] an album as Player One, Game Over.

"Malá Fatra (Slovak pronunciation: [[[ˈmalaː]] ˈfatra]; also Little Fatra or Lesser Fatra, Polish: Mała Fatra) is a mountain range in the Western Carpathians in the north-west of Central Slovakia. In the geomorphological system, it is a part of the [[Fatra-Tatra]] Area. It is situated approximately between the cities of [[Nitrianske]] Pravno, [[Strečno]], Martin and Zázrivá. Turčianska kotlina (Turiec Basin) and the Oravská vrchovina Mts. are situated to the west of the range, and Žilinská kotlina (Žilina Basin) and the Kysucká vrchovina Mts. is located to the east. Malá Fatra consists of two subdivisions separated by the Váh river near Strečno: \n*  Lúčanská Malá Fatra \n*  Krivánska Malá Fatra The highest peak is Veľký Kriváň at 1,709 m AMSL in Krivánska Malá Fatra. Malá Fatra is basically one big karst object. It is made up of crystalline rocks and complexes of Mesozoic strongly folded rocks. The main peaks of Lúčanská Malá Fatra are Veľká Lúka (1,475 m), Kľak (1,351 m) and Minčol (1,364).

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966.

Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles.

AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region.

"The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual [[men's]] professional golf tournament played at the [[Gary]] Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money event for any of the [[major]] tours, but it became an official tournament for the [[Sunshine]] Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like [[many]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%.

"Aznar (or Asnar) Sánchez (Basque: Aznar Antso, French: Aznard Sanche, Gascon: Aznar Sans) (died 836) was the Duke of Gascony from [[820]]. He was the supposed son of Sancho I of Gascony, though he has been identified with Aznar Galíndez I, Count of Aragon. In 820, Lupo III Centule rose in rebellion against Carolingian authority and Berengar of Toulouse and Guerin of Provence marched against him, defeated him, and installed Aznar, a count of local provenance, in his place. However, both Aragon and Navarre remained outside Carolingian control and western Gascony continued in revolt. In 824, according to the Vita Hludowici, the counts Aznar and Aeblus (Eblus atque Asenarius committees) led an army against rebellious Pamplona.

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in [[1290]]. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland.

"[[Pandora]] (/pænˈdɔərə/ [[pan-DOHR-ə]]; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner [[satellite]] of [[Saturn]]. [[It]] was discovered in [[1980]] from [[photos]] [[taken]] by the Voyager 1 [[probe]], and was provisionally designated S/[[1980]] S [[26]]. In late [[1985]] it was [[officially]] named after [[Pandora]] from Greek [[mythology]]. It is [[also]] designated as [[Saturn]] [[XVII]]. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent [[studies]] indicate that it does not [[play]] such a [[role]], and that only Prometheus, the inner [[shepherd]], contributes to the [[confinement]] of the narrow [[ring]]. It is more [[heavily]] cratered than [[nearby]] Prometheus, and has at [[least]] [[two]] large [[craters]] 30 kilometres ([[19]] [[mi]]) in [[diameter]]. The majority of craters on Pandora are [[shallow]] as a [[result]] of being filled with debris. Ridges and [[grooves]] are also [[present]] on moon's surface.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game.

"(148209) [[2000]] [[CR105]], [[also]] written as (148209) [[2000]] CR105, is the [[tenth-most-distant]] [[known]] [[object]] in the Solar System as of 2015. [[Considered]] a detached [[object]], it [[orbits]] the Sun in a highly eccentric [[orbit]] every [[3305]] [[years]] at an average distance of [[222]] astronomical units (AU). Mike [[Brown's]] [[website]] lists it as a possible [[dwarf]] planet with a [[diameter]] of 328 [[kilometres]] (204 mi) based on an [[assumed]] [[albedo]] of 0.[[04]]. [[The]] albedo is [[expected]] to be [[low]] because the [[object]] has a blue ([[neutral]]) color. [[However]], if the albedo is [[higher]], the [[object]] could easily be [[half]] that size. (148209) 2000 CR105 and Sedna differ from [[scattered-disc]] [[objects]] in that they are not [[within]] the [[gravitational]] [[influence]] of the planet Neptune [[even]] at their perihelion distances ([[closest]] [[approaches]] to the Sun). It is [[something]] of a [[mystery]] as to how these objects [[came]] to be in their [[current]], [[far-flung]] [[orbits]]. Several hypotheses have been [[put]] [[forward]]: \n*  They were pulled from their original [[positions]] by a [[passing]] star. \n*  They were [[pulled]] from their original [[positions]] by a very distant, and [[as-yet-undiscovered]] ([[albeit]] [[unlikely]]), [[giant]] planet. \n*  They were [[pulled]] from their [[original]] [[positions]] by an [[undiscovered]] companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were [[captured]] from another [[planetary]] [[system]] during a close [[encounter]] early in the Sun's history.

He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm [[continued]] in his [[office]] almost [[constantly]] for [[twenty-four]] [[years]], barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per year in 2012.","Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.

"90377 Sedna is a large [[minor]] [[planet]] in the [[outer]] reaches of the Solar System that was, as of [[2015]], at a [[distance]] of about [[86]] astronomical [[units]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[three]] times as [[far]] as [[Neptune]].

[[For]] most of its [[orbit]], it is [[even]] farther from the Sun than at present, with its [[aphelion]] estimated at [[937]] AU (31 times [[Neptune's]] [[distance]]), making it one of the most distant known objects in the [[Solar]] System other than long-period comets.

"The Jerusalem Light Rail (Hebrew: הרכבת הקלה בירושלים‎‎, Ha-Rakevet ha-Kala bi-Rushalayim) is a light rail system in Jerusalem. Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011. The line is 13.9 kilometers (8.6 mi) long with 23 stops. Extensions to the red line are currently under construction to the northern suburb of Neve Yaakov and to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital to the southwest. When completed in 2016, these will extend the line's length to 22.5 km. With a total estimated cost for the initial line of ₪3.8 billion (approx.

[[Stmabaugh]] [[Stadiuｍ]], is a [[multi-purpoѕe]] stadium in Youngstown, Ohio, United States, on the campus of Youngstown State University. The stadium was built in 1982, and is primarily used for American football. It is the home venue for the Youngstown State Penguins football team, a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I Football Championship Division (FCS) level and the Missouri Valley Football Conference. From 1996–2012, [[Stɑmbaugh]] Stadium was also the home field for the YSU women's soccer team. During their time at [[Stabaugh]], the football team has risen to become a power in FCS football, qualifying for NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs 12 times, advancing to the championship game on six occasions, and winning four national championships through the 2015 season. The stadium is also known by fans as the \""Ice Castle\"".

"The Arkansas RiverBlades was a short-lived minor-league ice hockey team located in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season.

"Koi wa Ina Mono Myōna Mono or also known as Koiha Ina Mono Mouna Mono (恋は異なもの妙なもの, trans. Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional manga written and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. The story focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation. This series was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Dear+ in 2002.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of [[bassist]] Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group.

"The [[Lackawanna]] Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad line that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling [[gradient]] (0.55% vs. [[1]].1%); and it had 42 [[fewer]] curves, with all but one [[permitting]] passenger train speeds of [[70]] mph (110 [[km]]/h) or more.

"Argus Brewery, Inc., is a brewing company located in the Roseland community of Chicago, Illinois and [[brews]] the Argus brand of beers. Argus produces the Ironhorse, Holsteiner Lager and Pegasus IPA line of beers as well as the Jarrett Payton’s All-American Wheat Ale private label brand. Robert and Patrick Jensen founded Argus Brewery in 2009, after producing house brand beers for two local area restaurants, Ballydoyle Irish Pub & Restaurant and Country House. The brewery is located in Chicago’s Roseland community at [[113th]] and South Front Avenue. The original building was constructed in the early 1900s and housed the Schlitz Brewing Company horse teams and carriages. Schlitz constructed its largest facility across the tracks from the Pullman Company to provide beer to the 10,000 area workers who were forced to live in a dry community. Argus Brewery started with four employees and, as of 2013, increased to 12. The company produces traditionally crafted beers. Argus’ original beers, Ironhorse, Holsteiner Lager and Pegasus IPA are found in local [[taverns]] and stores.

Argus produces the Ironhorse, Holsteiner Lager and Pegasus IPA line of beers as well as the Jarrett Payton’s All-American Wheat Ale private label brand. Robert and Patrick Jensen founded Argus Brewery in 2009, after producing house brand beers for two local area restaurants, Ballydoyle Irish Pub & Restaurant and Country House. The brewery is located in Chicago’s Roseland community at [[113h]] and South Front Avenue. The original building was constructed in the early 1900s and housed the Schlitz Brewing Company horse teams and carriages. Schlitz constructed its largest facility across the tracks from the Pullman Company to provide beer to the 10,000 area workers who were forced to live in a dry community. Argus Brewery started with four employees and, as of 2013, increased to 12. The company produces traditionally crafted beers. Argus’ original beers, Ironhorse, Holsteiner Lager and Pegasus IPA are found in local [[tavrens]] and stores.

"The Taradale Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray [[River]] Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, [[Wiltshire]], under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the [[line]]. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society’s Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934.

"Frederick Charles '[[Fred']] Keenor (31 July 1894 – November [[1972]]) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared [[sporadically]] for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which [[Keenor]] served in the [[17th]] ([[Service]]) Battalion, [[Middlesex]] Regiment, which [[became]] [[known]] as the Football Battalion, led by Major [[Frank]] [[Buckley]].

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] [[FRCS]] ([[September]] 28, [[1868]] – June 23, [[1963]]), [[served]] as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], from [[1932]] to [[1937]]. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, [[Bruce]] was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the Royal [[College]] of Surgeons. He [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in [[Toronto]] which he [[founded]] in [[1911]], and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during [[World]] War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general [[reorganization]] were immediately feasible from the military and economic [[points-of-view]], and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical [[profession]]. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his conservative [[patron]], [[Hughes]], was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce [[published]] [[Politics]] and the [[Canadian]] Army Medical [[Corps]], [[criticizing]] the [[government]] for its actions but [[avoiding]] any specific denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the [[war]], as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was [[able]] to advance some useful [[reforms]] in surgical management, [[including]] [[greater]] reliance on nurse-anesthetists and [[operating]] room technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don [[Valley]] and [[built]] a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant [[Governor]] of [[Ontario]] by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often [[verbally]] clashed with new Ontario Premier [[Mitch]] Hepburn who attempted to curtail the [[extravagance]] of the vice-regal office in the face of the [[Great]] Depression. The [[lieutenant-governor's]] [[official]] [[residence]], Chorley [[Park]], was [[closed]] by the [[Hepburn]] [[government]] at the end of [[Bruce's]] term on the [[pretext]] of cutting costs. [[While]] most [[lieutenant-governors]] are former politicians, Bruce [[took]] the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the [[King's]] [[representative]]. Following the [[sudden]] [[death]] of Conservative MP [[David]] Spence in the [[middle]] of the [[1940]] federal election [[campaign]], Bruce contested and won [[Spence's]] seat in the [[Canadian]] House of Commons in the [[1940]] federal [[election]]. Sitting as the [[Conservative]] [[Member]] of [[Parliament]] for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June [[23]], 1963.

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] SL (1 November [[1609]] – [[25]] [[December]] 1676) was an influential [[English]] [[barrister]], [[judge]] and [[lawyer]] most [[noted]] for his [[treatise]] [[Historia]] [[Placitorum]] Coronæ, or The [[History]] of the Pleas of the [[Crown]]. Born to a [[barrister]] and his [[wife]], who had both [[died]] by the time he was [[5]], [[Hale]] was [[raised]] by his father's [[relative]], a [[strict]] [[Puritan]], and inherited his [[faith]]. In [[1626]] he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, [[Oxford]] (now Hertford College), intending to become a [[priest]], but after a [[series]] of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barrister]] like his [[father]] thanks to an [[encounter]] with a Serjeant-at-Law in a [[dispute]] over his estate. On 8 [[November]] 1628 he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was [[called]] to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] [[1636]]. As a [[barrister]], [[Hale]] represented a variety of [[Royalist]] figures during the [[prelude]] and duration of the [[English]] Civil [[War]], including [[Thomas]] [[Wentworth]] and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his [[state]] [[trial]], and conceived the [[defence]] Charles used. Despite the [[Royalist]] [[loss]], Hale's reputation for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of [[England]] he was made Chairman of the [[Hale]] [[Commission]], which [[investigated]] [[law]] reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver [[Cromwell]] made him a [[Justice]] of the Common Pleas. As a judge, [[Hale]] was noted for his [[resistance]] to [[bribery]] and his [[willingness]] to make politically unpopular decisions which [[upheld]] the law. He sat in [[Parliament]], [[either]] in the Commons or the [[Upper]] [[House]], in every Parliament from the First [[Protectorate]] Parliament to the Convention [[Parliament]], and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the [[English]] [[Restoration]]. Under [[Charles]], Hale was [[made]] first [[Chief]] [[Baron]] of the [[Exchequer]] and then [[Chief]] Justice of the [[King's]] Bench. In both [[positions]], he was again noted for his integrity, [[although]] not as a [[particularly]] innovative [[judge]]. Following a bout of illness he retired on [[20]] [[February]] 1676, [[dying]] [[ten]] [[months]] later on [[25]] [[December]] 1676. [[Hale]] is almost [[universally]] appreciated as an excellent [[judge]] and [[jurist]], with his [[central]] [[legacy]] coming through his written work, published after his [[death]]. [[His]] Historia Placitorum [[Coronæ]], dealing with [[capital]] offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the [[highest]] authority\"", while his [[Analysis]] of the Common [[Law]] is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural [[law]]. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Siⲅ]] [[Mattheԝ]] [[Haⅼe]] SL (1 November [[160৭]] – [[2Ƽ]] [[Decembeⲅ]] 1676) was an influential [[Engliѕh]] [[bɑrrister]], [[juԁge]] and [[lawyeⲅ]] most [[noteԁ]] for his [[treatiѕe]] [[Histoⲅia]] [[Placito]] [[rum]] Coronæ, or The [[Hist]] [[ory]] of the Pleas of the [[Croԝn]].

"Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on 14 April in the Church of Greece. Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy [[born]] in [[Floka]] and [[raised]] in [[Ligouditsa]], both in the [[region]] of Arcadia, [[near]] the regional [[capital]] of [[Tripoli]]. [[As]] with most of Greece at the [[time]], the [[region]] was [[ruled]] by the [[Ottoman]] Empire. His [[mother]] died when he was very young, and his [[father]], [[Elias]], [[remarried]]. Due to [[ill-treatment]] by his [[stepmother]], [[Demetrius]] [[left]] [[home]] and went to seek work in [[Tripoli]], where he was apprenticed to a barber. He [[converted]] to [[Islam]] and took the name [[Mehmet]], but [[later]] repented and became an [[Orthodox]] monk on the island of [[Chios]]. [[Demetrius]] fell into a deep depression when the weight of his [[sin]] [[fully]] weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great [[penance]]: returning to Tripoli to [[confess]] publicly that he was recanting his [[conversion]] to Islam. [[His]] abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and [[publicly]] confessed his re-conversion to [[Christianity]] several times. [[This]] included him going to his former [[barber]] boss and asking him to slit his [[throat]] right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him [[detained]]. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for [[apostasy]] from Islam, convicted and [[sentenced]] to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish [[friend]], who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of [[Demetrius']] confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the [[judge's]] own [[desire]] to [[let]] him go. Finally, [[Demetrius]] was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully [[sang]] [[Christian]] hymns in his way), and [[publicly]] executed by beheading; it [[took]] three strokes, and his severed [[head]] and [[body]], though ordered to be [[burned]], were [[hidden]] and [[preserved]] by local [[Christians]] as relics.","Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on 14 April in the Church of Greece.

"[[Ellis]] [[Edgar]] \""[[Puss]]\"" Achong (16 February [[1904]] – 29 [[August]] 1986) was a sportsman from [[Trinidad]] and Tobago in the West [[Indies]]. He played [[cricket]] for the West [[Indies]] and was the first person of [[known]] [[Chinese]] [[descent]] to play in a Test match. [[Left-arm]] [[unorthodox]] [[spin]] ([[left-arm]] wrist spin) is sometimes [[known]] as \""[[slow]] [[left-arm]] chinaman\"" (SLC) which is [[thought]] to be in his [[honour]]. [[Achong]] was [[born]] in [[Belmont]], Port of [[Spain]]. He played football as a [[left-winger]] for a local [[team]], Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowler]]. His stock ball was left-arm [[orthodox]] spin ([[left-arm]] finger spin), but one of his variations was [[unorthodox]] [[left-arm]] spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at [[Old]] Trafford in 1933, it is [[reputed]] that [[Robins]] said to the [[umpire]] Joe [[Hardstaff]] [[Sr]]., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Learie]] [[Constantine]] is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox [[left-arm]] spin [[delivery]] (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a [[right-handed]] batsman) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl [[unorthodox]] [[left-arm]] spin – that is believed to be [[Charles]] Llewellyn of [[South]] Africa. Achong played in [[six]] [[Test]] matches for the West Indies against the [[English]] cricket team from 1930 to [[1935]], three in the West Indies and three in the [[1933]] tour of England. In all, [[Achong]] [[took]] eight [[Test]] wickets at a [[bowling]] average of 47.25, but his [[Test]] figures belie his [[much]] greater success at regional level in the [[West]] Indies between [[1929]]–30 and [[1934]]–35. In the final of the [[Inter-Colonial]] Tournament of [[1931]]–32, he [[took]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over [[British]] Guiana. He married during the [[1933]] tour of England and settled in Manchester. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the [[Lancashire]] Leagues until [[1951]], taking over 1,000 [[wickets]], [[including]] 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in [[1945]]. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

"[[Alan]] Dicks ([[born]] 29 August 1934) is an English retired [[footballer]] and [[football]] [[manager]]. He [[managed]] [[Bristol]] City for thirteen [[years]] and [[managed]] [[clubs]] in four countries on three continents. [[Born]] in [[London]], he [[signed]] for [[Chelsea]] at the [[age]] of [[17]], [[though]] his [[playing]] [[time]] in the [[first]] team was limited to [[35]] matches in [[six]] [[years]], during this [[time]] he completed his [[two]] [[years]] [[national]] [[service]] with the RAF and so only played one game in [[Chelsea's]] [[1954]]–[[55]] [[championship]] season. In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in [[1962]] [[joined]] Coventry [[City]] as assistant [[manager]]/coach under Jimmy Hill. In 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City. He took the job at the age of just 33, and held it for thirteen years. In that time he consolidated City's position in the Second Division, and eventually, in 1976, led them to promotion to the First Division – then English football's top flight. During his spell as manager the club also made the semi-finals of the 1971 League Cup and won the 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup. Dicks remained as manager throughout City's four-year stay in Division 1, but relegation and a poor start to the following season saw him leave in October 1980. Subsequently, City suffered three relegations in as many years. Dicks also managed Ethnikos Piraeus in Greece, Apollon Limassol in [[Cyprus]] and in [[Qatar]] (where he won the championship with Al Rayyan Sports Club). He managed Fulham for one season in 1990–91 having been initialled [[recruited]] to help manager Ray Lewington. It was his first job back in [[English]] football for over a decade. The team's performance was poor. They finished 21st in the league (a position which normally would have seen them relegated to Division Four, though they were saved from this fate thanks to league restructuring) and were eliminated from the FA Cup by non-league side Hayes. Things appeared to be going better in the following season, but a run of five successive defeats near the end of 1991 saw him sacked.

"In Greek mythology, Lepreus (Λεπρεύς) was a son of Caucon (Glaucon) or Pyrgeus, and grandson of Poseidon; one account calls him son of Poseidon. His mother was Astydameia, daughter of Phorbas. Lepreus once advised Augeas to cast Heracles in bonds, so that Augeas wouldn't have to keep his promise to reward Heracles for cleansing of his stables. Since then, Heracles hated Lepreus; but when he came to Caucon's house after [[completing]] his [[twelve]] labors, Astydameia insisted that he reconcile with her son. Lepreus then challenged Heracles to several friendly competitions, namely throwing a discus, drawing water, and seeing which of the two was the fastest eater, each having to consume a bull at a time.

"[[George]] Briscoe [[Kerferd]] ([[21]] January 1831 – [[31]] [[December]] [[1889]]), Australian colonial [[politician]], was the 10th Premier of Victoria. [[Kerferd]] was [[born]] in Liverpool, the son of G. B. [[Kerferd]], a merchant (or [[Joseph]] Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, née [[Blundell]]) [[Kerferd]] was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however [[circumstances]] led him to enter his father's [[business]]. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with [[plans]] to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his [[luck]] as a [[gold]] miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and [[wine]] [[merchant]]. He was mayor of Beechworth [[1863-64]] and [[three]] other [[occasions]]. In 1853 he [[married]] [[Ann]] Martindale, with whom he had ten children. [[Kerferd]] was [[admitted]] to the [[Melbourne]] [[bar]] in 1867 but did not practise as a [[lawyer]]. Kerferd was elected to the [[Legislative]] [[Assembly]] for the Ovens in [[November]] [[1864]], and represented the area [[continuously]] until [[February]] [[1886]]. He began [[studying]] [[law]] in 1864 and was [[Minister]] for [[Mines]] and Vice-President of the [[Board]] of [[Land]] and Works in the [[government]] of James McCulloch [[1868]], and [[Solicitor-General]] 1872-1874 and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in [[July]] [[1874]] [[Kerferd]] succeeded him at the head of a new [[conservative]] ministry. Kerferd's Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a [[convinced]] [[free]] trader, and the [[government's]] [[1875]] [[budget]] [[proposed]] repealing the [[tariffs]] imposed by Charles [[Gavan]] Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a [[land]] tax and a tax on beer and [[spirits]]. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August [[1875]]. Kerferd was again Attorney-General in [[later]] [[conservative]] [[governments]] (1875–[[1877]], 1880 and [[1883]]–86, in the Service [[government]]). In 1883 Kerferd was a [[Victorian]] representative to the [[federal]] convention. In 1886 he [[quit]] politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the [[Supreme]] Court of [[Victoria]]. The appointment was not [[without]] controversy as several barristers had served longer in the [[legal]] profession, but Kerferd did have eight years as attorney-general. There was general agreement that Kerferd filled his role as judge with great ability. Kerferd served as a judge until his death in 1889 while on holiday at Sorrento, Victoria.
