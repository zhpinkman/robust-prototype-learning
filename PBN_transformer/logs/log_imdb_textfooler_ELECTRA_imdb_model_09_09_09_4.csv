"One of the greatest lessons I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card.

A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts pans or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and delivered his next line. Julie Corman said ""I've seen enough."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot.

"A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />Make-up effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural [[slasher]] without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his ""dump in the woods"" scene and current unemployment status.","A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville.

"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it [[heals]] them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to [[hot]], [[raunchy]] [[blues]].<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways.

This movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies. Williams had recently shed his Mork and [[Kelli]] pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. Audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and [[unexplainable]] ending.",0.3301798105239868,0.5051020383834839,0,1,0,608,"Successful"

"Sharpe's [[Honour]] for the uninitiated, is the [[fifth]] entry in a [[series]] of TV movies [[focusing]] on an English army [[rifleman]] during the [[Napoleonic]] [[wars]] and [[based]] on the [[books]] by [[Bernard]] Cornwell (which I [[strongly]] [[recommend]] [[reading]]). [[If]] you were to [[start]] by watching this [[particular]] one [[though]], you'd [[get]] the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the [[rest]] of the [[army]] [[revolves]] around. Should that be the [[case]], I'd [[recommend]] starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the [[fragile]] British/Spanish alliance will start to crumble and things [[will]] turn around again. When the Spanish nobles [[come]] to [[Wellington]] [[crying]] for Sharpe's blood though, the [[English]] general is [[less]] than willing to hang his [[best]] soldier [[so]] fakes his [[death]] and [[soon]], he's off on a [[secret]] mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. [[Surprisingly]] enough for a Sharpe [[film]] as [[well]], there's a [[gorgeous]] woman to [[be]] rescued along the [[way]], [[fancy]] that.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />What this [[results]] in of [[course]] is a more adventure [[style]] [[approach]].

[[Furthermore]], Ducos [[makes]] a [[fantastic]] [[successor]] to [[Obadiah]] Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />[[In]] short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, ""Den Brysomme mannen"" [[makes]] normal human interaction look like deadpan [[comedy]], as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

And if you happen to still have a copy of ""AI Assault"" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. I can admire the thriftiness of these films. Every dollar really does show up on the screen!

"For me, [[reviewing]] movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. The reviews I've written thus far have been for films that I love, respect, and admire, and I have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. A life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. I only recently began reviewing films for the IMDB, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which I believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. However, the existence of films like ""Graduation Day"" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. Completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of [[unformed]] ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema.

These films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly [[strove]] to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and [[overall]] tone.

"WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of [[retirement]] from [[writing]] [[well]] [[deserved]] [[comments]] about [[horrible]] [[movies]]. [[Only]] the [[movie]] in [[titled]] ""Scarecrow [[gone]] [[wild]]"" could bring me back, [[so]] here I am.<br /><br />[[With]] that being [[said]], I [[like]] to [[start]] off with this [[comment]]. [[OUCH]]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [[This]] movie was really horrible, I mean I know it was going to be bad. But I [[had]] no idea that I would [[be]] [[spending]] 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what I thought was a horror [[movie]].<br /><br />Let's start with the biggest flaw of the film (to me that is). Ken Shamrock. Now if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. Now if [[memory]] serves me again, he was also in this [[stupid]] [[movie]] being a [[stupid]] comic relief (or that's how it looked to me). I mean how else [[do]] you [[explain]] all of his [[lines]]. My all [[time]] [[favorite]] [[line]] of his in this [[so]] [[called]] [[movie]] was ""It's been a [[long]] [[time]] [[coming]]"". OK????????? The funnest [[thing]] about that [[line]] was that no more then five minutes [[prior]] to him say that, he was [[sitting]] on the beach [[talking]] to the soon to [[be]] [[dead]] [[kids]] about how the [[dam]] scarecrow could not be [[killed]]. [[So]] if he [[has]] knowledge of this, why on earth would he [[start]] [[trying]] to [[combat]] it as [[soon]] as he [[sees]] it (the scarecrow that it). Like [[I]] [[said]] before, he must [[have]] been the comic [[relief]], except I don't [[think]] his [[UFC]] [[buddies]] where [[laughing]].<br /><br />[[Now]] that I've [[finished]] that [[well]] [[deserved]] [[paragraph]] on to the [[movie]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />I'll [[admit]] that [[I]] can't [[remember]] a [[lot]] of [[scenes]], and that's not [[good]] [[considering]] that I just [[watch]] the [[movie]] no more then fifteen minutes [[ago]]. [[So]] what I'm [[going]] to [[do]] is [[list]] the top five things [[wrong]] with this [[film]] 1. [[Usually]] when horror [[movie]] [[monster]] have their own theme [[music]], it's not [[heard]] by the [[victims]] or even by the monster itself. [[So]] why were just about [[every]] [[person]] [[involved]] in this [[movie]] [[able]] to here this [[pathetic]] whistling. I mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl [[running]] in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.","WEll first and for most I'd just like to say that I'm back out of [[pensions]] from [[written]] [[quite]] [[merits]] [[remark]] about [[monstrous]] [[scene]].

I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.",0.31527942419052124,0.5010167956352234,0,1,0,9161,"Successful"
"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression.

"[[After]] repeatedly [[saying]] how brilliant [[so]] [[many]] Columbo [[episodes]] are, it's time to [[honour]] an episode with maximum points.

Well here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. [[Alex]] has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the [[orchestra]] (not his first affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to [[leave]] his [[wife]], but as his wife's mother holds the purse [[strings]] for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his [[career]] and [[marriage]] overnight. [[Instead]] he [[hatches]] a plot to sneak out of the [[concert]] hall before a performance and murder his [[young]] [[lover]] while making it [[look]] like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for [[Columbo]] to connect Alex to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his [[man]], it [[actually]] [[takes]] quite a while and a [[few]] false [[leads]] (none of which [[Columbo]] [[really]] [[swallows]]) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the [[way]] there are some top-notch [[extra]] [[characters]], [[ranging]] from the [[precocious]] [[young]] [[neighbour]] of [[Jennifer]] [[Wells]] and the [[English]] [[mechanic]] who [[sounds]] [[like]] he would [[be]] more at [[home]] on Coronation [[Street]], through to the bedraggled [[looking]] [[brass]] [[player]] who [[nearly]] [[finds]] himself [[fitted]] up for the [[murder]] (he [[had]] also been [[seeing]] [[Jennifer]] Wells, the [[busy]] [[girl]]!).

Blythe is [[absolutely]] [[divine]] as [[Mrs]] Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this [[performance]] is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"[[A]] film that reveals the unease of [[modern]] [[men]] and [[women]] in [[life]] when [[confronted]] to death.

"*SPOILER ALERT!!

So me & my friend made plans to [[see]] it after school [[today]]. Boy, are we [[glad]] we [[did]]. [[The]] movie [[starts]] off in Italy, with a planned heist with a [[group]] of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also [[known]] as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll [[get]] the [[nickname]] later], [[Handsome]] Rob [Jason [[Statham]]], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & [[John]] Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 [[minutes]], and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year [[later]], where where Stella [[Bridger]] (Charlize [[Theron]]), John's [[daughter]], is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can [[ask]] for. Charlie Croker (who was [[actually]] indirectly [[responsible]] for her father's [[death]], as he [[called]] him out of [[retirement]] for the heist) [[says]] that they've [[found]] [[Steve]] (who [[has]] [[gone]] into [[hiding]]), and [[want]] to [[get]] back at him for what he [[did]]. [[She]] at first [[declines]], but [[later]] [[agrees]], and the teamgets back [[together]], along with [[getting]] the [[help]] of [[Wrench]] ([[Franky]] G), a [[mechanic]], to [[carry]] out the [[perfect]] heist, while creating one of the [[largest]] [[traffic]] jams in [[Los]] [[Angeles]] [[history]]. [[This]] movie is a [[perfect]] [[mix]] of action with [[funny]] [[bits]] thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a [[cameo]]) [[stole]] it while he fell asleep, and eventually [[Lyle]] will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a [[funny]] [[line]] in the [[movie]] by Seth, who [[goes]] ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his [[hair]], like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he [[stole]] it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only [[negative]] thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this [[movie]] due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

Don't just blame it on the budget- [[films]] can [[still]] [[be]] [[interesting]] without [[special]] [[effects]]. [[This]] wasn't. [[Christian]] [[films]] cannot [[excuse]] their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic [[sphere]] just [[because]] of their [[message]]. [[And]] the [[message]] here was [[hardly]] ""[[Christian]].""<br /><br />**Disclaimer: The rest of this [[comment]] is [[targeted]] towards Christians**<[[br]] /><[[br]] />First off, it is [[unethical]] in any [[business]] to bait-and-switch your [[customers]]. [[I]] don't like being [[told]] I can [[win]] a [[free]] iPod only to [[realize]] I have to [[spend]] $300 at [[participating]] [[stores]] first. Nonchristians don't like being [[told]] they're watching a Sci-Fi film and then get [[bombarded]] with Christian propaganda that [[has]] all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. <br /><br />Secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians came off as callous, smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical ""unbeliever""-- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. Representational dialogue: ""Turn to Jesus- OR GO TO HELL!"" ""Fine, don't believe me- BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY!"" ""The day you die, I can guarantee you'll [[wish]] you [[paid]] more attention to this Jesus stuff- WHEN YOU LAND IN THE BELLY OF HELL!"" OK, I may be exaggerating, but it certainly came off in the same manner. If you [[think]] this is a ""clear message for Christ,"" you're wrong. I don't recall Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please don't use this as a ""witnessing tool"" for your ""unsaved"" friends. It is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message.<br /><br />Thirdly, the theology was bad. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, it offered one pat answer: ""UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens,"" which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most Christians. As the Bible doesn't mention UFOs or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in Church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.<br /><br />Basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it.","[[me]] [[occurred]] across this [[films]] while channel-surfing and it [[occurred]] to [[represented]] yet another poorly- [[faites]] [[Christen]] [[flick]] about The [[Cessation]] [[Time]] (which I [[concludes]] [[acutely]] [[funniest]] because they [[carry]] themselves [[moreover]] [[sharply]]).

Don't just blame it on the budget- [[imagery]] can [[similarly]] [[arrive]] [[striking]] without [[alfred]] [[influences]]. [[These]] wasn't. [[Gospel]] [[movies]] cannot [[excused]] their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic [[scope]] just [[as]] of their [[communicating]]. [[Nor]] the [[messages]] here was [[purely]] ""[[Evangelical]].""<br /><br />**Disclaimer: The rest of this [[point]] is [[targets]] towards Christians**<[[brit]] /><[[ab]] />First off, it is [[deceitful]] in any [[commerce]] to bait-and-switch your [[user]]. [[me]] don't like being [[telling]] I can [[triumph]] a [[unrestrained]] iPod only to [[cognizant]] I have to [[earmarks]] $300 at [[partake]] [[storefront]] first. Nonchristians don't like being [[spoken]] they're watching a Sci-Fi film and then get [[shelling]] with Christian propaganda that [[holds]] all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. <br /><br />Secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians came off as callous, smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical ""unbeliever""-- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. Representational dialogue: ""Turn to Jesus- OR GO TO HELL!"" ""Fine, don't believe me- BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY!"" ""The day you die, I can guarantee you'll [[longings]] you [[reimbursed]] more attention to this Jesus stuff- WHEN YOU LAND IN THE BELLY OF HELL!"" OK, I may be exaggerating, but it certainly came off in the same manner. If you [[thinking]] this is a ""clear message for Christ,"" you're wrong. I don't recall Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please don't use this as a ""witnessing tool"" for your ""unsaved"" friends. It is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message.<br /><br />Thirdly, the theology was bad. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, it offered one pat answer: ""UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens,"" which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most Christians. As the Bible doesn't mention UFOs or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in Church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.<br /><br />Basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it.",0.28318196535110474,0.5008094310760498,0,1,0,2771,"Successful"

"CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the Sydney Opera House'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.","CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia.

"The first [[time]] I [[saw]] ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated [[Musical]] [[Comedy]]"", was in the [[early]] '80 in a Movie-Theater in N.Y. [[City]] with some friends. I [[remember]] we [[actually]] [[enjoyed]] it [[very]] [[much]], although we were [[left]] [[wondering]] why all the ""[[goodies]]"" were [[covered]] by in [[various]] [[forms]] [[shaped]] [[colored]] patches and why the [[movie]] was [[suddenly]] [[jumping]] from one [[scene]] to the next one, [[leaving]] [[us]] guessing...what we just [[missed]]. [[Obviously]] it was the soft-core [[edited]] (chopped) [[version]], which [[left]] me with the [[desire]] to [[watch]] it again [[soon]], but in its [[original]] integral [[version]]. [[Well]], more then 20 years [[went]] by, during which [[I]] [[forgot]] all about this movie and, only a [[few]] [[days]] ago, by sheer [[chance]], I [[stumbled]] upon a [[heavily]] used VHS [[copy]] (which [[had]] [[seen]] [[better]] times: a bit washed-out [[colors]], [[scratchy]] [[sound]] and a [[few]] [[flaws]]), but [[guess]] what? It's the [[original]] uncut [[version]] and, this [[time]], I [[really]] [[had]] a ball! Humor, [[Musical]] and Porn may [[sound]] an [[awkward]] [[combination]] but, in this case, it [[really]] works and, [[unlikely]] the [[big]] [[majority]] of [[boring]] porn-flicks nowadays invading our [[screens]], this is a [[really]] [[amusing]] and [[entertaining]] [[sex]] [[fantasy]], which [[will]] not disappoint you. [[The]] [[direction]] is [[clever]], the [[swift]] [[editing]] [[makes]] the [[movie]] [[fly]] like a [[bird]], all the familiar [[characters]] are [[lovable]] or just plain [[funny]], all the [[actors]] [[seem]] [[having]] a [[good]] [[time]], the songs are catchy (worth [[mentioning]] the one about ""[[growing]] up"" [[sung]] by Alice at the [[beginning]] of the [[movie]] and the [[hilarious]] ""What's a [[nice]] [[girl]] [[like]] you [[doing]] on a Knight like this""), the [[dance]] [[numbers]] are [[well]] [[choreographed]] and [[staged]] ([[amazingly]] [[energetic]] [[Terry]] [[Hall]] [[proves]] that she can ""also"" [[dance]] and [[dances]] [[enthusiastically]] her [[guts]] away...Don't [[worry]], she also [[does]] what she was [[best]] [[known]] for...), the [[acting]], the [[singing]], the [[set]], the [[costumes]] are of [[quality]] [[level]] and then...there is [[Kristine]] ""[[Blue]] [[Eyes]]"" DeBell, in the first starring role of her career and ([[oh]] [[boy]]!) she indeed [[has]] a [[few]] H.C.

[[so]] [[very]] [[pretty]]; with the [[help]] of her [[new]] friends in Wonderland, she [[discovers]] her [[body]] and her [[sexuality]] so, she sings, she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! [[The]] closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating [[smile]]) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of very good time (perhaps also an after-show extra action...) This is ""Adult Entertainment"" so be careful, don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. If your 10 years old can put his hands on it, he might amuse himself, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why ""this"" Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he [[watched]] on the Disney's video.

"I'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. How sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /><br />I had major problems with Jennifer Beals and her character. I found Alex extremely repellent. Beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with Alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. She also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. It is very difficult to believe that Nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. And what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />As for the dancing, I'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And even that famous final sequence is pretty [[disappointing]], especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). You could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when Alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true.

"Eisenstein's first sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian town seems a [[prophetic]] warning of the [[massacres]] of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. By the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more [[populist]] and [[palatable]] to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. Nevsky's [[strong]] point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is [[justly]] seen as a milestone in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a [[battle]] would [[be]] [[so]] vivid in the [[screen]]. Another [[strong]] point is Prokofiev's [[beautiful]], [[haunting]] soundtrack ([[using]] a composer to score a [[movie]] was [[completely]] [[unusual]] at the [[time]]).

It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape.

[[The]] [[zombies]] are hungry (for lifeforce, not flesh) and they're crazed and agile and terrifying. Not the slow [[moving]] [[bores]] of other zombie movies. Also, a lot of people have criticized the ending but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the lifeforce-drained victims.<br /><br />And to think this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s, when people flocked to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it bombed because it was way ahead of its time with its super nihilistic point of view!<br /><br />As for the DVD, well, it ain't great. The image is muddy and grainy and there are no extras whatsoever. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just [[hope]] that they'll release a clean, crisp U.S. version on a DVD, and with commentary by Hooper and Dykstra.","[[me]] [[subsequently]] got hold of Lifeforce on [[CD]] with the widescreen format [[spared]] and rousing [[Fredrik]] Mancini [[note]] to the [[topped]].

"[[The]] Golden [[Door]] is the story of a [[Sicilian]] family's [[journey]] from the [[Old]] [[World]] ([[Italy]]) to the [[New]] [[World]] ([[America]]). Salvatore, a middle-aged [[man]] who [[hopes]] for a more [[fruitful]] [[life]], [[persuades]] his [[family]] to [[leave]] their [[homeland]] behind in Sicily, [[take]] the [[arduous]] [[journey]] across the raging [[seas]], and inhabit a [[land]] whose rivers supposedly [[flow]] with [[milk]]. [[In]] short, they [[believe]] that by [[risking]] everything for the [[New]] [[World]] their [[dreams]] of [[prosperity]] [[will]] [[be]] [[fulfilled]]. [[The]] [[imagery]] of the [[New]] World is [[optimistic]], [[clever]] and [[highly]] [[imaginative]]. [[Silver]] coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he [[anticipates]] how [[prosperous]] he'll [[be]] in the New World; [[carrots]] and onions twice the size of human [[beings]] are [[shown]] being harvested to suggest [[wealth]] and [[health]], and [[rivers]] of [[milk]] are [[swam]] in and flow through the minds of those who [[anticipate]] what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the [[gritty]] realism that the story [[unfolds]] to the audience. [[The]] contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the New World.<[[br]] /><br />The voyage to the [[New]] [[World]] is [[shot]] almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas [[tempests]] roar and [[nearly]] kill the [[people]] within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the [[journey]] itself to the New World. The [[Old]] World is [[depicted]] as [[somewhat]] [[destitute]] and [[primitive]]. [[This]] is [[shown]] as [[Salvatore]] [[scrambles]] together to [[sell]] what [[few]] [[possessions]] he [[has]] [[left]] ([[donkeys]], [[goats]] and [[rabbits]]) in [[order]] to [[obtain]] the [[appropriate]] [[clothing]] he [[needs]] to [[enter]] the New [[World]]. I [[thought]] it was [[rather]] [[interesting]] that these [[people]] [[believed]] they [[had]] to [[conform]] to a [[certain]] dress [[code]] in [[order]] to [[be]] [[accepted]] in the [[New]] World; it was almost [[suggesting]] that [[people]] [[had]] to [[fit]] a [[particular]] [[stereotype]] or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most [[powerful]] image in the film was when the ship is [[leaving]] their homeland and setting sail for the New World. [[This]] [[shot]] shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This [[shot]] also suggested that the [[people]] were being torn away from all that was once familiar, [[wanted]] to divorce from their previous dark living [[conditions]] and were [[desirous]] to enter a [[world]] that held more promise.<br /><br />As later contrasted to how the [[New]] [[World]] [[visually]] [[looks]], the Old World seems [[dark]] and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct.

"Its almost embarrassing to say I even saw this movie.

Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.<br /><br />The dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as ""What do you do for a living?"" in response ""I kill zombies"" and ""I was never a disk jockey, I was a soldier."" The special effects are [[embarrassing]] even for a made for TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms.

I mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. Does House of the Dead 2 do any of these things right? No, not one. Of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from Uwe Bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.<br /><br />The dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as ""What do you do for a living?"" in response ""I kill zombies"" and ""I was never a disk jockey, I was a soldier."" The special effects are [[exasperating]] even for a made for TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. The army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. This movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms.

"Franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the ""earlies"" (often black and white and inventive), the ""naughties"" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving Soledad Miranda), the ""nudies"" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and ""the rest"".<br /><br />This is part of the ""rest"".

Some scenes (such as Knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to.

"[[The]] 1973 musical [[version]] of [[LOST]] [[HORIZON]] is the most [[wonderful]] endearing and campy [[musical]] [[films]] of [[ALL]] TIME. The 1973 [[musical]] remake of the [[James]] Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a [[real]] [[special]] [[gem]]. [[Music]] by BURT BACHARACH and [[lyrics]] by HAL David. A [[strange]] [[mixture]] of straight [[drama]], [[adventure]] and [[musical]] [[sequences]]. [[It]] [[has]] the distinction of being the [[ONLY]] [[anti]] [[war]] [[musical]] [[fantasy]] ever [[filmed]]. <[[br]] /><[[br]] />This [[film]] was a [[critical]] and [[financial]] [[disappointment]] in the United [[States]], but [[made]] a [[lot]] of money overseas. Only in [[America]] [[did]] it [[fail]]. [[Highly]] different and [[unique]] in it's [[approach]] as a [[film]] [[musical]], it deserves [[far]] [[better]] [[credit]] than it's [[given]]. As a [[story]], [[LOST]] [[HORIZON]] is an [[incredible]] adventure and both the 1937 [[Frank]] Capra [[film]] and this 1973 musical are [[faithful]] [[adaptations]] of the [[James]] [[Hilton]] [[novel]]. What [[I]] [[like]] about the 1973 [[version]] is the [[freedom]] in which the [[musical]] [[numbers]] are [[presented]]. The [[film]] [[has]] a [[prestigious]] [[cast]] and a [[gifted]] [[director]] and [[cinematographer]]. [[This]] is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a [[wonderful]] place. [[Songs]] [[like]] [[THE]] [[WORLD]] [[IS]] A [[CIRCLE]], [[SHARE]] [[THE]] [[JOY]] and LIVING [[TOGETHER]], [[GROWING]] [[TOGETHER]] evoke a [[happiness]] that Hilton [[wrote]] about in his [[novel]]. [[Why]] shouldn't Shangri-La [[be]] a [[slightly]] [[goofy]] [[place]]? The two [[love]] songs, [[I]] [[MIGHT]] FRIGHTEN [[HER]] [[AWAY]] and the [[deleted]] I [[COME]] [[TO]] [[YOU]] are the sensitive spots in the picture. There's a [[peacefulness]] and [[soft]] spoken quality in both these songs that is [[very]] [[much]] [[keeping]] with the [[philosophy]] of the story. [[Moreover]], [[THE]] [[THINGS]] [[I]] [[WILL]] [[NOT]] MISS is a [[good]] [[duet]] with a [[strong]] [[melody]]. It's a [[nice]] exchange of [[different]] [[types]] of perspective and who can fault with [[Olivia]] Hussey and Sally [[Kellerman]] [[stomping]], singing and [[dancing]] on [[tables]]? They're a [[wonderful]] team and the number is well staged. <br /><br />I always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, RICHARD ONWAY'S [[conflict]] with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in Shangri-La.<br /><br />Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /><br />LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. A lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.","[[Both]] 1973 musical [[impression]] of [[LOSSES]] [[HORIZONS]] is the most [[glamorous]] endearing and campy [[musician]] [[picture]] of [[ENTIRE]] TIME. The 1973 [[choral]] remake of the [[Jack]] Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a [[factual]] [[bizarre]] [[amethyst]]. [[Singer]] by BURT BACHARACH and [[chants]] by HAL David.

"A [[recent]] re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi [[Chez]] les Hommes'), with its [[famous]] 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now [[comes]] in the US in a [[gorgeous]] [[new]] [[print]] from The [[Criterion]] [[Collection]] with improved subtitles and some extras. Jules Dassin was an American ([[born]] [[Julius]] Dassin in Middletown Connecticut) who was [[forced]] to make films in Europe [[because]] he was Blacklisted. Rififi was well publicized in the US and did well in art houses. Later Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) starring his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again glamorized and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a big hit in Cairo.) The new Rififi [[DVD]] [[includes]] a recent interview with Dassin. I did not [[previously]] realize that one of the [[main]] [[robbers]], Cesar the Milanese, was [[played]] by Dassin, who stepped in when the [[original]] [[actor]] [[became]] [[unavailable]]. He's one of the most [[memorable]] [[characters]], a dandified Italian [[safe]] cracker who speaks no French.<br /><[[br]] />Although this [[classic]] [[has]] all the trappings of French film noir--the black and white twilight world of [[well]] lit [[apartments]], [[shiny]] [[black]] cars, men in suits, the nightclub [[scenes]], [[including]] a [[dramatically]] [[filmed]] and [[lit]] [[title]] song performed at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in [[hand]] or mouth--I don't think it's as atmospheric or has [[quite]] as distinctive a style as Melville's films do. But there's the mesmerizing robbery, which [[still]] holds up [[today]] as a [[tour]] [[de]] force. [[It]] [[goes]] like clockwork, with a [[fine]] [[sense]] of craft and [[teamwork]] among the robbers. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. Things quickly go wrong after they go home and [[distribute]] the loot when one of the [[players]] [[gets]] sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. [[Has]] there ever been a heist [[film]] whose perps lived [[happily]] ever after? <[[br]] /><[[br]] />It's the wordless [[heist]] [[sequence]] that [[guarantees]] this a [[special]] place, and Dassin, an American [[director]] who [[had]] an [[unusually]] [[varied]] and exotic [[career]], [[deserves]] [[full]] [[credit]] for that. [[He]] [[took]] a [[novel]] [[so]] [[conventional]] he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it [[pales]] [[compared]] to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.","A [[latest]] re-issue of the French crime film (original title 'Du Rififi [[Avec]] les Hommes'), with its [[notorious]] 20-minute silent jewel heist sequence, now [[happen]] in the US in a [[funky]] [[nouvelle]] [[copies]] from The [[Requirements]] [[Sample]] with improved subtitles and some extras.

However, having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable, as too much of a good thing just plain [[bores]].<br /><br />If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem, then yes, in fact those scenes are just that. There are no details, and everything is seen from afar, in a God-like mode. Things happen just like that on screen, with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close. It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings, and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act. Morbid as it might sound, show us the victims! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count, not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale.<br /><br />Trying to weave a romance into the movie, it stood out like a sore thumb. There are many characters in the movie, but each one of them lacking real characteristics, or humanity, and look like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion, and definitely very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements, instructions and form policies, and react to incidents like it was a computer game, all settled with a push of a button. These are characters that you don't give a hoot about.<br /><br />If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are terrific effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views. And infused within are plenty of action sequences, big ones like the disasters themselves, and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit, that makes it relatively compelling.<br /><br />Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan, this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff.","This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on a novel by Sakyo [[Kubota]].

Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance.

Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot. Moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave. The twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt, but this might(..or might not)work considering how the story plays out regarding why Ramón's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior. I will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail, but as a slasher flick, it's a breath of fresh air.",0.10466551780700684,0.5032356381416321,1,0,1,1305,"Successful"
"Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage.

[[He]] manhandles [[Ann]], [[snaps]] at [[witnesses]], short-shrifts [[clients]] - just the [[kind]] of [[lawyer]] who [[gives]] his [[profession]] a [[bad]] [[name]].

""I forgave you that!"" she [[says]], as if it was [[big]] of her.<br /><[[br]] />[[For]] David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little [[illicit]] pleasure with his ""[[mistress]]"" before tying the knot for good. [[For]] Ann, it's an attempt at premarital [[sex]] that must be repelled with a [[bottle]] of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life.<br /><br />The acorn doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what David tried to pull: ""Oh my poor baby! Thank Heaven your father is dead!""<br /><br />That's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable [[comedy]].<br /><br />You can call this an example of the ""remarriage comedy"", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an [[example]] of what Roger Ebert calls the ""idiot plot"", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight American morality, but can't really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing.<br /><br />Lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. What a shame it couldn't have been something better! She was overbearing in ""My Man Godfrey"", too, but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her, you wanted to. Here she plays for laughs that aren't there while sadistically breaking David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like Groucho, a study in smugitude.<br /><br />The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer, who makes a play for Ann and acts with honor and decency.

"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist [[movement]]. [[During]] the next 2 or 3 [[decades]] that [[followed]], France's New Wavers caught everyone's [[attention]], and there was [[always]] [[Bergman]] up there on his desolate [[Scandinavian]] [[island]] somewhere, [[making]] [[bitter]] masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti [[brought]] the art-form to [[full]] [[circle]], geographically [[speaking]], with his [[miraculous]] [[work]] *[[Death]] in Venice*, which [[might]] as [[well]] [[be]] called *The [[Death]] of Europoean Cinema*. [[After]] the Sixties wound down, so [[did]] the [[great]] European [[filmmakers]], who, with some [[exceptions]], [[generally]] [[grew]] exhausted and passed the [[torch]] to a [[new]] [[American]] generation of [[Movie]] Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & [[Co]].). [[This]] movie [[absolutely]] [[feels]] [[like]] a [[grand]] summing-up, not just of Visconti's [[particular]] obsessions, but of the general [[attempt]] of European [[filmmakers]] to [[achieve]] the [[aesthetic]] [[ideal]] in [[movies]]. And rest [[assured]], you will [[find]] no sterner task-master than the Visconti [[revealed]] here. He's not [[playing]] to the [[crowd]], [[folks]]: either you [[get]] behind him and [[follow]] along, or you [[get]] [[left]] behind. The pacing is a [[challenge]]: [[slow]], but never without [[emotional]] [[weight]]. ""[[Incidents]]"" are [[few]] and [[far]] between, but [[each]] [[seems]] [[loaded]] with symbolic [[significance]] in a sturm-und-drang [[cosmos]].<br /><[[br]] />We [[will]] [[probably]] never be in such rarefied company again, in [[terms]] of the [[movies]]: one of the century's great writers who [[inspired]] the [[tale]] ([[Thomas]] [[Mann]]), one of the [[greatest]] [[filmmakers]] [[directing]] it (Visconti), one of the [[greatest]] [[actors]] in the [[lead]] [[role]] ([[Dirk]] Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, [[Gustav]] Mahler's 5th [[Symphony]]. [[Taking]] [[full]] advantage of Mahler's [[ability]] to [[inspire]] Romanticism in even the most [[cynical]] [[breast]], Visconti [[changes]] the [[main]] [[character]], Aschenbach, into a decrepit [[composer]] from his [[original]] [[persona]] as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, [[delivers]] what is probably greatest [[performance]] of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent [[performance]], and the actor has to [[deliver]] reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture.

It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />","Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist [[moving]]. [[About]] the next 2 or 3 [[olds]] that [[oversight]], France's New Wavers caught everyone's [[significance]], and there was [[periodically]] [[Ingrid]] up there on his desolate [[Swedish]] [[ile]] somewhere, [[bringing]] [[sour]] masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti [[been]] the art-form to [[utterly]] [[rings]], geographically [[discussed]], with his [[hallucinogenic]] [[endeavors]] *[[Murdered]] in Venice*, which [[chance]] as [[adequately]] [[happen]] called *The [[Homicides]] of Europoean Cinema*. [[Upon]] the Sixties wound down, so [[been]] the [[admirable]] European [[actresses]], who, with some [[reliefs]], [[principally]] [[growth]] exhausted and passed the [[lantern]] to a [[newer]] [[Latin]] generation of [[Films]] Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & [[Capt]].). [[These]] movie [[flatly]] [[smells]] [[amateur]] a [[tall]] summing-up, not just of Visconti's [[weird]] obsessions, but of the general [[tempting]] of European [[writers]] to [[make]] the [[cosmetic]] [[desirable]] in [[filmmaking]]. And rest [[ensured]], you will [[believes]] no sterner task-master than the Visconti [[uncovering]] here. He's not [[plays]] to the [[multitude]], [[grooms]]: either you [[getting]] behind him and [[surveilling]] along, or you [[getting]] [[letting]] behind. The pacing is a [[defiance]]: [[slack]], but never without [[witty]] [[weighing]]. ""[[Crash]]"" are [[scarce]] and [[immeasurably]] between, but [[any]] [[appear]] [[entrusted]] with symbolic [[value]] in a sturm-und-drang [[world]].<br /><[[brit]] />We [[go]] [[unlikely]] never be in such rarefied company again, in [[provision]] of the [[filmmakers]]: one of the century's great writers who [[grounded]] the [[narratives]] ([[Rushes]] [[Boyfriend]]), one of the [[greater]] [[cinematography]] [[guides]] it (Visconti), one of the [[superior]] [[actresses]] in the [[guiding]] [[traits]] ([[Andrei]] Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, [[Johann]] Mahler's 5th [[Beethoven]]. [[Took]] [[thorough]] advantage of Mahler's [[capacity]] to [[motivated]] Romanticism in even the most [[ruthless]] [[suck]], Visconti [[modifications]] the [[principal]] [[properties]], Aschenbach, into a decrepit [[composing]] from his [[prime]] [[nobody]] as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, [[stipulates]] what is probably greatest [[outcome]] of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent [[results]], and the actor has to [[supply]] reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie.

"It's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired. I haven't actually watched it seriously or closely in about 10 years. Now that I'm an adult in my 30s I can look back with a serious eye as I watch the episodes again.<br /><br />In concept, the cartoon is partly an [[homage]] to the [[classic]] Looney Tunes but also its [[own]] [[original]] show. There are a few [[episodes]] that are [[structured]] like the [[old]] [[cartoons]]. [[For]] [[example]], there is a [[singer]] that [[attacks]] Buster and [[so]] he exacts [[revenge]] on this singer's [[concert]] -[[exactly]] like the [[old]] [[Bugs]] [[Bunny]] [[cartoon]]. The [[ensuing]] [[cartoon]] is [[similar]] to [[Looney]] [[Tunes]], just in a [[different]] [[era]]. [[If]] you [[look]] at the [[old]] Looney Tunes, they [[did]] an [[awful]] [[lot]] of [[stuff]] [[exactly]] like Tiny Toons [[did]]. [[The]] [[old]] [[Looney]] [[Tunes]] [[made]] a [[lot]] of [[social]] [[commentary]] and [[parody]]. There were [[celebrity]] [[impersonations]]. There were a [[lot]] of [[corny]] [[period]] [[jokes]], [[slang]], and [[dialog]]. The [[comedy]] was [[surreal]] and [[wacky]]. You can say this [[exactly]] for Tiny Toons as [[well]]. [[The]] [[comedy]] [[styling]] is 'spiritually' the same. [[Most]] [[definitely]] a [[throwback]] to the classics which hadn't been [[done]] [[well]] (if at all) in [[cartoons]] in the decades [[prior]] to this [[show]]. [[We]] [[recognize]] the cultural [[references]] in [[Tiny]] Toons and we can [[roll]] our [[eyes]] when something we don't like [[comes]] up. But the [[reason]] we don't [[think]] Looney [[Tunes]] are [[corny]] is [[because]] we weren't [[alive]] back in the 40s. [[Also]], Looney [[Tunes]] was [[original]] back in those [[days]] but [[today]] [[cartoons]] are rehashed over and over. [[So]] it's [[easy]] to [[perceive]] [[Tiny]] Toons in an [[unfair]] [[light]] due to our exposure to [[current]] events and our overexposure to cartoons in general.<br /><[[br]] />There [[certainly]] are [[differences]] in many respects - the timing, the delivery, and [[obviously]] the [[duration]] of the shows. They are two different styles from two different periods, being done under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being made for kids watching TV. [[Even]] [[so]], they [[did]] a good [[job]] making an original show with original gags AND still paying [[homage]] to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the old Looney Tunes.<br /><br />[[Since]] Tiny Toons [[had]] a lot more [[time]] to [[play]] with, they [[had]] some [[genuine]] [[moments]] of [[great]] animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.","It's now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon first aired.

"In the aftermath of September 11th in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. Of course, in the present day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan.

"I give ""Flashdance"" a lowest rating of 1 out of 10 because it's nothing more than a series of music videos with a movie short surrounding the music videos, in order to clock in as a feature length film.

Meanwhile, at night she works as an exotic dancer, who never actually takes off her clothes, in a greasy spoon bar called Mawby's.

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.","If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd.

"This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as ""The Deer Hunter."") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being ""the perfect wife"" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, ""I'm going to bust that marriage up!"" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.","This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema. Recently, it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even-handed representation of soldiers' integration into post-war life ever made (and that most definitely includes films such as ""The Deer Hunter."") I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being ""the perfect wife"" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, ""I'm going to bust that marriage up!"" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps.

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in it's path as construction of the new Delta City continues and a new menace to contend with in the shape of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of Christ-likeness, peddling a deadly new addictive on the streets called nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.<br /><br />The original Robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those films that just can't be done again. That said, it's not surprising a sequel was made- it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original.

As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life haunting him, the tin plated hero sets out to bring this villain down- only to wind up getting chopped into pieces of scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP business-woman proposes plans for her new android- a stomping, snarling beast of a machine that needs an equally nasty test subject to power it- which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain.<br /><br />The original Robocop is a film that always manages to astound you each time you watch it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those films that just can't be done again. That said, it's not surprising a sequel was made- it's even less surprising that that sequel really pales compared to the original.

"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it [[rates]] on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The [[clever]] [[title]] has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. [[Whatever]] the case, it is a [[catchy]] title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by [[Lani]] Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, [[Connery]] more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's [[best]], and most [[relaxed]], turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence.

"After watching Ingmar Bergman's Skammen, I had many feelings, but most notably, I felt unsatisfied. I have heard so much hype about this movie but I came to find it lacking.

I found the characters to be disagreeable and unrealistic, which detracted from the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was fake led me to feel that the emotion was not real.

Towers then finds some obscure munich based prod. house, Tandem communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix it all up with no script whatsoever and you'll get ""Sumuru"" - a priceless gem among the [[finest]] [[filmmaking]] ever done! Get a live people, and do something else, whatever you do, no movies please!! To top everything, producers went to South Africa for filming, what you see on screen is one giant sand hole, where the ""action"" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better.",0.20209366083145142,0.6381187438964844,0,1,0,130,"Successful"

"One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place. An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women. I believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations, separations and misunderstandings, and still being able to bond and rely on each other. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed ""dead"" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stresses that this has most likely caused in their family, each one of them still embraces the mother without care for what she has donethat is, killing her husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as ones who not only love each other independent of character acts, but also ones who don't seem bothered in the least by the acts in which their friends/family members perform.<br /><br />Another idea that I thought was intriguing of this culture was in regards to their idea of the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and her inexplicable return, the director builds the audience's emotions to believe that this film is going to embody the supernatural. The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is to say, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe the rumors of the dead coming back to family members to finish the ""unfinished business."" I believed this was a mixed reflection of the culture's religious faith (predominantly Catholic) as well as their need to make amends with those who had no chance to be forgiven during mortality. The belief they held in regards to the dead being ""alive"" was also to give hope to the destitute circumstances they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film isn't supernatural at all, it's interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play. She's treated as if she still is a ghost (i.e. hiding in small crevices (underneath the bed or inside a car trunk)). I believe the director portrayed the mother this way to heighten the already existent supernatural beliefs the city had adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-held belief in life after death.","One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place.

"This film looks great, and that's about where my praise ends.

"Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Kind of. Well, it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess in that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />Let me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. In prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the [[greatest]] [[celebrity]] feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the [[thug]] life for real, and Ja Rule.

He's [[sentenced]] to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. [[Nothing]] else in the [[movie]] matters after that, it becomes a [[meaningless]] [[string]] of action sequences, most of which aren't even [[well]] [[choreographed]].<br /><[[br]] />[[Oh]], how about this, a [[helicopter]] [[crashes]] through the [[roof]] of ""[[New]] Alcatraz"" at one [[point]], [[accidentally]] [[freeing]] all of the inmates. [[And]] what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<br /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to [[go]], guys.","Yeah, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction.

Those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine, this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug, contented look about him. He'll make those Americans pay, oh yes indeed!<br /><br />But He didn't reckon on Doug Masters, the captured pilots 16-year-old son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car, (which can't be that long) and decides to fly into that evil, foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, retired pilot Chappy' Sinclair, Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. <br /><br />Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail, but you'd be wrong. Sure, those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots, but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery, Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably, the evil, not quite so smug anymore, dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself, in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky.

"That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever.

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it [[much]] either, and she'd never read the book). [[In]] this [[movie]] they [[managed]] to sap all the [[charm]] from the [[book]] and [[turn]] it into [[dull]] [[mush]]. A [[big]] [[part]] of the problem was [[William]] H. Macy. I [[like]] him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big [[part]] of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the [[police]]. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love [[Adam]] Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.","When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited.

"Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film.

At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings (Mind games?

"[[This]] is a movie that [[will]] [[leave]] you [[thinking]], is he or isn't he? [[While]] [[many]] [[people]] [[have]] [[complained]] about the [[ambiguous]] [[ending]], it [[gives]] [[room]] for the [[audience]] to [[think]] and [[interpret]] it from the [[signs]]. [[This]] is my [[interpretation]] and [[theory]], and [[I]] [[believe]] it is [[very]] [[sound]]. <[[br]] /><br />[[First]], here is the [[plot]].

[[After]] [[attempting]] to [[help]] a [[woman]] from muggers, he is [[arrested]] and [[sent]] to [[Bellevue]], and [[later]] [[transferred]] to [[Dr]]. [[Mark]] Powell's (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward. He befriends the other [[patients]] and [[quickly]] convinces them of his [[story]]. In [[fact]], he [[tells]] them he can take one [[person]] back with him. [[Soon]] Dr. Powell is [[beginning]] to question Prot's [[insanity]] and as the plot progresses, it is [[harder]] and harder to [[prove]] Prot wrong. <br /><[[br]] />[[In]] the end, Dr. Powell [[learns]] that Prot is [[Robert]] Porter, a smart [[man]] who [[worked]] in a slaughter [[house]] in [[New]] [[Mexico]], when his [[wife]] and [[daughter]] were [[murdered]]. Prot [[claims]] that he [[plans]] to [[leave]] for K-Pax at a [[precise]] time on the [[fifth]] [[anniversary]] of the [[murders]]. The [[time]] [[comes]] and [[goes]], and Powell [[finds]] Prot or Robert in a catatonic [[state]]. One of the [[patients]] is [[missing]] and is never [[found]] again. <[[br]] /><br />On to my [[theory]]: Prot is not [[crazy]]. Prot is from the [[planet]] K-Pax. [[Robert]] Porter is a [[friend]] of Prot's. [[On]] one of Prot's [[previous]] [[visits]] to Earth, Robert was a [[child]], [[learning]] about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert [[became]] [[best]] friends. After the [[death]] of his [[family]], and [[Robert]] slaying the [[murderer]], [[Robert]] [[decides]] to commit suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he [[rushes]] back (in multiples of light speed) to stop [[Robert]]. So Prot takes over the [[thinking]] of Robert, [[taking]] over his [[body]] so to [[speak]]. Awhile later, Prot (still inhabiting Robert's body) comes to New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. Take care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's [[daughter]] from that [[horrible]] fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. [[He]] is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too [[many]] plot holes.","[[These]] is a movie that [[dedication]] [[abandoning]] you [[concept]], is he or isn't he?

Shame on the person who did wardrobe for this film! Don't get me wrong -- all the outfits in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for the time period. It almost makes me wonder if they told the wardrobe person that it was a period piece.<br /><br />Bottom line -- good for a laugh or to feed a Jennie Garth fix. :)",0.3210451006889343,0.5075246095657349,0,1,0,842,"Successful"

"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, ""Look at me, I am so pretty!"" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much acting in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere.

The [[original]] version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much better actors.

So how can all those [[skeletons]] [[be]] in the pit?

And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music.

"With Nurse Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the [[Company]] of Men, [[Your]] Friends & Neighbors) makes his [[breakthrough]] into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as [[opposed]] to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and yet remains true to his [[roots]]. While his [[cast]] is now composed of A-list Hollywood [[names]] ([[Renee]] Zellweger, Morgan [[Freeman]], and stand-up [[comedian]] [[Chris]] [[Rock]]), his material [[remains]] just as [[bizarre]] and [[quirky]] as his first [[two]] features, proving that he just may be the next big [[thing]]. Nurse Betty is one of the [[darkest]] comedies to be advertised towards a mainstream audience in years, and considering its [[moderate]] box office and critical [[success]], [[perhaps]] moviegoers weren't as [[dumb]] and [[brainwashed]] as we though they were. The [[story]] [[follows]] (both [[figuratively]] [[AND]] literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg [[Kinnear]]) but is trapped in a loveless [[marriage]] to a [[slimy]] car dealer ([[Aaron]] Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in [[Company]]). When her [[husband]] is gruesomely [[murdered]] by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's [[sent]] into shock and obliviously sets out for Hollywood to [[meet]] her [[object]] of [[affection]] -- unaware that he's only an [[actor]]. When Freeman and [[Rock]] [[discover]] that the car she [[took]] contains 10 [[kilos]] of cocaine, they [[hit]] the [[road]] as [[well]] and outrageousness [[ensues]].

In Betty, a [[vulnerable]] [[housewife]] is unaware that the [[man]] she's chasing [[thinks]] her [[genuine]] [[adoration]] is nothing more than a joke. Some [[might]] [[begin]] to wonder if LaBute is [[really]] some [[sort]] of misogynist himself -- considering that his [[recurring]] [[theme]] [[involves]] the [[downfall]] of innocent [[women]]. But [[personally]], I [[think]] he's [[coming]] to the [[defense]] of the fair sex and [[dealing]] [[far]] more harshly with the [[abusers]] in his [[pictures]] than the [[abused]]. One of the many [[charms]] of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall [[obsessively]] for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C.

You could argue that the ending is a [[little]] too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint.

The other male lead looked like he just walked off the set of a Soap Opera and coasted by using the patented dimpled-smile-makes-all-the-ladies-swoon technique, which is the PG-13 gender-switch equivalent to my-large-breasts-make-all-the-guys-swoon technique often used by ladies in R-rated films.

"Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player ""Jimmy"" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns along the way between these two, as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. She is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and in no position to care for him. Natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times; she makes some odd phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. Natalie tries to dump Jimmy several times, only to have him re-enter her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends Natalie. You get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly, and it does. This film is certainly uneven at times, and the script is somewhat lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing ""The Godfather."" The actors are good ones, needless to say, as they all would have futures ahead of them in film. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underrated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is an early movie of Coppola's, and I confess I had never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience.","Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969.

"""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"". Cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a sort of ""Folk Hero"" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.<br /><br />My primary problem with ""ODC"" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a good job portraying Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /><br />The film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script.

[[Francois]] Périer is [[adequate]] also as a [[inconclusive]] [[nightclub]] [[tenant]], while the [[authentic]] standout [[efficacy]] [[is]] from [[Andrey]] Bourvil in his role as the police [[commissioners]]. The film runs at almost two and a half hours and is not [[adequately]] a thrill ride. However, the [[administrators]] [[remained]] things interesting by keeping the action focused on the [[imperative]] elements. [[Both]] [[photographed]] [[am]] feature [[indictment]] [[filmmakers]] stapes such as shootings, but they are [[canned]] to a [[slightest]]. The first [[three]] thirds of the [[theaters]] are [[clearly]] just building up to the suspenseful heist scene towards the end. Rififi was most [[prestigious]] for its heist sequence - an intricately designed scene in which nobody speaks a word. The heist in this film is similar in that it is also wordless, and I have to say that I preferred the scene in Rififi; but Melville's skill in direction and the [[placate]] and composed way that it plays out make good of it. The film boils down to an exciting climax that rounds it all off [[meekly]]. [[General]], this [[perils]] not [[recourse]] to all crime film fans as the action is more than a little bit slow; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.",0.09900158643722534,0.5151450634002686,1,0,1,3561,"Successful"

"Barry Champlain is a radio phone-in talk-show host in Dallas, whose no-holds-barred ideas on a plethora of social issues disturb and offend many of his callers and listeners.

"Frank Tashlin's 'Censored' is a so-so Private Snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the Censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. Snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the South Pacific but the Censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the unseen Censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a [[disappointing]] only-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! Aimed at the military, the Snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic I've come across in any of these shorts thus far. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin's 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'.

"Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for [[telemarketing]] individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer [[Gabriella]] Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me?

[[For]] a start I [[think]] Jacqueline Hyde was/is [[intended]] to [[be]] a [[horror]] [[film]], the IMDb [[certainly]] [[lists]] it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all [[apart]] from just how [[bad]] it is. [[I]] would [[say]] that [[Jacqueline]] Hyde is more a soft-core [[porno]] than anything else & [[extremely]] tame with it, why [[sit]] down & [[watch]] this [[softer]] than [[soft]] [[porno]] [[crap]] when you can watch you [[proper]] hard-core [[stuff]] that [[actually]] [[delivers]] the goods? Why, that's the [[question]] I [[ask]] here. It's not even [[good]] porn either, besides being [[far]] too [[soft]] it's [[dull]], boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the [[fact]] that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb's [[plot]] [[summary]] it [[sounds]] a [[hell]] of a [[lot]] [[better]] than this [[piece]] of [[rubbish]]. [[This]] is one of those [[films]] you [[have]] to [[watch]] yourself to [[see]] just how [[bad]] it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but [[maybe]] if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of.

"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. The writer/director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />Lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical ""last big night"" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go off to college. One thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There's a disposition of time, like in Nick Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. ""More American Graffiti"" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) off in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. Instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on New Years Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to become confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.<br /><br />The best parts of the movie to me are the ones with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. A good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. It was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why Curt isn't in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There's a black kind of satire to some of the Vietnam stuff, very similar to what I would imagine Lucas and John Milius' original idea for ""Apocalypse Now"" would have been like. And there's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. It just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and so many better films.<br /><br />Like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are great, and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see -- I wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? I couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I guess I have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as I remember it being. It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of ""American Graffiti"" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as ""American Graffiti"" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.","I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be.

"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.<br /><br />I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.<br /><br />Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an [[admirable]] [[successor]] to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />Characters are similarly hammered [[home]], particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying.

As Lynch [[enthusiasts]] [[know]], his is a [[style]] and vision [[uniquely]] [[blended]] from [[film]] [[noir]], [[horror]] [[movies]], surrealism, and [[parapsychology]]  with a [[healthy]] [[dose]] of [[postmodern]] self-consciousness and [[black]] [[humor]] [[thrown]] in for [[good]] measure.

Their [[seemingly]] random initial meeting occurs after the film's [[opening]] [[scene]], in which Harring's [[character]] [[escapes]] an [[attempt]] on her [[life]] [[thanks]] to a [[fortuitous]], not to mention horrific, [[automobile]] [[accident]].

Unable to [[remember]] her [[own]] [[name]], the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that [[adorns]] Aunt Ruth's apartment. ([[Actually]], it turns out Aunt Ruth [[has]] long since deceased and whose [[apartment]] we're [[really]] in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.)

As Lynch [[followers]] [[understand]], his is a [[format]] and vision [[separately]] [[merging]] from [[filmmakers]] [[ebony]], [[fear]] [[video]], surrealism, and [[telepathy]]  with a [[reasonable]] [[intake]] of [[allegory]] self-consciousness and [[ebony]] [[laugh]] [[introduced]] in for [[beneficial]] measure. [[Each]] these [[thing]] are [[thoughtfully]] at work in 'Mulholland [[Walk]],' [[having]] for a riveting, hair-raising, and [[infinitely]] satisfying film experience  [[mostly]] if one does not become overly obsessed with [[tends]] to make all the plot pieces [[tuning]] into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.<br /><br />The [[video]] [[role]] wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their [[probably]] random initial meeting occurs after the film's [[overture]] [[scenario]], in which Harring's [[digits]] [[fleeing]] an [[intention]] on her [[residing]] [[recognise]] to a [[casual]], not to mention horrific, [[engines]] [[injury]]. Staggering down the [[slopes]] from Mulholland [[Drives]] to [[Twilight]] Boulevard (the [[three]] most [[antithesis]] of Hollywood thoroughfares), she [[found]] her way to the [[too]] [[bedroom]] that [[Beatty]] (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her '[[Nana]] [[Greenberg]],' a purportedly [[positive]] [[actor]] who is off to [[Ontario]] to [[initiation]] a [[latest]] [[flick]]. [[Because]] we [[next]] [[learns]], Betty [[have]] herself [[arrives]] from [[Rooted]] [[Rio]], [[Canadians]], [[prematurely]] after [[won]] a jitterbug [[eurovision]].<[[brit]] /><br />A highly [[active]] and [[slender]] [[newsflash]] to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that [[marko]] Betty's [[predecessors]] from the [[prosaic]] would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the [[gluttonous]] madness of spurned [[amateur]] and going nowhere bit-part [[choreographer]]. Unable to [[recollect]] her [[especial]] [[nouns]], the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that [[adornments]] Aunt Ruth's apartment. ([[Really]], it turns out Aunt Ruth [[is]] long since deceased and whose [[condominiums]] we're [[genuinely]] in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.)

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather [[absurd]] depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final film is a letdown.","Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.

"[[The]] [[original]] Female [[Convict]] Scorpion is an all [[time]] masterpiece.

[[The]] plot [[structure]] for this [[film]] is [[similar]] to the other [[two]] in that it all builds into a crescendo of [[revenge]]. There are more [[people]] who have [[angered]] Scorpion in this [[film]] than in the [[previous]] two [[so]] this [[section]] [[takes]] up a [[fairly]] large [[part]] of the [[film]]. There's a [[few]] surreal [[sequences]], not as many as in the first [[film]] and nowhere [[near]] as in the second, but the [[film]] stays in with the [[rest]] of the [[series]] on that [[point]].

And that's just what [[director]] [[Anthony]] Asquith [[provided]] the British with 1943's [[naval]] [[war]] [[film]], [[We]] [[Dive]] at [[Dawn]]. After more than 60 [[years]], it's not [[surprising]] that some of the [[movie]] is [[dated]]. It doesn't help that the [[class]] stereotypes which [[help]] [[define]] the [[enlisted]] [[men]] from the [[officers]] can [[be]] jarring.

[[In]] this movie, [[Freddie]] Taylor (John Mills), the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger, is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in control, good with his men, humorous with his peers, [[quick]] to make a decision. And it helps that he's lucky. His men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave, after that things get tense quickly. <br /><br />Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg, a new German battleship. They just miss the ship when it [[enters]] the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it, through mine [[fields]], anti-sub [[nets]] and with a [[real]] [[risk]] of not [[having]] enough [[fuel]] to [[return]] to home base. [[After]] [[several]] [[tense]] [[situations]], the [[confrontation]] [[takes]] [[place]]. The [[Sea]] [[Tiger]] [[lets]] loose six torpedoes but [[has]] to [[dive]], not [[knowing]] if it [[had]] [[done]] its [[job]]. [[After]] a [[clever]] subterfuge, Taylor outfoxes a [[couple]] of [[German]] [[destroyers]] but then [[realizes]] there is not enough [[fuel]]. [[He]] [[plans]] to scuttle his sub and surrender when, just at the [[last]] [[moment]], [[James]] Hobson (Eric Portman), a [[seaman]] who had been sullen and a loner and who [[speaks]] German, [[says]] there is a [[small]] [[Danish]] [[coastal]] [[village]] that had been a [[fuel]] [[depot]]. He [[thinks]] it [[might]] [[still]] [[be]] for the [[Germans]]. The last [[third]] of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.","[[Unless]] you're in the [[midst]] of a [[pitched]] [[fight]] and it's [[increasingly]] not [[conspicuous]] that you're [[leave]] to [[happened]] out on [[principal]], among the [[point]] you'll [[become]] [[implicated]] with is to [[keeps]] up the [[morals]] of the [[civic]]...to [[demonstrating]] that our troops have the [[courage]], the resourcefulness and the [[promises]] to [[overcoming]] all the odds in a noble [[generate]].

[[Unless]] a [[wise]] subterfuge, Taylor outfoxes a [[hitch]] of [[Bavarian]] [[warships]] but then [[confesses]] there is not enough [[essence]]. [[His]] [[arrangements]] to scuttle his sub and surrender when, just at the [[previous]] [[juncture]], [[Terence]] Hobson (Eric Portman), a [[navy]] who had been sullen and a loner and who [[spoke]] German, [[asserted]] there is a [[scant]] [[Kroner]] [[waterfront]] [[town]] that had been a [[refilling]] [[file]]. He [[suppose]] it [[may]] [[incidentally]] [[pose]] for the [[Germania]]. The last [[thirdly]] of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.",0.10607254505157471,0.5002794861793518,1,0,1,9148,"Successful"

The filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart, scary, original movie, and it's a shame that they failed so miserably.

It actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore, scarier. That's the reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />The sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws, ""Rise of the Undead"" [[ai]] not insult your intelligence. The filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart, scary, original movie, and it's a shame that they failed so miserably. If they could just forego the too-fancy editing, buy a few extra lightbulbs, crank up the dialogue, and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to make something really good.<br /><br />Trust me: do not waste your time on ""Rise of the Undead.""",0.29537707567214966,0.5026968121528625,0,1,0,3942,"Successful"

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most [[stylish]] people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. [[Everything]] in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], [[starting]] with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny [[Arcade]] who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. [[Nixon]] is a [[persuasive]] and gifted performer but is given no [[chance]] by the script to [[embody]] the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a [[sterile]], unreal [[look]] with no sense of the [[period]]. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the [[title]] role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.","One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no.

True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. [[Together]] in the infrastructure of this film is [[deceptive]], [[launching]] with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure painter of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny [[Archie]] who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. [[Woodrow]] is a [[improbable]] and gifted performer but is given no [[odds]] by the script to [[symbolizes]] the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a [[barren]], unreal [[seem]] with no sense of the [[days]]. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the [[appoint]] role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.",0.29850661754608154,0.5478584170341492,0,1,0,607,"Successful"

"I gave ""Airport '79"" only two stars because it's a truly [[lousy]] film. Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) This is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />A'79 really does seem like an early version of ""Airplane!"" Every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's truly funny.<br /><br />And I'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />[[In]] summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit [[amusing]].

The [[moderate]] [[revolutionary]] Danton [[has]] [[returned]] to Paris from his [[country]] [[seat]] where he [[has]] been [[since]] being [[deposed]] as [[leader]] of the [[Committee]] of [[Public]] Safety in the [[previous]] [[year]] by Robespierre.

The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow.

Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll.

"Though some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the connection of learning frequency, and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention, there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of Sean Connery in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy.

"OK, first of all, who in their right mind would remake Hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? I admit I had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason.

It works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. Why not update the dialog?

The actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing John Anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original.

"For producer David O. Selznick, no one director would ever do. Hence, on ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) we get two  Charles Vidor and John Huston.

Tired, frail, minus his studio, and, with an impending sense that his [[second]] [[marriage]] to Jennifer Jones might have been a mistake, Selznick handed the creative reigns of this flick over to Fox Studios  but he kept enough of himself in it to become a damn nuisance on the set.<br /><br />By now one is, or should be familiar with the bittersweet tragic love story of a nurse, [[Catharine]] Barkley (Jennifer Jones) and her soldier hero, Lt. Frederick Henry (Rock Hudson). Their passion is supposed to serve as the stabilizing force for what is essentially a war correspondent's tale with romanticism thrown in for good measure. But the chemistry between Hudson and Jones is both turgid and dull. In the final reel, Jones' facial contortions during child birth are so bad I am surprised that neither director opted to cut them from the general release.

"Deepa has again tried to bravely bring out a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story line is OK, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average.

The current actors Lisa Ray (who's just good for [[squirming]] in Bombay Dyeing [[bedsheets]]) and John Abraham are [[pathetic]], need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the movie as much as they can. The kid had done an outstanding job.

The story line is OK, cinematography is outstanding, screenplay and acting are way below average.

Trinian's, that [[remarkably]] easy-going [[English]] [[school]] for [[girls]] [[led]] by [[headmistress]] [[Millicent]] Fritton ([[Alastair]] Sim). As [[Miss]] Fritton is fond of pointing out, ""In other [[schools]] [[girls]] are [[sent]] out [[quite]] unprepared into a merciless [[world]], but when our [[girls]] [[leave]] here, it is the merciless [[world]] which [[has]] to [[be]] [[prepared]]."" [[Miss]] Fritton sounds something like a melding of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and [[definitely]] [[has]] Sim's [[droll]] and deadpan [[comic]] [[genes]]. <br /><br />[[In]] [[The]] Belles of St. Trinian's, a sly, chaotic [[comedy]] from the [[team]] of [[Frank]] [[Launder]] and Sidney Gilliat, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the brink of [[financial]] [[disaster]]. Salvation may [[be]] at [[hand]], however, when a [[rich]] sheik [[sends]] his daughter to join the fourth form and [[receive]] a [[proper]] [[English]] [[education]]. The sheik also is a horse [[owner]] and one of his prize racers, Arab Boy, is being trained [[near]] the school for a race. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- form girls form a racing pool and bet heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and lower by rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. ""It's got something...I don't know quite what,"" says Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff, ""but send a few bottles up to my room."") <br /><br />Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair Sim), a [[bookmaker]] who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns in a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. ""Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!"" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is ""a gay arcadia of happy girls."" Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors.

The priest is having a disturbing dream...supposedly a harbinger of nastiness to come since he seems hell bent on opening the archaeological feature which houses the demon. The dream is a goofy [[collage]] of [[disjointed]] images right out of the Twilight Zone's stock footage. A ticking clock careens through the dream scape's blackness implying, what?, the unfathomable mystery of Time?....big deal! A disembodied head, painted in demon features with convenience store quality Halloween make-up, flickers back and forth in a convulsive [[frenzy]]. [[Every]] [[time]] [[I]] [[see]] this effect, a [[big]] [[fat]] rip-off from Jacob's Ladder, it pisses me off. This, in itself, almost instantly discredits a [[film]]. <br /><br />[[The]] whole build-up of the [[archaeological]] [[dig]] itself is [[laughable]]. [[Everything]] is so [[obvious]]...[[so]] [[tired]] and over-wrought...the only [[possible]] response is [[boredom]]. [[At]] one [[point]] in the [[dig]], the priest [[comments]] on [[finding]] the [[statues]] of [[Angels]] [[surrounding]] a sarcophagus...they're all [[pointing]] down toward the crypt with their [[weapons]]. [[He]] [[queries]] ""[[Look]] at these [[surrounding]] [[statues]]....It's as if they are [[holding]]..something..down!"" [[This]] is [[supposed]] to [[build]] [[tension]]...[[critical]] [[mass]]..but it doesn't even come close! How can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to EXPLAIN the suspense as you go along. The imagery is over-done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Soon thereafter, the tomb is ""decorated"" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless rip-off of The Keep, btw). Who, for crying out loud, did the make-up effects for this film??! The blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70's Tromaville flicks. At this point I became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money.<br /><br />DON'T listen to glowing comments on this one!

The imagery is over-done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion. Soon thereafter, the tomb is ""decorated"" with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main atrium (another shameless rip-off of The Keep, btw). Who, for crying out loud, did the make-up effects for this film??! The blood actually had that pinkish quality one might see in 70's Tromaville flicks. At this point I became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make-up and had to go to Wal-Mart in the interest of time and money.<br /><br />DON'T listen to glowing comments on this one!

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routine]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack.

Example: Large: ""What are you listening to?"" Sam: ""The Shins. Ever heard of 'em?"" ""No."" ""Listen to this song - it will change your life!"" And then they proceed to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (Don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? I love that! Hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to ""chuckle,"" ""Say 'aaaaaw'"" ""cry"" ""feel inspired"" etc.) <br /><br />-The scenes were SO BAD. SO Cliché.

[[Or]] [[maybe]] it was just the [[poor]] productions values... hard to say.<br /><br />Anyway, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a film that just doesn't [[work]]. That's a shame, too, since the film has a terrific [[opening]] and a [[generally]] [[interesting]] [[plot]]. Ultimitely the production values are just too [[low]] and the action just too [[sparse]] for this New Zealand adventure to deliver the goods.

Little [[does]] he [[know]] that once he [[sells]] them, the local jeweler [[gets]] on the [[phone]] and [[starts]] [[trying]] to [[track]] down info about the plane. Before you can [[blink]], all of the attention brings a [[wealthy]] scumbag (Peppard) and his henchmen into [[town]] and they [[quickly]] try to force the [[old]] [[guy]] to [[give]] up the [[location]] of the [[plane]] [[since]] they know there is [[much]] more on it than just medals. The [[old]] drunk's business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) then race out to try and claim the fortune before the bad guys can get to it. The resulting action just isn't as fun as you'd hope it would be.<br /><br />The acting is rather awful, save for Pleasence. George Peppard tries to do some kind of (I guess) Austrailian accent, but it is hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren isn't too bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He's basically doing his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that's saying something. Hopefully he made enough money on this film to fix his front teeth which looked a bit crooked. I don't recall if he'd had them straightened by the time he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast are pretty untalented. Probably mostly locals who never did much else. I guess the biggest problems for me were the lack of action for much of the film, and the lack of danger. The villains are just too nice and goofy to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are NO helicopters in the film that look like the ones on the DVD cover. And none of the boats in the film have teeth painted on them, either.<br /><br />The film does have its strengths, though. The beginning which starts off as a newsreel and then becomes part of the story was a nice touch. Brian May's score sounds a little too much like the one in Mad Max 2, but he included a nice little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds just like the one in the Great Escape! There are some neat helicopter stunts and a great boat chase that apparently killed three stunt men during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy look of the picture, is still quite beautiful.

The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly from the British; rather, Australia would be run by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the British system. This shift was codified in the Australian Constitution.

[[These]] are more or less regarded as the ""reserve powers of the Crown (king/queen of Great Britain)."" The first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the Governor-general. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the Queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the ""Executive"" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian parliament, the [[constitution]] states that it only [[becomes]] law when it is signed by the Governor-general. As such, the Govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-general can [[refuse]] to sign a law passed by Australian parliament if he thinks fit. For instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By ""convention"" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to sign it, he will, almost always without question. In fact, by ""convention"" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the Governor-general's ""pleasure."" Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or Prime Minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film ""the dismissal."") Whether 'at the Governor-General's pleasure' can be construed as ""the unfettered right to dismiss"" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia.<br /><br />Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. It didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the Governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />In terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. The film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. There were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Further, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them.

"For those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production, beware: no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with a few variations thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of Keystone Cop tactics.<br /><br />Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's obese, alcoholic, loose morals aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's chubby daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of Indian ways - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it, a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells a 'little lie' to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house they discover the drunken Vanessa, are repulsed by her, but eventually decide that for Jimi's happiness they will go along with the fact that Vanessa has given them a 'granddaughter' and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to go along with the idea and before long Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents, includes Jack as his best man. At the wedding the truth comes out and to Jimi's surprise his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved by simply being truthful.<br /><br />The cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs as Vanessa; the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles they've played countless times in Indian movies.

"Intruder in the [[Dust]] (1949) Dir: Clarence [[Brown]] <br /><br />[[Production]]: [[MGM]]<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Excellent]] 'Southern Gothic' [[tale]], [[adapted]] from the Faulkner novel, about a [[black]] [[man]], [[accused]] of the [[murder]] of a [[white]] man, who [[asks]] a [[young]] [[white]] [[boy]] he [[has]] [[befriended]] to [[help]] him [[prove]] his innocence. [[Lucas]] Beauchamp (Juano [[Hernandez]]) is something of an [[anomaly]] in this [[small]] [[town]]. He's a [[black]] [[man]] who [[owns]] the [[land]] he [[lives]] on and doesn't [[think]] much of the diseased social order that mostly keeps the peace here and in many similar small towns. So when Lucas is found holding a gun over the [[dead]] [[body]] of Vinson Gowrie, shot in the back no less, young Chick Mallison (Claude Jarman) (who Lucas once [[saved]] after [[Chick]] [[fell]] through the [[ice]] while [[hunting]] on his land) [[fears]] that the [[town]] finally [[has]] the [[chance]] to ""[[make]] Lucas a n*****."" Arrested, and with a [[very]] real [[chance]] of being lynched before the [[night]] is through, Lucas [[reaches]] out to Chick for [[help]], as the only [[person]] he [[knows]] ""not cluttered with notions"". [[Chick]] [[asks]] his [[Uncle]] [[John]], a lawyer, to [[defend]] Lucas and while the [[man]] is [[initially]] [[bothered]] by his [[own]] [[notions]] he [[agrees]] and they [[race]] against the [[gathering]] mob to [[save]] Lucas' [[life]].<br /><br />The [[film]] [[has]] an [[uncommon]] frankness for its [[time]] and is mostly [[free]] of moralizing. The [[lawyer]] character [[has]] a [[tendency]] to [[speak]] [[incredibly]] self-aware dialogue that [[sounds]] mostly like something from the [[printed]] [[page]], but it [[has]] [[minimal]] [[impact]] on the tone. That's a credit to the [[rich]] characterization of everyone else. Juano Hernandez, who [[had]] mostly [[appeared]] in [[Oscar]] Micheaux [[films]], is [[superb]] as the [[proud]] [[Lucas]]. [[Porter]] [[Hall]] as the [[murdered]] man's father, in [[maybe]] the best [[role]] I've ever seen him in, and [[Elizabeth]] Patterson as a [[plucky]] [[old]] lady sympathetic to Lucas' case, standout in [[support]] roles. [[The]] setting is [[perfectly]] [[realized]]. It is actually filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, Faulkner's hometown. [[Brown]] also [[uses]] the [[crowd]] in an [[effective]] [[way]], it's [[always]] an [[anonymous]] mob against a single person (like Lucas when he's [[arrested]] or John when he's going up to his [[office]]), that is [[very]] [[threatening]].

"""Stripperella"" is an [[animated]] [[series]] about a [[girl]] [[named]] [[Erotica]] Jones ([[voiced]] by [[Pamela]] Anderson) who [[lives]] a [[double]] [[life]] as a [[stripper]] at a gentleman's club [[known]] as ""The [[Tender]] [[Loins]]"" and as a [[sexy]] crime-fighter [[known]] as Stripperella, a.k.a. [[Agent]] 69 who [[works]] for a government [[organization]]. [[As]] Stripperella, [[Erotica]] [[fights]] [[crime]] and the [[forces]] of [[evil]] such as a [[plastic]] [[surgeon]] who [[gives]] [[women]] breast [[implants]] that either explode or [[make]] them fat and Cheapo, a [[criminal]] who steals from 99 cent [[stores]] and [[makes]] his [[two]] [[henchmen]] [[share]] a [[gun]]. The [[creator]] of the [[character]] and the [[series]] is Stan [[Lee]] of Marvel [[fame]] (and [[creator]] of Spider-Man).<br /><br />[[Back]] in late [[June]] of 2003, [[Spike]] TV (then [[known]] as The New TNN) premiered a [[Thursday]] [[night]] [[block]] of [[three]] [[animated]] [[shows]]. Those [[shows]] were ""Ren & Stimpy: [[Adult]] [[Party]] [[Cartoon]]""; [[new]] [[adventures]] of [[classic]] [[kids]] [[show]] [[characters]] [[Ren]] and Stimpy for adults [[done]] by [[original]] [[creator]] [[John]] Kricfalusi, ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee [[Grammar]] of ""[[Cheers]]"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who [[doubles]] as a [[superhero]] [[voiced]] by [[Pamela]] [[Anderson]] and [[created]] by Stan Lee. [[I]] [[remember]] [[seeing]] all [[three]] of the premiers. [[I]] was anxious to [[see]] Ren and Stimpy as I love the [[original]] [[show]]. I was a little [[let]] down. [[It]] was [[alright]] but it seemed to [[take]] things a little too [[far]]; seeing the [[two]] [[have]] gay [[sex]] [[together]] was a bit [[much]]. Though Gary the Rat wasn't [[bad]], the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an awesome intro [[song]], it [[had]] some good [[talent]] behind it, and it was funny as hell! The [[show]] was just so silly, I don't even [[know]] how to begin explaining it! [[After]] four of five weeks (if not a [[little]] [[less]]) the [[animation]] block [[disappeared]], which was weird because [[I]] [[know]] it got good [[ratings]] and it was [[advertised]] everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to [[see]] one and [[though]] it was [[funny]] as hell and I was [[glad]] to see the show back after all that [[time]], something seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy.
