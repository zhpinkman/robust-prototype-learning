"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

"[[James]] [[Edwin]] [[Campbell]] ([[July]] [[7]], 1843 ‚Äì [[December]] 18, [[1924]]) was a [[Democratic]] [[politician]] from [[Ohio]]. [[He]] [[served]] as the 38th [[Governor]] of Ohio. Campbell was [[born]] in Middletown, Ohio where he [[attended]] the public schools and then [[Miami]] University. He [[served]] in the Union [[Army]] as a [[member]] of the Mississippi [[River]] Squadron during the [[Civil]] [[War]]. He was a [[master's]] [[mate]] on the [[gunboats]] Elk and [[Naiad]] until his health [[gave]] out and he returned [[home]] emaciated. James Campbell was [[admitted]] to the [[bar]] in 1865 and began [[practicing]] law in Hamilton, Ohio two [[years]] later. Campbell was married to Maud Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, 1870. [[They]] had four children. [[He]] was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio from 1876‚Äì1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district ([[Forty-eighth]] and [[Fiftieth]] Congresses) and once from the third district ([[Forty-ninth]] Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from 1884-1889. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio governorship, serving from 1890 to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1891, losing to future president William McKinley. During his term as governor, he signed a bill enacting the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of Democrats in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895. Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio State University 1895-1896. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to codify the State of Ohio laws from 1908-1911. Campbell was nominated for Congress in 1906, but lost, and was his party's choice for Senator in 1908, but was again defeated. In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the Board of Trustees as president on September 25, 1918. He served as president until his death. He resumed the practice of law in Columbus, Ohio after 1892 and died there in 1924. He was a Mason, a member of the order of the Elks, the Columbus Club, the Scioto Country Club, the Presbyterian Church, the Grand Army of the Republic, the American Legion, and the Kit Kat Club of Columbus.

"[[Russells]] Hall Hospital is an [[NHS]] [[general]] hospital [[located]] in [[Dudley]], West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the [[borough's]] [[in-patient]] services. [[The]] first phases of the [[work]] were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had [[doubled]] in size.

"[[Cettiidae]] is a [[newly]] validated family of [[small]] [[insectivorous]] songbirds (\""warblers\""), formerly [[placed]] in the [[Old]] [[World]] warbler \""wastebin\"" [[assemblage]]. [[It]] [[contains]] the [[typical]] [[bush]] warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. [[As]] a [[common]] [[name]], [[cettiid]] [[warblers]] is [[usually]] [[used]]. Its members [[occur]] mainly in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], [[ranging]] into Oceania and [[Europe]]. The monarch [[warblers]] (Erythrocercus), tit [[hylia]] [[Pholidornis]] and green [[hylia]] ([[Hylia]]) are [[exclusively]] found in the forests of [[Africa]]. The [[pseudo-tailorbirds]], tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and Abroscopus warblers are [[mostly]] found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia, with one species reaching as [[far]] north as Japan and [[Siberia]]. [[The]] genus Cettia has the widest distribution of the [[family]], reaching from Western Europe [[across]] Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and [[Palau]]. Most of the species in the genus are sedentary, but the Asian stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and Cetti's warbler are partly migratory over much of their [[range]]. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush [[warbler]], are [[altitudinal]] migrants. The species are small, [[stubby]] birds. Most have moderately [[long]] to long tails, while the stubtails and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is [[typically]] [[clad]] in dull plumage, often with a line above the [[eye]]. Some, like the monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), are much different in appearance, having areas of bright yellow plumage. Altogether the Cettiidae are a quite variable group containing many [[aberrant]] birds that [[hitherto]] had been uncomfortably placed with a wide [[range]] of [[unrelated]] [[families]]. The Megaluridae which contain birds which appear very [[similar]] to many [[cettiids]] are [[far]] more uniform by contrast.

"Mal√° Fatra (Slovak pronunciation: [[[ÀàmalaÀê]] Ààfatra]; also Little [[Fatra]] or Lesser Fatra, Polish: [[Ma≈Ça]] Fatra) is a mountain range in the [[Western]] Carpathians in the [[north-west]] of Central Slovakia. In the geomorphological system, it is a part of the [[Fatra-Tatra]] Area. It is situated approximately between the cities of [[Nitrianske]] [[Pravno]], Streƒçno, Martin and Z√°zriv√°. [[Turƒçianska]] [[kotlina]] ([[Turiec]] Basin) and the [[Oravsk√°]] [[vrchovina]] Mts. are situated to the west of the range, and [[≈Ωilinsk√°]] [[kotlina]] ([[≈Ωilina]] Basin) and the Kysuck√° [[vrchovina]] Mts. is located to the east. Mal√° Fatra consists of two subdivisions separated by the V√°h river near Streƒçno: \n*  [[L√∫ƒçansk√°]] Mal√° [[Fatra]] \n*  [[Kriv√°nska]] Mal√° Fatra The highest peak is [[Veƒæk√Ω]] Kriv√°≈à at 1,[[709]] m AMSL in Kriv√°nska Mal√° [[Fatra]]. Mal√° Fatra is basically one big karst object. It is made up of crystalline rocks and [[complexes]] of Mesozoic strongly folded rocks. The main peaks of L√∫ƒçansk√° Mal√° [[Fatra]] are Veƒæk√° L√∫ka (1,[[475]] m), Kƒæak (1,351 m) and Minƒçol (1,364).

The 12 km long pass between Kriv√°nska Mal√° Fatra and L√∫ƒçansk√° Mal√° Fatra separated by the V√°h is called Streƒçnianska ties≈àava (Streƒçno Pass), located below the ruins of the famous Streƒçno Castle. The Dierov√Ω potok stream created a complex of canyons, waterfalls and cascades in that area. ≈†√∫tovo Waterfall (≈†√∫tovsk√Ω vodop√°d ) is the highest waterfall in Mal√° Fatra and has a vertical drop of 38 m.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver something distinctly harder edged\"".",0.5271174907684326,0.745708703994751,0,6,0,277,"Successful"

He served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to 33,629), but under Georgia's election laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872).

"[[Patoka]] Lake is the second-largest [[reservoir]] in the U.S. [[state]] of Indiana (after Lake [[Monroe]]) and is spread across [[Dubois]], Crawford, and [[Orange]] counties in southern [[Indiana]].

"Dark Discoveries is an internationally distributed, quarterly slick [[magazine]] formerly published by Dark [[Discoveries]] [[Publications]], and now published by Journalstone, LLC. [[It]] focuses primarily on the horror fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction genres. The [[magazine's]] content includes short fiction, interviews, nonfiction articles, profiles of industry notables, and is fully illustrated. Dark Discoveries Publications was originally founded in January, 2004 by James R. Beach of Longview, WA. The magazine began as a black and white periodical with David Emrich, of David Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from 2004 to 2007. Together Editor-in-chief Beach and designer Emrich created the basic look and feel of the magazine that continued through the first ten issues. Designer Cesar Puch briefly took over the layout for two issues in 2008, but left for a job with Bad Moon Books after that. Dark Discoveries then became a color publication in 2009 after Jason V Brock became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni Productions, LLC, who also maintained the Dark Discoveries website) and Art Director in 2008, helping to salvage the magazine from being discontinued by publisher Beach. Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press.

"Oleg [[Mikhailovich]] [[Romanishin]] (born 10 [[January]] [[1952]] in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] chess grandmaster and [[former]] European junior champion. Many honours and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In [[1974]] he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in [[Teesside]], England, where he [[scored]] the best [[result]] for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris [[Gulko]], Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran [[Petrosian]]. In [[1976]], his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojeviƒá) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Gy√∂r in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at [[Sochi]] in 1982.

In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, [[offbeat]] and [[sometimes]], [[long]] since discarded systems.

"Pandora (/p√¶nÀàd…î…ôr…ô/ [[pan-DOHR-…ô]]; Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œéœÅŒ±) is an inner [[satellite]] of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby [[Prometheus]], and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on [[moon's]] surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with [[Prometheus]].

"Ricky S. Moore (born April 10, 1976) is a retired American basketball player and current coach. He is currently an assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He played professionally for eleven years. Moore came to UConn after an All-American high school career at Westside High School in Augusta, Georgia. He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998‚Äì99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard [[Trajan]] Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily-favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team.

Moore (born April 10, 1976) is a retired American basketball player and current coach. He is currently an assistant at the University of Connecticut (UConn). He played professionally for eleven years. Moore came to UConn after an All-American high school career at Westside High School in Augusta, Georgia. He was a three-time co-captain for the Huskies, including the school's first national championship team in 1998‚Äì99. That year, Moore averaged 6.8 points and 3.6 assists per game. In the 1999 National Championship game, Moore's defense on Duke's William Avery, and his ability to guard [[Tr…ëjan]] Langdon in the final seconds, was seen as one of the keys to the Huskies defeat of the heavily-favored Blue Devils and Moore was named to the All-Final Four team.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7¬±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72¬±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 ‚Äì a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings ‚Äì in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, holographic screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011. At the function he went on to felicitate the people who contributed majorly to the project and held a candid question and answer session with revered J. P. Vaswani. The Sadhu Vaswani Mission is a charitable organisation based in Pune with branches all over the world. Originally known as the 'The Brotherhood Association' it was renamed to Sadhu Vaswani Mission upon the demise of its founder and spiritual head, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani. The organisation is well known for its philanthropic work in the fields of education, healthcare, rural development, spiritual upliftment and feeding of the poor through its community kitchens. Its current spiritual head is noted humanitarian, educationist, philanthropist, poet and modern saint, J. P. Vaswani who is affectionately called 'Dada' (meaning elder brother) by his followers.",0.6101503372192383,0.7876272201538086,2,6,2,263,"Successful"

In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers.

While Mann was working as a milliner in the 1950s, he became particularly known for his creative 1960s designs, such as designs with incorporated pockets and lace [[baby-bonnetÀóstyle]] caps. In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers. This led to Mann becoming, briefly, one of the most desirable [[mill—ñners]] in London at that time. In [[196ùüï]], one of Mann's [[hat—ï]] was chosen by Felicity Green of The Daily Mirror as part of her Dress of the Year selection for the Fashion Museum, Bath.

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the [[Basidiomycota]], [[form]] the subkingdom [[Dikarya]]. Its members are [[commonly]] known as the [[sac]] fungi or ascomycetes. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the [[Ascomycota]] are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. [[Previously]] placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or [[physiological]] similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for [[medicinally]] important compounds, such as antibiotics and for [[making]] bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and [[plants]]. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. [[The]] fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens ([[loosely]] [[termed]] \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the [[Ascomycota]].

[[Several]] [[species]] of [[ascomycetes]] are [[biological]] [[model]] organisms in [[laboratory]] research.

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the [[Canadian]] province of Ontario, at an [[estimated]] 693 m ([[2]],[[274]] ft) above [[sea]] level. Ishpatina [[Ridge]] [[rises]] approximately 300 m (984 ft) above the immediate area. It was only truly recognized as Ontario's highest point after federal government topographical mapping [[revealed]] this fact in the 1970s. Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. [[The]] ridge lies in [[Lady]] [[Evelyn-Smoothwater]] [[Provincial]] Park. Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The [[closest]] major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km [[north]]. There are a few logging [[roads]] and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the [[town]] of Capreol [[north]] of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are [[numerous]] portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane. The name \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an Ojibwe language word [[ishpadinaa]], meaning \""high [[place]]/[[ridge]]\"". The city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette County, and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same word. Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the highest point in Ontario, at least one other geographic feature, Maple Mountain (approximately 25 km to the east) has greater prominence, 37 m (121 ft) higher than Ishpatina Ridge's rise over Scarecrow Lake. An abandoned firetower, often referred to as the Ellis Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original tower was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The towerman would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have hiked a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again. Located between Tower Peak and the North Peak, the Ishpatina Canyon is one of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower Peak is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level. The canyon is nearly twice as deep as Ouimet Canyon, often considered Ontario's deepest. However, the more gradual descent into the canyon hides the fact.

He [[served]] in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a [[consumer]] advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. [[As]] attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit [[system]]. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary ‚Äì largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education ‚Äì and defeated Fletcher in the general election.

He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"S√£o Paulo LGBT Pride Parade (Portuguese: Parada do Orgulho LGBT de S√£o Paulo) is an annual gay pride parade that [[happens]] in Avenida Paulista, in the city of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, since 1997. In the year of 2006, it was considered the biggest pride parade of the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. In 2010, the city hall of S√£o Paulo invested R$ 1 million reais in the parade. The event is the second largest of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best of the world. The Pride and its associated events are organized by the APOGLBT, Associa√ß√£o da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais, since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities as well as to the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual S√£o Paulo Gay Pride Parade. The meeting point is at the Museum of Art of S√£o Paulo (MASP ‚Äì Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo) right at the middle of S√£o Paulo's postcard Avenida Paulista. Even though the meeting time is at 12 noon, the parade doesn't start to move before 2 or 3 PM. The parade is 2.6 miles long (4.2 km) and starts at Avenida Paulista (MASP), at around noon. It follows Rua da Consola√ß√£o to the end at [[Pra√ßa]] Roosevelt, in Downtown S√£o Paulo, at around 10 PM. Strongly supported by the State and the City of S√£o Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan. These are last [[year's]] numbers: approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds.

"[[Hugo]] Lafayette Black (February 27, 1886 ‚Äì September 25, 1971) was an American politician who served as a Democratic United States Senator and represented Alabama in the Senate from 1927 to 1937, and served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1937 to 1971.

"The [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents.

"The [[Taradale]] Viaduct is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for ¬£3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O‚ÄôHara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in 1860 in the Royal Society‚Äôs Transactions. Introduction of heavier locomotives in the 20th century required strengthening of the bridge with steel trestles added between the original masonry piers in 1933-1934.

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] FRCS (September 28, [[1868]] ‚Äì June 23, [[1963]]), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of [[Toronto]] and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the [[Royal]] College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the [[rank]] of [[colonel]] in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). [[Bruce]] [[investigated]] medical practices in the army and [[issued]] a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. [[Few]] of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. [[Bruce's]] report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. [[Bennett]] for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the [[vice-regal]] office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"[[Sir]] [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] SL (1 November [[1609]] ‚Äì 25 [[December]] [[1676]]) was an influential [[English]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a [[strict]] Puritan, and inherited his [[faith]]. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barrister]] like his [[father]] thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he [[joined]] [[Lincoln's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on [[17]] [[May]] [[1636]]. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the [[English]] Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[William]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his [[state]] trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] [[used]]. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the [[Commission's]] [[dissolution]], [[Oliver]] [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] Pleas. As a [[judge]], Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his [[willingness]] to [[make]] politically [[unpopular]] decisions which upheld the law. He [[sat]] in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of [[Parliament]] who moved to [[consider]] Charles [[II's]] [[reinstatement]] as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. [[Under]] Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King's]] Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a [[particularly]] innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he [[retired]] on 20 [[February]] [[1676]], dying [[ten]] months later on 25 [[December]] [[1676]]. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, [[published]] after his death. His Historia Placitorum [[Coron√¶]], [[dealing]] with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of [[English]] law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and [[John]] Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Si‚≤Ö]] [[Matthe‘ù]] [[Ha‚Öºe]] SL (1 November [[160‡ß≠]] ‚Äì 25 [[Decembe‚≤Ö]] [[1]] [[676]]) was an influential [[Engli—ïh]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[PlacitoruÔΩç]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.

Demetrius was a [[Greek]] [[Orthodox]] Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli.

The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final.

"The SM [[Kirov]] Stadium was a [[multi-purpose]] stadium in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The stadium was named after Sergey [[Kirov]]. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world.

In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place.
