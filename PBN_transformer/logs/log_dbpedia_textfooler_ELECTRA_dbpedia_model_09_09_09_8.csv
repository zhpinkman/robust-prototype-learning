The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. The planning policies of the Mayor of London are detailed in a statutory London Plan that is regularly updated and published. The Greater London Authority is mostly funded by direct government grant and it is also a precepting authority, with some money collected with local Council Tax. The GLA is unique in the British local government system, in terms of structure, elections and selection of powers. The authority was established to replace a range of joint boards and quangos and provided an elected upper tier of local government in London for the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986.",0.2533490061759949,0.8022187352180481,0,2,0,256,"Successful"

Meg Mallon shot a [[definitive]] round 67 (−4) to finish at 283 (−1), two strokes ahead of runner-up Pat Bradley. Mallon trailed Bradley by three strokes with ten holes to play. It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's [[Tennis]] and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest. While playing the 14th hole, Garbacz had her [[wagon]] go to a nearby pay phone and [[injunction]] a pizza that she wanted [[deployed]] to the 17th tee. The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier. Through 2015, this is the only time the championship has been played in the state of Texas.

[[In]] [[March]] 2005, a rotational light-curve for this [[asteroid]] was [[obtained]] from photometric [[observations]] by U.[[S]]. astronomer [[Brian]] D.

This [[previously]] published [[period]] was only [[preliminary]] and is now [[considered]] [[wrong]] upon re-examination.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

The two highways [[execute]] north from Dothan through the Wiregrass region of southeastern Alabama through the towns of Headland and Abbeville en route to Eufaula, where it intersects U.S. Route 82. North of Eufaula, en route to Phenix City, the highway encounters some of the most sparsely populated parts of the state, only passing near the unincorporated communities of Pittsview, Glenville, and Seale in the 46 mile (74 km) drive between the two cities. In Phenix City, the highway junctions with U.S. Route 280 and U.S. Route 80. North of Phenix City, en route to Opelika, US 431 and US 280 join together for a concurrency, passing through the cities of Smiths Station and Salem on the way into Opelika. In Opelika, the two highways cross Interstate 85 and split in Opelika; US 431 continuing northeastward and US 280 northwestward. North of Opelika, the highway encounters rural terrain again, passing through the cities of LaFayette, Roanoke, and Wedowee en route to Anniston. In Oxford, just south of Anniston, the highway intersects Interstate 20, joining I-20 for an approximately three-mile concurrency, after which it goes through Anniston, northward into Gadsden, where it joins with US-278, crosses Interstate 59, and shares a brief wrong-way concurrency with US-11 in nearby Attalla, after which it continues northwestward, splitting from US-278 northwest of Attalla and later passing through Guntersville en route to Huntsville.
