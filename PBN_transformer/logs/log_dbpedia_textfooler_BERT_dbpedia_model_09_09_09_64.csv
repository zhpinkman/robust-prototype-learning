"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Freeza makes his debut in Chapter #247: Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek (暗雲うずまくナメック星 An'un Uzumaku Namekkusei), first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 6, 1989, as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe. Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Freeza is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the series due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. He is also directly responsible for the murder of Burdock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, and the second death of Kuririn, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy.","Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

"Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game [[versions]] of Hajime Kanzaka's media [[franchise]] Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[spoof]] [[symptomatic]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game [[copies]] of Hajime Kanzaka's media [[sincerity]] Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

"Yesterday's [[Children]] were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"".

Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

In the Midwestern Division for the 1979–80 season, the Does finished with a record of 11 wins and 24 losses. Their coach for the 1979–80 season was Larry Costello, who had been the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks for eight seasons, starting in April 1968, and had coached the team to four division titles and an NBA championship in the 1970–71 season. Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.",0.8769785761833191,0.8769785761833191,6,6,0,1,"Skipped"

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, [[United]] [[States]], founded in 1995 by [[Dan]] and [[Sue]] Weirback. The brewery is well [[known]] for its \""[[huge]] [[taste]]\"" [[beers]]. [[Most]] of their [[brews]] are [[high]] in [[alcohol]], with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale [[called]] Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Blithering]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex [[flavor]] profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher [[released]] a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops [[grown]] by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011.

[[Higher]] of their [[swilling]] are [[upstairs]] in [[liquor]], with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale [[drew]] Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Dimwitted]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex [[tasting]] profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher [[aired]] a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops [[expanded]] by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011. As a result, brewing capacity was expanded from 10,000 to 30,000 barrels per [[anniversary]] in 2012.",0.03815943002700806,0.5665491819381714,0,2,0,826,"Successful"

"The Arkansas RiverBlades was a short-lived minor-league ice hockey [[team]] located in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

"[[The]] naval [[Battle]] of the Solent [[took]] [[place]] on 18 and 19 [[July]] 1545 during the [[Italian]] [[Wars]], [[fought]] between the [[fleets]] of [[Francis]] I of [[France]] and [[Henry]] VIII of [[England]], in the Solent [[channel]] off the south [[coast]] of [[England]] between [[Hampshire]] and the [[Isle]] of [[Wight]]. The [[engagement]] was [[inconclusive]] and is most [[notable]] for the [[sinking]] of the [[English]] carrack [[Mary]] [[Rose]]. [[In]] 1545, [[Francis]] [[launched]] an [[invasion]] of [[England]] with 30,000 [[soldiers]] in more than 200 [[ships]]. Against this armada — larger than the [[Spanish]] [[Armada]] forty-three years later — the [[English]] had about 80 [[ships]] and 12,000 [[soldiers]]. The French [[expedition]] [[started]] disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an [[accidental]] [[fire]] at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his [[flag]] to La Maistresse which then [[ran]] [[aground]] as the [[fleet]] [[set]] [[sail]]. [[The]] leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the [[Channel]]. The French [[entered]] the Solent and [[landed]] [[troops]] on the [[Isle]] of [[Wight]] and the [[Sussex]] [[coast]]. The [[French]] [[invasion]] force which [[had]] landed at the [[Isle]] of [[Wight]] were [[defeated]], and [[forced]] to [[retreat]], by a [[local]] [[militia]] in the [[Battle]] of Bonchurch. [[On]] 18 [[July]] 1545 the [[English]] [[came]] out of [[Portsmouth]] and [[engaged]] the [[French]] at [[long]] range, little [[damage]] being [[done]] on either side. La Maitresse was on the [[point]] of [[sinking]] due to the [[damage]] she [[had]] [[sustained]] [[earlier]] but although d'Annebault [[had]] to [[change]] his flagship again she was [[saved]] from foundering. On the [[night]] of 18 [[July]] [[Henry]] dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and [[sank]] with the loss of all but 35–40 of her crew.

The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels.
