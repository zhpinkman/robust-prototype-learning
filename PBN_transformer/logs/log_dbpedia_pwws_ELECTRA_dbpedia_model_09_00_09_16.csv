"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced [[Arsenal]] Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"The Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (HB&WRJR&DCo.) was opened on 20 July 1885. It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885. The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an eight-mile branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway). Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER).

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the Canadian [[province]] of Ontario, at an [[estimated]] 693 m (2,274 ft) above [[sea]] level. Ishpatina [[Ridge]] [[rises]] [[approximately]] 300 m (984 ft) above the immediate [[area]]. It was only [[truly]] [[recognized]] as Ontario's [[highest]] [[point]] after [[federal]] [[government]] topographical mapping [[revealed]] this fact in the 1970s. [[Before]] then, the more popular Maple [[Mountain]] was [[thought]] to be [[higher]]. The [[ridge]] [[lies]] in [[Lady]] Evelyn-Smoothwater [[Provincial]] [[Park]]. Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to [[reach]]. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than [[30]] km [[north]]. There are a few logging [[roads]] and [[trails]] in the [[remote]] [[area]], but they are [[difficult]] to [[travel]] in [[poor]] [[weather]]. The most [[popular]] [[approach]] [[route]] to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the [[south]] out of the [[town]] of Capreol [[north]] of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the [[nearest]] community), there are [[numerous]] portages [[making]] it particularly [[onerous]]. This [[route]] has traditionally been [[used]] for a winter-time [[approach]] by ski/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a [[fire]] [[tower]] atop the ridge was [[staffed]] by [[forest]] [[workers]] and they would have been ferried to the [[site]] by [[float]] [[plane]]. The [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" [[comes]] from an Ojibwe [[language]] [[word]] ishpadinaa, meaning \""[[high]] [[place]]/ridge\"". The [[city]] of Ishpeming, [[Michigan]], in Marquette County, and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario [[derive]] their [[names]] from the same [[word]]. Although the Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the [[highest]] [[point]] in Ontario, at least [[one]] other geographic [[feature]], Maple [[Mountain]] ([[approximately]] 25 km to the [[east]]) has [[greater]] [[prominence]], 37 m (121 ft) [[higher]] than Ishpatina Ridge's [[rise]] over [[Scarecrow]] Lake. An [[abandoned]] firetower, [[often]] [[referred]] to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is still [[standing]] on the [[highest]] [[section]] of the [[Ridge]] ([[left]]). The [[original]] [[tower]] was an [[80]] [[ft]] structure erected in 1930. The [[successor]], [[currently]] [[standing]], is [[100]] [[ft]] [[high]] and was [[abandoned]] in the 1960s. The towerman would have [[resided]] in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have [[hiked]] a [[3]].5 [[km]] [[trail]] daily [[taking]] [[approximately]] two hours to [[summit]] and a [[little]] over [[one]] hour to [[descend]] again. Located between Tower [[Peak]] and the [[North]] [[Peak]], the Ishpatina Canyon is [[one]] of the deepest in Ontario. The elevation of Tower [[Peak]] is 2274 feet, the bottom of the Canyon is at 1750 feet and the North Peak at 2250 feet above sea level.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar.

The meeting point is at the Museum of Art of São Paulo (MASP – Museu de Arte de São Paulo) right at the middle of São Paulo's postcard Avenida Paulista. Even though the meeting time is at 12 noon, the parade doesn't start to move before 2 or 3 PM. The parade is 2.6 miles long (4.2 km) and starts at Avenida Paulista (MASP), at around noon. It follows Rua da Consolação to the end at Praça Roosevelt, in Downtown São Paulo, at around 10 PM. Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan. These are last year's numbers: approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The São Paulo Gay Pride [[troop]] is heavily supported by the federal government as well as by the Governor of São Paulo and the City Major. Many politicians show up to open the main event and the government often parades with a float with politicians on top of it. Caixa Econômica Federal, a government bank and Petrobrás, Brazil's oil firm, have already reaffirmed their commitment to backup the event and its diversity, funding once again the event.In the Pride the city usually receives about 400,000 tourists and moves between R$ 180 million and R$ 190 million.",0.08985304832458496,0.537136435508728,5,2,5,2153,"Successful"

On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.

The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street. The Library is now run by Northern Ireland Libraries, a public authority covering the whole of Northern Ireland. Belfast Central Library houses a range of sections, including a lending library & Information and Business library still based in the original reading room. A Belfast, Ulster and Irish Department & Music Library on the top floor.
