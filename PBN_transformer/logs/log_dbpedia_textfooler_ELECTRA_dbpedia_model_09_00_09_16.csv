"On 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 [[Avril]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[setting]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], Pennsylvania, [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.

Hops Infusion is one of the [[bitterest]] [[examples]] of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of [[aging]] [[beer]] in [[wooden]] [[barrels]] previously used for aging [[bourbon]].

[[Cameron]] [[gained]] a 13% [[swing]] but [[lost]] by one [[vote]]. [[Cameron]] [[challenged]] the [[result]] at the [[Court]] of [[Disputed]] Returns, which [[ordered]] a by-election. Corcoran [[comfortably]] won the by-election. [[Early]] in 1969, [[Senator]] Keith Laught [[died]] [[suddenly]] and [[Cameron]] was [[nominated]] by [[Premier]] Steele [[Hall]] as his [[replacement]]. [[However]], Cameron's [[time]] in the Senate was [[brief]], for an [[election]] for the [[vacancy]] was [[held]] to coincide with the 1969 [[Federal]] [[Election]] in [[October]] and he was [[defeated]] by Labor's [[Don]] [[Cameron]] (no [[relation]]). [[Cameron]] [[entered]] South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the [[retirement]] of [[Sir]] Norman [[Jude]]. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now [[Leader]] of the [[Opposition]]), [[representing]] the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL [[Legislative]] Councillors, due to his [[support]] for [[Universal]] [[Suffrage]] for that [[chamber]]. This [[tension]] within the LCL led to the [[formation]] of the Liberal [[Movement]] the [[following]] [[year]]. [[Led]] by [[Hall]] and [[Robin]] Millhouse, the movement [[originally]] functioned as a [[faction]] within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most [[prominent]] [[supporters]]. [[After]] the 1973 [[Election]], the LCL ([[led]] at this [[stage]] by Bruce Eastick) [[expelled]] the Liberal [[Movement]]. [[Although]] some Liberal [[Movement]] [[members]], such as [[future]] Premiers David Tonkin and Dean [[Brown]], [[decided]] to [[remain]] in the LCL, [[Cameron]] [[left]] with [[Hall]] and Millhouse. [[Cameron]] was the only [[Liberal]] [[Movement]] [[member]] of the Legislative [[Council]] until the 1975 [[Election]] when he was [[joined]] by [[John]] Carnie. [[However]] the Liberal Movement was [[vastly]] outpolled by the LCL ([[renamed]] the Liberal [[Party]] of Australia in 1974), and there was a [[push]] from within both [[parties]] for [[reunification]]. [[In]] 1976 [[Cameron]] and [[Hall]] [[rejoined]] the Liberal [[Party]], while Millhouse [[initially]] [[formed]] the [[New]] [[LM]] before [[helping]] [[found]] the Australian [[Democrats]]. [[Despite]] not [[serving]] in the Tonkin [[ministry]], Cameron [[assumed]] the [[position]] of [[Leader]] of the [[Opposition]] in the [[Legislative]] [[Council]] after the [[election]] of the [[John]] Bannon [[Labor]] [[government]] at the 1982 [[Elections]]. [[He]] [[held]] this [[position]] until his [[retirement]] from [[politics]] in 1990. [[Following]] his [[retirement]] from the [[Council]], [[Cameron]] [[served]] a term as [[president]] of the South Australian [[branch]] of the Liberal [[Party]]. [[Later]], he became a vocal supporter of the 'yes' case in the 1999 republic referendum.","[[Martins]] Bruce Cameron (born 24 [[July]] 1936), [[O]] [[politicians]], was a [[gentlemen]] of the Australian [[Mcconnell]] and the South [[O]] [[Legislature]] [[Councils]]. [[Across]] 1968 Cameron [[doubted]] the [[harmless]] [[Occupation]] [[Rooms]] of [[Session]] [[sitting]] of [[Mathilda]] for the Liberal and [[Federal]] League (LCL) after [[favoring]] to the [[insights]] of incumbent [[Tak]] [[Mahoney]] on [[journeys]] [[movement]] [[verification]]. [[Nicholson]] [[gets]] a 13% [[flutter]] but [[faded]] by one [[referendum]]. [[Blair]] [[difficulty]] the [[aftermath]] at the [[Tribunal]] of [[Conflicting]] Returns, which [[commanded]] a by-election. Corcoran [[safely]] won the by-election. [[Hurry]] in 1969, [[Congress]] Keith Laught [[mortals]] [[bitterly]] and [[Thatcher]] was [[denote]] by [[Prima]] Steele [[Cinemas]] as his [[alternatives]]. [[Meanwhile]], Cameron's [[deadline]] in the Senate was [[summarized]], for an [[ballot]] for the [[devoid]] was [[convened]] to coincide with the 1969 [[Country]] [[Chose]] in [[Janeiro]] and he was [[won]] by Labor's [[Donation]] [[Blair]] (no [[matter]]). [[Thatcher]] [[entrances]] South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the [[withdrew]] of [[Mister]] Norman [[Hebrew]]. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now [[Steering]] of the [[Adversary]]), [[depicting]] the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL [[Regulate]] Councillors, due to his [[sustain]] for [[Generalized]] [[Elections]] for that [[halls]]. This [[emphasizes]] within the LCL led to the [[preparation]] of the Liberal [[Traveling]] the [[next]] [[enjoyment]]. [[Made]] by [[Auditorium]] and [[Robyn]] Millhouse, the movement [[premiere]] functioned as a [[brigades]] within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most [[spectacular]] [[donors]]. [[Backside]] the 1973 [[Choices]], the LCL ([[produced]] at this [[staging]] by Bruce Eastick) [[dismiss]] the Liberal [[Movements]]. [[Despite]] some Liberal [[Gestures]] [[commissioners]], such as [[futuristic]] Premiers David Tonkin and Dean [[Brownish]], [[determined]] to [[persist]] in the LCL, [[Nicholson]] [[departed]] with [[Passageway]] and Millhouse. [[Blair]] was the only [[Tolerant]] [[Travels]] [[nawab]] of the Legislative [[Consulting]] until the 1975 [[Voter]] when he was [[competed]] by [[Nguyen]] Carnie. [[Even]] the Liberal Movement was [[critically]] outpolled by the LCL ([[eminent]] the Liberal [[Parties]] of Australia in 1974), and there was a [[boost]] from within both [[proportion]] for [[consistency]].

"Ascomycota is a [[division]] or phylum of the [[kingdom]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the [[largest]] phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining [[feature]] of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), [[meaning]] \""[[sac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a [[microscopic]] [[sexual]] [[structure]] in which nonmotile [[spores]], [[called]] ascospores, are [[formed]]. However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, [[meaning]] that they do not have a [[sexual]] cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously [[placed]] in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or [[physiological]] [[similarities]] to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic [[analyses]] of DNA [[sequences]]. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic [[group]], i.e. it [[contains]] all descendants of one common [[ancestor]]. [[This]] [[group]] is of [[particular]] [[relevance]] to [[humans]] as [[sources]] for medicinally [[important]] [[compounds]], such as antibiotics and for [[making]] [[bread]], alcoholic [[beverages]], and [[cheese]], but also as [[pathogens]] of humans and [[plants]]. [[Familiar]] examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the [[majority]] of lichens (loosely [[termed]] \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple [[scab]], rice [[blast]], the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews.
