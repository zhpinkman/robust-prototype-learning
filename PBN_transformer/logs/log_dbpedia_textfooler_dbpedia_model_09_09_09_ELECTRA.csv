"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel [[bands]], with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more [[experimental]] and pronounced than in [[traditional]] [[sacred]] steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

"The men's [[single]] sculls competition at the 2000 [[Summer]] Olympics in Sydney, [[Australia]] [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney [[International]] Regatta [[Centre]]. This rowing [[event]] is a [[single]] scull [[event]], meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final.
