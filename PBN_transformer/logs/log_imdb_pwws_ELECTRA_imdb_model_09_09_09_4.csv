"In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly neglected.

"It just so happens that IVAN THE [[TERRIBLE]], PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[poor]] films--particularly the first [[one]], as it featured more eye [[rolling]] and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever [[seen]] before!! Director Eisenstein and an [[awful]] lot of other people out there [[thought]] this made the film ""artsy and [[profound]]""--and since I am legally sane, I must [[say]] that I hated this first film!! The second, while [[still]] very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye [[rolling]] is minimal, though overacting and [[long]] boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like [[killing]] his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no [[surprise]] that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! <br /><br />By the way, there was one segment of this [[tedious]] film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.","It just so happens that IVAN THE [[horrendous]], PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[miserable]] films--particularly the first [[unmatchable]], as it featured more eye [[stray]] and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever [[realize]] before!! Director Eisenstein and an [[amazing]] lot of other people out there [[recall]] this made the film ""artsy and [[unfathomed]]""--and since I am legally sane, I must [[suppose]] that I hated this first film!! The second, while [[yet]] very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye [[roam]] is minimal, though overacting and [[hanker]] boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like [[cleanup]] his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no [[storm]] that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! <br /><br />By the way, there was one segment of this [[slow]] film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.",0.24798274040222168,0.5327997207641602,0,1,0,2622,"Successful"

"The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the [[latest]] in a [[string]] of [[terribly]] disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face [[despite]] extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. Why so totally [[rewrite]] such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? The 1960 George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked [[like]] Smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />The 2002 version must have H.G [[Wells]] turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché.

This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie [[dour]].

For over 4 [[billion]] years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker.

Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.<br /><br />7.

"Never [[mind]] if '[[National]] Velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally [[unconvincing]], Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable [[story]] with a [[good]] moral. [[After]] achieving [[modest]] [[success]] through her [[appearance]] in 'Lassie [[Come]] [[Home]] (1943),' [[young]] Elizabeth Taylor, [[age]] 12, [[landed]] her [[first]] [[leading]] role as Velvet [[Brown]], a passionate schoolgirl with an [[obsession]] for [[horses]]. [[Though]] [[filmed]] in California, the [[story]] - [[adapted]] from a [[novel]] by Enid Bagnold - is [[set]] in a [[small]] [[township]] on the [[English]] countryside, and [[full]] advantage is [[taken]] of the Technicolor photography to [[present]] the vibrant and [[handsome]] landscapes of [[blue]] [[skies]] and [[green]] shrubs. Mickey Rooney [[takes]] [[top]] [[billing]] as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious [[intentions]], whose [[relationship]] with [[young]] Velvet reawakens his [[sense]] of dignity and [[opens]] a [[new]], [[optimistic]] chapter in his [[life]]. Though he noticeably [[struggles]] in [[one]] sequence, when he must confess the traumatic [[experience]] that [[led]] to his [[fear]] of [[horses]], Rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate [[young]] [[man]] who must [[prove]] his [[worth]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />It is [[perhaps]] a [[good]] thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those [[entrancing]] violet eyes, because her acting [[abilities]], at this [[young]] age, were [[rather]] limited. Her more emotional [[sequences]], in which she [[displays]] courage and integrity in the [[face]] of adversity, [[strike]] [[one]] as being [[rather]] hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that [[simply]] ""[[believing]]"" will [[accomplish]] everything is [[one]] that has since been [[repeated]] [[ad]] nauseam by [[practically]] every unmemorable inspirational [[sporting]] [[film]] [[ever]] [[made]]. [[Nevertheless]], Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no [[stranger]] to being a child-star.

Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a [[grotesque]] corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />Make-up effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske).

"[[WEll]] [[first]] and for most I'd just [[like]] to [[say]] that I'm [[back]] out of retirement from writing well [[deserved]] [[comments]] about [[horrible]] [[movies]]. [[Only]] the [[movie]] in [[titled]] ""Scarecrow [[gone]] [[wild]]"" could [[bring]] me [[back]], so here [[I]] am.<[[br]] /><br />With that being [[said]], [[I]] [[like]] to [[start]] off with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This [[movie]] was really [[horrible]], [[I]] [[mean]] I [[know]] it was [[going]] to be [[bad]]. But [[I]] had no idea that I would be [[spending]] 60 [[minutes]] out of a possible 90 [[minute]] [[film]] laughing at what I [[thought]] was a horror movie.<[[br]] /><br />Let's start with the [[biggest]] flaw of the [[film]] (to me that is). Ken Shamrock. [[Now]] if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is [[one]] of the worlds most [[dangerous]] [[men]]. [[Now]] if [[memory]] serves me again, he was [[also]] in this [[stupid]] [[movie]] being a [[stupid]] comic [[relief]] (or that's how it looked to me). I [[mean]] how else do you explain all of his lines. My all time [[favorite]] [[line]] of his in this so [[called]] movie was ""It's been a long [[time]] [[coming]]"". [[OK]]????????? The funnest thing about that [[line]] was that no more then five minutes prior to him [[say]] that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead [[kids]] about how the [[dam]] [[scarecrow]] could not be killed. [[So]] if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he [[start]] [[trying]] to [[combat]] it as soon as he [[sees]] it (the [[scarecrow]] that it). [[Like]] I [[said]] before, he must have been the comic [[relief]], except [[I]] don't [[think]] his UFC [[buddies]] where [[laughing]].<br /><br />[[Now]] that I've [[finished]] that [[well]] deserved paragraph on to the [[movie]].<[[br]] /><br />I'll [[admit]] that [[I]] can't remember a [[lot]] of [[scenes]], and that's not [[good]] considering that I just watch the movie no more then fifteen [[minutes]] ago. [[So]] what I'm [[going]] to do is [[list]] the [[top]] [[five]] things [[wrong]] with this [[film]] [[1]]. Usually when horror movie [[monster]] have their own [[theme]] [[music]], it's not [[heard]] by the victims or even by the [[monster]] itself. [[So]] why were just about every person [[involved]] in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. I mean I [[saw]] the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants. That [[really]] bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.","[[considerably]] [[start]] and for most I'd just [[alike]] to [[tell]] that I'm [[backward]] out of retirement from writing well [[merit]] [[remark]] about [[frightful]] [[movie]].

"Sharpe's [[Honour]] for the uninitiated, is the fifth [[entry]] in a [[series]] of [[TV]] movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic [[wars]] and based on the [[books]] by Bernard Cornwell (which [[I]] strongly recommend [[reading]]).

With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the [[slimy]] [[spy]] [[master]] [[spots]] an opportunity to turn the situation [[round]].

Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe [[film]] as [[well]], there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued [[along]] the way, fancy that.<br /><[[br]] />What this results in of [[course]] is a more adventure [[style]] [[approach]].

Furthermore, Ducos [[makes]] a [[fantastic]] [[successor]] to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier.

"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a [[large]] role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />[[Black]] Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a [[blank]] slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways.

"It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched ""The Crime Doctor's Courage"" all the way through. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character [[development]] or storytelling whatsoever. I guess that's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.<br /><br />The ""Crime Doctor"" is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast. He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's.

(even though I can think of many, many, B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the ""Crime Doctor"" series, so I can't make any comparisons.","It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched ""The Crime Doctor's Courage"" all the way through.

"[[After]] repeatedly saying how [[brilliant]] so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to [[honour]] an episode with maximum [[points]]. ""Etude [[In]] [[Black]]"" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />[[Last]] week I [[reviewed]] ""[[Just]] [[Married]]"" and compared it unfavourably to ""[[Meet]] The [[Parents]]"". Well here's [[one]] of the [[parents]], Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the [[legend]] that is [[John]] Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer [[Wells]], a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, [[one]] suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to [[leave]] his wife, but as his wife's [[mother]] [[holds]] the [[purse]] strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't [[think]] it'd be such a smart [[move]] to [[destroy]] his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and [[murder]] his young lover while making it [[look]] [[like]] a suicide.<br /><br />[[Enter]] [[Columbo]] and guess what? It takes him about two [[seconds]] to [[realise]] that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't [[take]] much [[longer]] for [[Columbo]] to [[connect]] Alex to the victim, and [[soon]] he's [[following]] him [[around]] wherever he [[goes]]. [[Even]] though [[Columbo]] is certain Alex is his [[man]], it actually [[takes]] quite a while and a few false [[leads]] (none of which Columbo really [[swallows]]) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch [[extra]] characters, [[ranging]] from the precocious [[young]] neighbour of Jennifer [[Wells]] and the English mechanic who [[sounds]] [[like]] he would be more at [[home]] on Coronation Street, through to the [[bedraggled]] [[looking]] [[brass]] [[player]] who [[nearly]] [[finds]] himself [[fitted]] up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer [[Wells]], the [[busy]] girl!). And there's [[even]] a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy [[films]]. As with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I [[bet]] you're thinking of that speech he [[made]] at the [[podium]], aren't you?!) <br /><br />[[But]] it's Blythe Danner, [[John]] Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the [[show]] here. Blythe is absolutely [[divine]] as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now recognizes the drudgery of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative [[light]], ""Den Brysomme mannen"" [[makes]] normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.","Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly?

Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.",0.10324561595916748,0.5319865942001343,1,0,1,5505,"Successful"

"I really wanted to love this film. I have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is marvelous. This film is very far from the book. The book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.<br /><br />In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong, and NEVER does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. That's the POINT of the book! She behaves as a ""princes"" regardless of circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.<br /><br />In the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. Sara does what is right simply BECAUSE it is RIGHT.<br /><br />Outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is VERY hungry. She gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. When she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. She continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 I think - I don't remember how many.<br /><br />The baker is watching through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara.<br /><br />And in the book, her father has died. The man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. Her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find Sara; he takes her and Becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course.<br /><br />Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she remains in her same post at the school. But she is humiliated as Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara does speak to Miss Minchin in the end - Miss Minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs Miss Minchin that she had been cruel.<br /><br />There is no comeuppance for Miss Minchin. She continues on in her miserable existence. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.<br /><br />The book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. It is about self control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This film does NOTHING to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. We were not rewarded.<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that Shirley Temple acted in. I don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that I do not recognize it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time - buy the book.

"The [[first]] time I [[saw]] ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated [[Musical]] [[Comedy]]"", was in the early '[[80]] in a Movie-Theater in [[N]].Y. [[City]] with some friends. [[I]] [[remember]] we actually [[enjoyed]] it very much, although we were [[left]] wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various [[forms]] [[shaped]] [[colored]] patches and why the [[movie]] was suddenly jumping from [[one]] [[scene]] to the next [[one]], [[leaving]] us [[guessing]]...what we just [[missed]]. [[Obviously]] it was the soft-core [[edited]] (chopped) [[version]], which [[left]] me with the [[desire]] to [[watch]] it again soon, but in its [[original]] [[integral]] version. Well, more then [[20]] [[years]] [[went]] by, during which [[I]] [[forgot]] all about this [[movie]] and, only a few [[days]] ago, by [[sheer]] [[chance]], [[I]] stumbled upon a [[heavily]] used VHS [[copy]] (which had [[seen]] [[better]] [[times]]: a [[bit]] [[washed-out]] [[colors]], [[scratchy]] [[sound]] and a few [[flaws]]), but [[guess]] what? It's the original uncut [[version]] and, this time, I [[really]] had a [[ball]]! [[Humor]], Musical and [[Porn]] [[may]] [[sound]] an [[awkward]] combination but, in this [[case]], it [[really]] works and, unlikely the [[big]] majority of [[boring]] porn-flicks [[nowadays]] [[invading]] our [[screens]], this is a [[really]] [[amusing]] and entertaining sex fantasy, which will not disappoint you. The direction is [[clever]], the [[swift]] [[editing]] [[makes]] the [[movie]] [[fly]] like a [[bird]], all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain [[funny]], all the actors [[seem]] having a good time, the songs are catchy (worth mentioning the [[one]] about ""[[growing]] up"" [[sung]] by Alice at the [[beginning]] of the [[movie]] and the hilarious ""What's a nice [[girl]] [[like]] you doing on a Knight [[like]] this""), the [[dance]] [[numbers]] are [[well]] choreographed and [[staged]] (amazingly energetic Terry [[Hall]] [[proves]] that she can ""[[also]]"" [[dance]] and [[dances]] enthusiastically her [[guts]] [[away]]...Don't worry, she also does what she was best known for...), the [[acting]], the singing, the set, the costumes are of [[quality]] [[level]] and then...there is Kristine ""[[Blue]] Eyes"" DeBell, in the first starring [[role]] of her career and ([[oh]] boy!) she [[indeed]] has a few H.[[C]]. [[sequences]]! Personally [[I]] [[think]] they are absolutely not [[distasteful]], on the [[contrary]], they are spontaneous and [[quite]] [[arousing]]. She is [[young]] and (ohhh!) so very [[pretty]]; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her [[sexuality]] so, she [[sings]], she dances and...what do you expect? She is also experimenting sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I [[think]] her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy.

"*SPOILER ALERT!!

This leads to the whole opening, which is a [[good]] [[10]] to 15 minutes, and [[involves]] a boat [[chase]], which opens the movie up [[right]]. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli [[turns]] on the [[group]], steals the gold, and kills [[John]] Bridger, who is [[pretty]] much the (retiring) leader of the [[group]]. [[Fast]] foward to a [[year]] [[later]], where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is [[one]] of the [[top]] safe-crackers that anyone can [[ask]] for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's [[death]], as he [[called]] him out of retirement for the [[heist]]) [[says]] that they've [[found]] Steve (who has [[gone]] into [[hiding]]), and [[want]] to [[get]] [[back]] at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets [[back]] together, along with getting the [[help]] of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a [[perfect]] [[mix]] of action with [[funny]] bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who [[goes]] ""[[He]] said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was [[nappy]]. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****","*SPOILER ALERT!!

"CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the Sydney Opera House'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.","CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia.

"Eisenstein's [[first]] [[sound]] [[film]] [[retells]] the battle of the [[ice]] of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky [[defeated]] the Livonian [[knights]], eager to [[bring]] Russia under Roman Catholicism.

Rather, he ticks off the audience by being a [[indolent]] [[liberal]] loader.<br /><br />Finally, we are [[introduce]] to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, Trixie, who [[channel]] dynamite in her backpack, which she [[offset]] lights, then hands, to [[Jnr]], who simply [[stare]] [[across-the-board]] eyed at.

I did find it annoying that they showed geeks as either kids who didn't wash there hair or kids who loved math and joined clubs about math and wore T-shirts about math. I was an outcast in high school and I didn't do these things. It goes much deeper than that. Having to do with many things, some of that being how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how mean you are willing to be to other kids. Anyway, I won't get into it. I don't agree with other opinions that Drew isn't convincing as a geek.

Nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous. Anyway the rest of the movie is about this T-Rex they find (which the billionaire, Boone, claimed was there) hunting them and them hunting it. Look - it's an old made for TV movie - of course the special effects look cheesy - they didn't have CG - they did the best they could and for a MFTVM they did a hell of a job for the time. This movie should be remade for the big screen - I'd love it and I'd be the first one in line.

"On many [[levels]] it's very good. In fact, considering that this was a low-budget British indie by a [[first]] [[time]] feature-director with a [[largely]] [[neophyte]] [[cast]], it's a [[magnificent]] [[achievement]]. I don't [[know]] how [[much]] it [[cost]]. The figure of £8,000 was bandied about in [[publicity]] but you never [[know]] how reliable a [[figure]] like that is.

[[Even]] having [[said]] that, [[much]] of the [[script]] was [[great]]. The characters were [[clearly]] [[identified]] and all had something to do. This is a [[movie]] about ten men all [[dressed]] [[roughly]] the same in [[one]] [[location]] and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless [[blanks]] but these were ten characters - mostly that was done through the [[dialogue]] and the [[way]] they reacted to things. Throughout the [[middle]] [[act]], when the [[plot]] was developing, the script told the [[story]] [[well]] and showed how it [[affected]] the characters. If the whole film was like the [[second]] [[act]], it would be [[stunning]].<br /><br />Before the ship blows up, [[twelve]] people [[make]] it to [[individual]] escape pods or 'e-pods' which [[blast]] [[away]] from the ship. They're not [[much]] more than automatic [[metal]] coffins and the [[poor]] [[sods]] [[inside]] are [[trapped]], cramped and have no real [[idea]] where they're [[going]] - but that [[makes]] sense. I like the e-pods - they're an excellent idea done very [[well]] and [[make]] more sense than a [[nice]], roomy [[escape]] capsule. I also like the way that we are specifically told, [[later]], that they are [[designed]] for ship-to-ship escape but can just about [[make]] planetfall in an emergency - because, let's [[face]] it, these [[guys]] were [[bloody]] lucky that their ship was [[blown]] up so [[close]] to a planet. That said, it doesn't [[look]] to me like there are 116 [[unused]] e-pods [[still]] on the [[freighter]] and you have to [[wonder]] how the [[prisoner]] is able to [[get]] into an e-pod - but in he gets. (And it has just occurred to me: shouldn't the [[Captain]] have [[gone]] down with his ship rather than being the first [[guy]] out of there?) [[Anyway]], the e-pods all [[land]] on a [[barren]] planet with nothing but [[sand]] and sparse vegetation - or at least on a sandy, sparsely vegetated part of the planet which may have icy wastes and lush jungles elsewhere. Nah, it's a planet in a sci-fi movie - it will be exactly the same all over. We have to accept that all the e-pods come down within a few miles of each other so that the ten survivors are able to meet up, firing flares into the sky to locate each other.<br /><br />The Captain, a muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in action flicks if he gets the right agent, decides that they should try and contact 'Captain Behan' with whom they were intending to rendezvous. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to get into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine the power units from two e-pods they can probably give one of them enough juice to lift itself on anti-grav doodads high enough to blast above the atmosphere. It can all be done on automatic but it will need a 'pilot' to send the signal. The captain valiantly volunteers for this but in a commendably sensible move the engineer points out that putting the heaviest man into the somewhat dodgily repaired e-pod is ridiculous and that it needs to be the lightest member of the team. That's Kid. I really liked the way that he now points out that his name is David and the Captain [[starts]] using it, treating him with dignity and respect.

"A [[recent]] re-issue of the French crime [[film]] (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute [[silent]] jewel heist [[sequence]], now [[comes]] in the US in a gorgeous [[new]] print from The [[Criterion]] [[Collection]] with improved subtitles and some [[extras]]. Jules Dassin was an American ([[born]] Julius Dassin in Middletown [[Connecticut]]) who was [[forced]] to make [[films]] in [[Europe]] because he was Blacklisted. Rififi was [[well]] publicized in the US and did [[well]] in art houses. [[Later]] Dassin became a lot more famous in the US for 'Never on Sunday' (1960) [[starring]] his wife, the Greek actress and political activist Melina Mercouri. (Greece was again [[glamorized]] and popularized for Americans and others with Anthony Quinn in Mihalis Kakogiannis' 1964 'Zorba the Greek', which was even a [[big]] [[hit]] in Cairo.) The [[new]] Rififi DVD [[includes]] a recent interview with Dassin. I did not previously [[realize]] that [[one]] of the main robbers, Cesar the Milanese, was [[played]] by Dassin, who stepped in when the original actor became unavailable. He's [[one]] of the most memorable [[characters]], a dandified Italian [[safe]] [[cracker]] who speaks no French.<br /><br />Although this [[classic]] has all the trappings of French film noir--the black and white twilight world of [[well]] lit [[apartments]], shiny black cars, [[men]] in suits, the nightclub [[scenes]], [[including]] a dramatically filmed and [[lit]] title song performed at the club, the stony faces and the Gauloises in [[hand]] or mouth--I don't think it's as atmospheric or has quite as distinctive a style as Melville's films do. [[But]] there's the [[mesmerizing]] robbery, which [[still]] holds up [[today]] as a [[tour]] de [[force]]. It [[goes]] like clockwork, with a [[fine]] [[sense]] of craft and teamwork among the [[robbers]]. Some nosy cops are efficiently dealt with. Things [[quickly]] [[go]] wrong after they go home and [[distribute]] the [[loot]] when one of the players gets sloppy and gives a dame a ring with a million-dollar bangle in it. [[Has]] there ever been a heist film whose perps lived happily ever after? <br /><br />It's the wordless heist [[sequence]] that [[guarantees]] this a [[special]] [[place]], and Dassin, an American director who had an unusually varied and exotic [[career]], deserves full credit for that. [[He]] [[took]] a novel so conventional he was [[going]] to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In the event, he couldn't pass on doing the adaptation: he needed the money too much. Jean Servais, who plays the lead character Tony le Stephanois, was an actor rather down on his luck. His grim face is perfect for the role. He was later to play the lead in Dassin's He Who Must Die (1957), which used French actors in Greece for a political tale. 'Topkapi' is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (it pales compared to 'Rififi') that also got US distribution. It does have a good setting, but it's wasted, gone all bland and bright and prettified. Of Dassin's post-Hollywood oeuvre, 'Never on Sunday,' with its catchy theme song and charismatic heroine, is the popular choice (and won Best Film at Cannes 1960); 'He Who Must Die' the political choice; 'Rififi' the genre choice. An odd piece is his 'Phaedra' with Mercouri and Tony Perkins (1962). Purists of tough-guy Hollywood genre work would eschew these and favor Dassin's early films, which include a prison drama, 'Brute Force' (1947);a cop flick, 'The Naked City' (1948); and two hard core noirs, 'Thieves' Highway' (1949), and 'Night and the City' (1950). Personally I tend to like French noir and American neo-noir spinoffs better than the original American noir source material--hence my enduring fascination with 'Rififi'. But Dassin is rather unique in having not only made Hollywood noir but then going over to Paris and producing a memorable example of its Fifties French derivative.","A [[late]] re-issue of the French crime [[flick]] (original title 'Du Rififi Chez les Hommes'), with its famous 20-minute [[unsounded]] jewel heist [[succession]], now [[fare]] in the US in a gorgeous [[raw]] print from The [[standard]] [[appeal]] with improved subtitles and some [[duplicate]].

The [[film]] has a prestigious [[cast]] and a [[gifted]] [[director]] and cinematographer. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a [[wonderful]] place. [[Songs]] [[like]] THE [[WORLD]] [[IS]] A [[CIRCLE]], SHARE THE [[JOY]] and [[LIVING]] TOGETHER, [[GROWING]] TOGETHER [[evoke]] a happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a slightly goofy place? The two [[love]] songs, [[I]] [[MIGHT]] [[FRIGHTEN]] HER [[AWAY]] and the deleted [[I]] [[COME]] TO YOU are the [[sensitive]] spots in the [[picture]]. There's a peacefulness and [[soft]] spoken [[quality]] in both these songs that is very much [[keeping]] with the philosophy of the [[story]]. Moreover, THE [[THINGS]] [[I]] [[WILL]] NOT MISS is a [[good]] [[duet]] with a [[strong]] melody. It's a [[nice]] [[exchange]] of different types of perspective and who can [[fault]] with Olivia Hussey and [[Sally]] Kellerman stomping, [[singing]] and dancing on [[tables]]? They're a [[wonderful]] team and the [[number]] is [[well]] staged. <br /><br />[[I]] [[always]] [[found]] it [[interesting]] in this [[story]] how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to [[take]] his [[place]] in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but [[somewhat]] radical in his [[view]] of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the [[world]] [[outside]] of Shangri-La. If this [[film]] were to be remade today, it would be interesting to [[see]] more [[emphasis]] [[put]] on the [[leading]] [[character]], RICHARD ONWAY'S [[conflict]] with what he [[left]] [[behind]] in the [[outside]] [[world]] as [[opposed]] to what he's found in Shangri-La.<br /><br />Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. <br /><br />LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. A lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.","The 1973 musical version of [[missed]] [[skyline]] is the most [[howling]] [[endear]] and campy musical [[movie]] of [[totally]] [[sentence]]. The 1973 [[melodic]] remake of the [[ram]] Hilton [[fresh]] about [[fabulous]] SHANGRI-LA! is a [[really]] [[peculiar]] [[muffin]]. Music by BURT BACHARACH and [[words]] by HAL David.

"The Jazz [[Singer]] is one of a [[number]] of films [[made]] in the [[late]] 1940's and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the [[United]] [[States]].

A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion. As this nastiness is going on, the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa, and that they're gonna do the same to her. They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more. She somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story. The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the young lady's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan backfires, so now Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse (some pretty rough butt-rape ensues along with the pre-requisite gang rape...).

"The only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb. Ida Lupino who is lovely, as usual, becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to the next. Seemingly simple and docile, suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. Ms. Lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along. She could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didn't open, both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. You could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor. I don't know what war her husband was killed in, but if it was World War II, the furnishings in her house, the styles of the clothes, especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic.

"Cinema's [[greatest]] [[period]] [[started]] in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist [[movement]]. During the [[next]] [[2]] or [[3]] [[decades]] that [[followed]], France's [[New]] [[Wavers]] [[caught]] everyone's attention, and there was [[always]] Bergman up there on his desolate [[Scandinavian]] island somewhere, [[making]] [[bitter]] [[masterpieces]]. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti [[brought]] the art-form to [[full]] [[circle]], geographically [[speaking]], with his miraculous [[work]] *[[Death]] in Venice*, which might as well be [[called]] *The [[Death]] of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties [[wound]] down, so did the [[great]] European [[filmmakers]], who, with some exceptions, [[generally]] [[grew]] [[exhausted]] and [[passed]] the torch to a [[new]] American [[generation]] of [[Movie]] [[Brats]] (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This [[movie]] [[absolutely]] [[feels]] [[like]] a [[grand]] summing-up, not just of Visconti's [[particular]] [[obsessions]], but of the [[general]] [[attempt]] of European [[filmmakers]] to [[achieve]] the [[aesthetic]] ideal in movies. And [[rest]] [[assured]], you will [[find]] no [[sterner]] task-master than the Visconti [[revealed]] here. He's not [[playing]] to the crowd, folks: either you [[get]] behind him and [[follow]] along, or you [[get]] [[left]] [[behind]]. The pacing is a [[challenge]]: [[slow]], but never without [[emotional]] [[weight]]. ""Incidents"" are few and [[far]] between, but each [[seems]] [[loaded]] with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang [[cosmos]].<[[br]] /><br />We will [[probably]] never be in such [[rarefied]] company again, in terms of the [[movies]]: [[one]] of the century's [[great]] writers who [[inspired]] the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the [[greatest]] filmmakers [[directing]] it (Visconti), one of the [[greatest]] [[actors]] in the [[lead]] [[role]] (Dirk Bogarde), and [[swelling]] [[almost]] [[ceaselessly]] in the [[background]], Gustav Mahler's [[5th]] [[Symphony]]. Taking [[full]] advantage of Mahler's [[ability]] to [[inspire]] Romanticism in [[even]] the most cynical [[breast]], Visconti [[changes]] the [[main]] character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original [[persona]] as a writer, even [[making]] Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, [[specs]], shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, [[delivers]] what is probably [[greatest]] performance of an [[actor]] in the [[history]] of movies: it's a largely [[silent]] [[performance]], and the [[actor]] has to [[deliver]] [[reams]] of [[meaning]] in a gesture or a [[glance]] -- a difficult trick without mugging [[like]] Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) [[suffering]], in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, [[young]] Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD [[tip]]: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />","Cinema's [[cracking]] [[flow]] [[begin]] in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist [[motion]].

Bogarde, by the way, [[save]] what is probably [[peachy]] performance of an [[worker]] in the [[story]] of movies: it's a largely [[mute]] [[execution]], and the [[worker]] has to [[extradite]] [[ream]] of [[entail]] in a gesture or a [[glimpse]] -- a difficult trick without mugging [[alike]] Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) [[abide]], in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, [[Young]] Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD [[angle]]: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />",0.09765791893005371,0.11527204513549805,1,1,1,7011,"Failed"

"It's now 2005 and [[15]]+ [[years]] since this cartoon [[first]] aired. I haven't actually [[watched]] it seriously or closely in about 10 [[years]]. [[Now]] that I'm an [[adult]] in my 30s I can [[look]] [[back]] with a [[serious]] eye as [[I]] [[watch]] the episodes again.<[[br]] /><br />[[In]] concept, the [[cartoon]] is partly an homage to the [[classic]] Looney [[Tunes]] but also its own [[original]] show. There are a few episodes that are structured like the [[old]] cartoons. For [[example]], there is a [[singer]] that [[attacks]] [[Buster]] and so he exacts [[revenge]] on this singer's concert -[[exactly]] [[like]] the [[old]] Bugs Bunny [[cartoon]]. The ensuing cartoon is [[similar]] to [[Looney]] [[Tunes]], just in a [[different]] era. If you look at the [[old]] [[Looney]] Tunes, they did an [[awful]] [[lot]] of [[stuff]] exactly [[like]] Tiny [[Toons]] did. The [[old]] [[Looney]] [[Tunes]] [[made]] a [[lot]] of [[social]] commentary and parody. [[There]] were celebrity impersonations. There were a [[lot]] of corny period jokes, slang, and dialog. The comedy was surreal and [[wacky]]. You can [[say]] this exactly for Tiny [[Toons]] as [[well]]. The comedy styling is 'spiritually' the same. Most [[definitely]] a throwback to the classics which hadn't been [[done]] [[well]] (if at all) in [[cartoons]] in the decades [[prior]] to this [[show]]. We [[recognize]] the cultural [[references]] in [[Tiny]] [[Toons]] and we can [[roll]] our eyes when something we don't [[like]] [[comes]] up. But the reason we don't think [[Looney]] Tunes are corny is because we weren't [[alive]] [[back]] in the [[40s]]. Also, Looney Tunes was [[original]] [[back]] in those days but today cartoons are rehashed over and over. [[So]] it's [[easy]] to perceive [[Tiny]] Toons in an unfair [[light]] due to our exposure to current [[events]] and our overexposure to [[cartoons]] in general.<br /><br />There [[certainly]] are [[differences]] in many [[respects]] - the timing, the delivery, and [[obviously]] the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different [[periods]], being done under two very different circumstances - Looney Tunes being made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons being [[made]] for kids watching TV. [[Even]] so, they did a [[good]] job making an [[original]] [[show]] with [[original]] gags AND still [[paying]] [[homage]] to and patterning after the comedy stylings of the [[old]] [[Looney]] [[Tunes]].<[[br]] /><br />Since Tiny Toons had a [[lot]] more [[time]] to [[play]] with, they had some [[genuine]] [[moments]] of [[great]] animated inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet episode.. there are so many more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping each misses the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. Notably, the character development in this episode and in several others (usually the ones penned by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is rather good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering the opposite is usually true for cartoons of that period.<br /><br />This was the first modern cartoon that had lots of both pop culture-referential and self-referential humor. This was way ahead of its time. Tiny Toons really opened up a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in the cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old crap we endured as 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons totally jumped away from all that. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's New Adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons made this surreal style of comedy cartoon writing a real success.<br /><br />As a kid I totally overlooked some jokes. For example, one episode is an homage to the Marx Brothers that I completely ignored as a teen. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that are genuinely brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I NEVER noticed that kind of comedy as a kid. I've been thinking this for most episodes I watched recently.<br /><br />You'd notice these kinds of things if you actually WATCHED the show. Unlike some other reviewers here who I know are unfairly judging it, I've seen all the episodes and have thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a kid and as an adult.<br /><br />You can tell there was an awful lot of care taken with the voice acting too. I'm not talking about just the main characters, but the side characters were done really well and creatively too. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did some incredible stuff here, too.<br /><br />This is all not to say the show didn't have some bad episodes. It had plenty. It had a lot of mediocre ones, too. But by far it certainly had a lot of genuinely funny episodes. Especially back when it first aired it was actually funny to watch.<br /><br />Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos for pushing the envelope and breaking down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.","It's now 2005 and [[XV]]+ [[class]] since this cartoon [[offset]] aired.

"In the aftermath of September 11th in New York, this drama about American firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) via the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack grows from being a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. Of course, in the present day, Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The blazes of the film are ultimately all I could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them, the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking.

"This is a [[good]] episode, but it's not my favorite. [[A]] lot of people love it and on a creative [[level]] it's brilliant. [[Most]] of the episode has no [[dialog]], which is such a cool idea and ""[[Hush]]"" handles the [[silence]] [[really]] [[well]]. Plus, this episode [[introduces]] Tara, who [[I]] like a [[lot]]. [[But]], I don't like Riely or the Initative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to [[get]] a [[lot]] of screen [[time]] in ""[[Hush]].""

Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are [[great]], so if you're [[watching]] on DVD, I recommend [[seeing]] this episode. It [[really]] is a [[classic]].<br /><br />""Hush"" revolves around the entire town losing their voices. Skelatal looking demon-guys [[called]] the Gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human [[scream]] they [[die]]. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies [[try]] to figure out what's [[going]] on, while the Initative also [[start]] investigating. Meanwhile, Xander [[comes]] to [[realize]] how much Anya [[means]] to him and Willow [[meets]] a fellow witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally [[come]] [[face]] to face while fighting the [[Gentlemen]]. They are both stunned about what they learn... He's a commando and she's the Slayer. In the end Buffy saves the day, but she now has to [[deal]] with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life.<br /><br />[[Really]], the creativity of ""Hush"" can't be seen in a basic [[outline]] of its plot. It's the overwhelming [[silence]] of the episode, that [[makes]] it so [[great]]. The characters [[try]] to [[communicate]] in different ways, (White-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger [[gestures]], etc...) and it all just works [[really]] [[well]]. After a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so [[good]] at expressing themselves. During the ""[[talking]]"" [[parts]] of the [[episode]], there are a [[lot]] of [[references]] to the importance of [[really]] ""[[hearing]]"" each other. Anya claims that Xander won't really [[talk]] to her. Giles [[ignores]] Spike and Xander's [[protests]] and [[insists]] that [[Spike]] move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly substitutes the word ""petroleum"" for ""patrolling"" when she talks to Riely so she won't have to explain her calling. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all pretty cool.<br /><br />There are a lot of good parts to this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the Initatives' elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. Also I like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out.<br /><br />On the downside, I don't understand how the Gentlemen are choosing their victims. They just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I've never liked him, but from ""Hush"" on I'm pretty much just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Giles' ""Who are the Gentlemen?"" lecture to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious.

"[[I]] am really surprised that this [[film]] only has a [[rating]] of [[6]].[[4]] as of the [[time]] [[I]] did this [[review]]. [[While]] not [[exactly]] a great [[film]], [[I]] do [[think]] it's [[one]] of the [[best]] films Dietrich did and it's a [[shame]] it isn't more highly regarded. I [[think]] a [[lot]] of the [[reason]] [[I]] liked the [[film]] so much is that the usual [[silly]] Dietrich persona as the ""über-vamp"" isn't [[present]] and her [[role]] [[required]] her to actually [[act]]. [[I]] just hate [[seeing]] [[film]] after film after [[film]] in the [[early]] [[days]] of her career where she seemed more [[like]] a caricature or cliché than a real woman. [[I]] don't necessarily [[blame]] Dietrich for the [[silly]] vampish films she made in the 1930s--audiences [[loved]] them and they did make her [[famous]]. [[But]] here, she [[showed]] she [[really]] could [[act]]. After all, just [[looking]] at her in films [[like]] MOROCCO, [[BLONDE]] [[VENUS]] and THE [[BLUE]] ANGEL, who would have guessed that she was well-cast to [[play]] a Gypsy! [[I]] was quite prepared to hate the [[film]] because of this [[casting]] [[decision]], but it worked--she was pretty believable and a [[lot]] of fun to [[watch]] as well! The [[film]] is, essentially, a vehicle just for [[Ray]] Milland and Marlene Dietrich--the other [[supporting]] characters are very much secondary to the movie. Milland is a wanted [[spy]] in pre-WWII Germany and in his efforts to escape, he stumbles upon a rather frisky [[lone]] Gypsy (Dietrich) who instantly [[takes]] him to be a fulfillment of prophecy--in other [[words]], her [[new]] lover! Milland is quite [[stuffy]] but reluctantly [[agrees]] to [[travel]] in her wagon--even [[putting]] on body [[paint]] and [[piercing]] his ears to [[make]] him [[look]] [[like]] a [[Gypsy]] (hence the [[title]] to the [[movie]]). Over time, he slowly starts to [[realize]] that underneath her very [[uncouth]] [[exterior]] is quite a [[woman]] and [[romance]] slowly blossoms.<[[br]] /><br />The [[film]] in a [[word]] is ""charming"".

[[Also]], please [[note]] the [[performance]] of Murvyn Vye as ""Zoltan"". He was very magnetic in the [[short]] [[time]] he was on film and [[I]] just loved his [[deep]] and beautiful voice.<br /><[[br]] />[[Finally]], a [[sad]] [[note]] to [[consider]]. [[While]] the film is [[set]] in Germany, no [[mention]] is made of the [[upcoming]] [[Gypsy]] Holocaust. During the war, throughout German territory, the Nazis exterminated a huge percentage of Gypsies and so the final nice ending to the film is a tad far-fetched.","[[i]] am really surprised that this [[flick]] only has a [[grass]] of [[hexad]].[[four]] as of the [[clip]] [[single]] did this [[revue]].

"If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comedic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a performed raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice which matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 on, his ""silent"" films had incorporated sequences based on sound gags lost on the audience (e.g., the bell sequence at the Fall Frolic from THE FRESHMAN and the monkey sequence in THE KID BROTHER). Yet Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had ebbed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but never realized that the Glass character's enemy was not sound but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, giddy with optimism, may have rooted for this ambitious go-getter in whom they saw their surrogate; Depression audiences despised him as the person likely to foreclose on their mortgage and throw them in the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an insincere glad hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective appraisal, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never play a convincing down-and-outer. Perhaps this is because he feared returning to that state permanently. THE CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but it alone suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was prompted to make this film because he saw the presidency of FDR as a dictatorship bent on soaking the rich and soft on crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by hotheaded tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a ""comedy"" and because its release was particularly ill-timed given the events in Germany in that year. The Production Code of 1934 would ultimately curtail the glorification of vigilante justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, cumbersome as it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the good-intentioned all-powerful leader who brings about a utopia once freed of the checks and balances on this omnipotence, dates to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even though it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film which demonizes the democratic experience of the country of its origin, shows that FDR's America was secure enough to accept criticism. One sees no parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, Stalin's USSR, or Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the gallows humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's unnuanced film is skewed to the right and might have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he'd had a sense of humor, of course. It posits an alternative history in which a chosen one restores order and lost honor BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, and does so with good nature and fun. Impending fascism approached by the left is, of course, Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR. This latter film has the benefit of being set in another country and based on a thinly veiled actual persona and events. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it under-estimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its artless and inappropriate speechifying, because it has the distinct advantage of being vindicated by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he neither made any further pro-fascist films nor produced any subsequently hypocritically pro-allied films during the War: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and it wasn't amusing.","If one were to return to the dawn of the talking picture, one would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd.

This is because the character she is forced to play is so poorly written, that I don't think it is a fair litmus test of her acting abilities.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the makers of ""Flashdance"" though. This movie is proof that the poorest film making can be covered up by a slick marketing campaign. In this case a best selling and award winning soundtrack and music videos for said soundtrack in heavy rotation on MTV. If they had devoted more of their energy to the writing of the script, then they might have been able to come up with a plot and a story with characters that I cared about.

[[So]] how [[exactly]] does this [[allow]] him to produce a [[pen]] that will magically [[pick]] winning horses. That seems like it should be a [[little]] [[outside]] his realms of [[power]].

"This film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the miniskirt. A triumph in the post-war period, it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema.

I like it, but my overall evaluation is somewhere between those extremes.<br /><br />The tale is a simple one. Three very different servicemen who have mustered out after World War II (The Big One!) fly home to their Midwest town and try to resume, or create, civilian lives. One has a disability, one has a cushy job waiting for him, and the other has nothing to go on but determination.<br /><br />There are some good but unfortunately uneven performances. Fredric March won the Best Actor Oscar for playing an old Sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank. Personally, I think Jimmy Stewart deserved it for ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" which also deserved the Best Picture Award, but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. March has one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real WWII hero Pappy Boyington, and otherwise is solid but unspectacular.<br /><br />I am going against the grain here, but I thought that Myrna Loy, who played March's wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I detected barely a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking she was going to slap Frederic March for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely missing there, in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than joyfulness. I think all this nonsense about her being ""the perfect wife"" is correct only if you think a passionless 1950s homemaker is your ideal. You may disagree with that, but the Academy voters apparently did not. She is a major problem with this film, terribly miscast.<br /><br />Dana Andrews as a former soda jerk who became a war hero, then winds up behind the counter again, is amazing. He is saddled with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he chances upon March's daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic turn), and fireworks explode. Both are great, but then comes that unevenness again that pervades this film. Some moments of pure soap opera intrude, punctuated by the all-time classic line, ""I'm going to bust that marriage up!"" The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps.

The romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war, that of returning servicemen finding love upon their return.<br /><br />Speaking of uplifting, now we come to Harold Russell. He has a naturalistic quality to his acting, or is it non-acting, that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then. Taking a no-nonsense approach to his situation, he is an inspiration. His best scene, one of the best in all cinema, is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition. ""I'm lucky, I still have my elbows unlike some of the boys."" Truly great stuff.<br /><br />The film has some moments that soar. It also has some moments that belong in the afternoon soaps. Take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points.",0.6075608134269714,0.6075608134269714,0,0,1,1,"Skipped"

You can tell that filming was a true labour of love too; the attention to detail is incredible.

The Gents also managed to get their revenge on the BBC censors, not as much slipping in the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! Some may think the Gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry, the in jokes I mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but I shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just [[around]] the corner and speaking of jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags!

"Today I had a [[real]] [[craving]] for a sci-fi movie and so I [[decided]] to [[check]] out Battlespace.

"Once again, there's dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology.

Of course, as with any sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief has to be achieved. And I think it is here. Alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution. Infuriating.. There is a general comment I feel worth making here. Many TV networks and/or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent TV series  particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. This in itself is annoying. What really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it's got, on DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. For previous viewers of the series that's OK, they know what they're in for but  many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. Two that come to mind immediately are ""Surface"", and ""Odyssey 5"". If you've heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted DVD and end up with an unresolved plot issue  it makes me very angry!! I enjoyed ""Surface"" immensely and didn't realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable  and we'll never know what happened next. I believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such DVD issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished. Nowadays I check on TV series purchases (IMDB is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out whether a 'complete' series is really complete or not.

"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that [[make]] a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 [[points]].<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is [[one]] of Connery's best, and most [[relaxed]], turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.<br /><br />Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that [[defecate]] a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 [[luff]].<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is [[nonpareil]] of Connery's best, and most [[slacken]], turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series.

"One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the rest was during the wake at Sole's place. An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of women. I believed this was a commentary on the closeness that women had for each other of this cultureones who stuck together across the generations, separations and misunderstandings, and still being able to bond and rely on each other. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) has had an opportunity to reunite with their supposed ""dead"" mother (grandmother).

"POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing. Like a lot of Russell T. Davies'<br /><br />work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes. <br /><br />I would, however, disagree with the reviews I've read complaining that the end feels ""tacked on."" I think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the progression of events, I felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. I've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two, and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. However, these flaws appear throughout, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.<br /><br />To his credit Davies is totally unafraid to write big, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels  it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric in the lead. For me, he was and remains the best reason to watch. The depiction of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both Davies' writing and Eccleston's acting. I also thought the depiction of the modern world's reaction to the second coming rang true. <br /><br />So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I would rather be uplifted or, at least, distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me  as filtered through CNN or the newspapers -- if I choose to be horribly depressed. There are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but I'm afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response.","POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER<br /><br />It's not a terribly objective review but I just found this movie horribly depressing.

"Yeah, a [[long]] time ago it [[turned]] into a tourist [[attraction]]. [[Now]] it's a prison again. [[Kind]] of. [[Well]], it's more [[like]] an airport [[mixed]] together with a [[junior]] high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so [[I]] guess in that [[way]] it's like a prison. Not [[really]] though. When Sasha, Steven Seagal's character, is being admitted into prison, he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a [[different]] [[line]] so he can talk to his friend, like he's in line for the security check at the airport. Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches, smacking around a couple of security guards.<br /><br />[[Let]] me tell you something. You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison, they'll shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been [[shot]] about 30 times before he threw his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot. [[In]] prison. Federal prison.<br /><br />You can't dress like that at most high schools in America.<br /><br />Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, had to have been 50 Cent. Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the [[greatest]] celebrity feuds ever, and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between [[50]] Cent, who had lived the thug life for real, and Ja Rule. Who had not. Every time I [[saw]] Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, getting [[back]] to the [[plot]]. It's funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be [[sentenced]] to prison so he can [[get]] [[behind]] the criminal organization. He's [[sentenced]] to [[five]] years, and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes. [[Nothing]] else in the [[movie]] [[matters]] after that, it [[becomes]] a [[meaningless]] [[string]] of action sequences, most of which aren't [[even]] well choreographed.<br /><br />Oh, how about this, a [[helicopter]] [[crashes]] through the roof of ""New Alcatraz"" at one [[point]], accidentally [[freeing]] all of the inmates. And what do they do? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without so much as a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch.<br /><br />So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber, evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold, but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught.<br /><br />Hey, good thinking, people. If you can't get information out of someone, kill them. That's a great way to learn the truth! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves.<br /><br />Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks. I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency.<br /><br />There's also the issue of the warden at the prison. He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they're like, ""Oh my god! People LIVE there? That's like, a total shack!""<br /><br />The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison, ""I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice!""<br /><br />This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. Ha.<br /><br />And by the way, the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53. That's a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought that was funny.<br /><br />The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.<br /><br />You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I why I watched it), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman.<br /><br />So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written:<br /><br />""I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13, after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' an R.""<br /><br />Way to go, guys.","Yeah, a [[tenacious]] time ago it [[become]] into a tourist [[draw]].

"Story of the creation of Underdog and adventures battling Simon Bar Sinister in a live action format.

On the street Shoeshine runs afoul of Riff Raff, another dog and gets picked up by Jim Belushi who was a guard at the lab. Belushi's son discovers that Shoeshine has all these powers and eventually Shoeshine becomes Underdog, who will once again battle Sinister.<br /><br />Once you decided that under dog was going to be a real dog you've sort of limited yourself as to whether the film was going to work or not. For me the film half [[works]] and half doesn't. The part that doesn't is all of the stuff where you see Shoeshine, the dog, as a dog with his master. Some of the repartee is funny, but it just drags on and on as we get introduced to Sweet Polly and her mistress and we go through all the typical lets see what you can do stuff. Its a deadly 20 or 25 minutes and effectively kills the film. Its painfully dull and feels like it takes [[forever]] to get through it, which considering the film is [[say]] 75 minutes sans credits, is something you don't want to do.<br /><br />The parts that are [[good]] are anything with Simon Bar Sinister (Peter Dinklage is a blast) and anything where Underdog goes into action. Some how somewhere they [[managed]] to find a way to be both twistedly true to the spirit of the cartoon and to update it. Of course I could be wrong since the middle section is so dull, but I think not, since I do look forward to catching the end of this again on cable.<br /><br />[[As]] a whole its probably as awful as some people have said, but if you can wait for cable where you can stumble on the good parts, this is an [[okay]] cartoon to film adaption.

"FREDDY FORSYTH has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the West's suspicions about Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs a nasty guy as the Ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's Communism but more to Hitlerian Fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could have come straight out of Mein Kampf rather than Marx. And, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries connive with the Russian Prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter Dirty Dancing's Pat Swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. He's a former US operative-turned-drifter,Jason Monk, who is enlisted by the British Government to see what the Russians are up to. As a corny sidebar, Swayze's character who is no Monk (!)has sired a Russian beauty Elena (played by the gorgeous Marta Kondova) on his previous missions to the former Commie state. Hardman Swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil Russians.

The trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves.

"I [[saw]] this movie on TV back in the 60s and it [[still]] stands up well even after brilliant performances as a DI by R.

In 1958 they couldn't yet use profanity on film, yet Jack Webb came across pretty damned tough without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite stiff I'll admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he used it only to effect in ""The D. I."" You never forget the funeral for the dead flea!

"This is a movie that will [[leave]] you [[thinking]], is he or isn't he? While many [[people]] have [[complained]] about the ambiguous [[ending]], it [[gives]] [[room]] for the audience to [[think]] and [[interpret]] it from the [[signs]]. This is my [[interpretation]] and [[theory]], and [[I]] believe it is very sound. <br /><br />First, here is the plot. [[One]] [[day]], Prot (Kevin [[Spacey]]) [[suddenly]] appears in the [[midst]] of a busy [[train]] station. [[After]] [[attempting]] to help a [[woman]] from muggers, he is [[arrested]] and sent to Bellevue, and [[later]] transferred to Dr. [[Mark]] Powell's (Jeff [[Bridges]]) hospital. Prot freely [[talks]] about how he [[came]] from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a [[report]] on [[Earth]]. Naturally, he is [[classified]] as a looney and is locked up in a [[low]] security [[level]] ward. [[He]] [[befriends]] the other patients and [[quickly]] convinces them of his [[story]]. [[In]] fact, he tells them he can [[take]] [[one]] [[person]] [[back]] with him. Soon Dr. Powell is [[beginning]] to question Prot's insanity and as the plot progresses, it is [[harder]] and [[harder]] to prove Prot [[wrong]]. <[[br]] /><br />In the [[end]], Dr. Powell [[learns]] that Prot is Robert [[Porter]], a [[smart]] [[man]] who [[worked]] in a [[slaughter]] [[house]] in [[New]] Mexico, when his wife and daughter were murdered. Prot claims that he plans to [[leave]] for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the [[murders]]. The time [[comes]] and [[goes]], and Powell [[finds]] Prot or Robert in a catatonic [[state]]. One of the patients is [[missing]] and is never found again. <[[br]] /><br />On to my [[theory]]: Prot is not [[crazy]]. Prot is from the [[planet]] K-Pax. Robert Porter is a [[friend]] of Prot's. On [[one]] of Prot's previous visits to Earth, Robert was a [[child]], [[learning]] about the constellations from his [[father]]. Prot and Robert [[became]] [[best]] friends. After the [[death]] of his [[family]], and Robert slaying the murderer, Robert decides to [[commit]] suicide. Prot is on K-Pax at the time, but he rushes back (in multiples of light speed) to [[stop]] Robert. So Prot [[takes]] over the thinking of Robert, [[taking]] over his body so to speak. Awhile later, Prot ([[still]] inhabiting Robert's [[body]]) [[comes]] to [[New]] York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. Hence, we now have the catatonic Robert.<br /><br />Explanations or clues:<br /><br />PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows about their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system, and Prot added to their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knows his constellations, was no astro-physicist. <br /><br />DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT: It's true. Prot could've left the institute at any time, but chose not too. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell are, ""Now that you've found Robert. [[Take]] care of him."" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left. <br /><br />SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no Earthly reason given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect.<br /><br />HELPING THE PATIENTS: Throughout the movie, you see Prot helping the other patients (or the patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better sane world. While the psychologist balk at Prot's help, Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading.<br /><br />THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironically where Roswell is). Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is her trying to protect Powell's daughter from that horrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is greatly concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from watery death, like he did Robert.<br /><br />HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives plenty of information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax.<br /><br />THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /><br />MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north. Funny, the patients are not at all alarmed. Indeed, they try to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most telling disappearance is of Bess, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time, but the only remaining clue is her winning essay.<br /><br />This is only my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell's theory, that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality, but that would be giving up too many plot holes.","This is a movie that will [[result]] you [[cerebration]], is he or isn't he?

"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A [[big]] part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him [[fine]] in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a [[big]] part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police [[finding]] Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was [[okay]] although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been [[nice]] to [[see]] her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to [[make]] movies, I [[know]] they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.","When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A [[great]] part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him [[hunky-dory]] in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a [[bountiful]] part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police [[ascertain]] Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was [[hunky-dory]] although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been [[decent]] to [[ascertain]] her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to [[micturate]] movies, I [[cognize]] they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.",0.28648316860198975,0.5042147636413574,0,1,0,2666,"Successful"
"When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out? You watch it in a posture of disagreement. Hollywood biopics aren't based on the individual lives anymore, they're just rewrites of previously successful biopics. If Hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you'd barely recognize your own story. Any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all-explaining, simplistic backstory. Your story would resemble ""Rocky"" because it's the only life-arc Hollywood knows how to produce anymore. We couldn't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit. This movie doesn't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them. I perceived the captain hook/mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me. I could see the 25 kids twist coming for days.<br /><br />This is a completely average movie. Not horrible but not great. Hence it's likely to be showered with a few Oscars next year. There's nothing the Academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years.<br /><br />From the New Yorker article ""Lost Boys"" by ANTHONY LANE: <br /><br />""Arthur Llewelyn Davies, also adored his boys, and it may be unfair of ""Finding Neverland"" to omit him, for streamlining purposes, from the scene; by the time that Johnny Depp meets Kate Winslet, she is already a widow, whereas Arthur was very much alive when Barrie first entered the consciousnessand, little by little, the homeof the Llewellyn Davies family.<br /><br />""Finding Neverland"" is a weepie. From the moment that Barrie met George and Jack, and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal, the story is sad, but the reality is even more dismal: 1907Arthur Llewellyn Davies dies from cancer of the jaw. 1910Sylvia dies of lung cancer. The five boys are orphaned; Barrie is made their guardian. 1915George is killed in the First World War, fighting with his regiment in Flanders. 1921Michael, an undergraduate at Oxford, is drowned while swimming with a friend. The two bodies, when recovered, are found clinging together.<br /><br />On April 5, 1960, Peter Llewellyn Davies, by then an esteemed publisher, threw himself under a subway train in London. We should not presume to read a mind in torment, but we may note in passing that, if he had lived another month, he would have reached the centenary of Barrie's birth and thus, one imagines, a fresh flurry of interest in ""Peter Pan""""that terrible masterpiece,"" in the words of Peter Llewellyn Davies.","When watching this movie, with it's deterministic cause and effect, wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment, can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how Barrie's life played out?

"<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them. I think of the Mexican people who (either in an attempt to support Mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top Mexican stars) saw it, half of the people went out of the theater when I went to watch it, it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect. I think too of the people from other countries who dared spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end, ""what a piece of crap"". In order to understand Cronica de un desayuno, one has to be mexican, and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes (or even better, be part of them). There's nothing accidental in this movie, the family is and has what many families, in Mexico at least, share. One has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely, it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it. The older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his RED couch, the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother is going to an excursion, and all he cares about is the yellow radio, the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family, no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father came back after who knows how long, allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be momentary, and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons... The stories around the house are surrealistic (and so is the movie), a travestite looking for his penis, a factory worker and his attempt of suicide, subtled by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding his bicycle after a interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? mother?... The music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot, not more than a snare drum, cymbal, a some strings. Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.<br /><br />One of the [[best]] mexican movies ever!, and one of the less [[understood]], even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.<br /><br />","<br /><br />The kind of movie that demands too much from the audience, yet to disappoint most of them.

"Visitors is a hard, hard movie to enjoy. It's so slow and leaden in it's pacing that at times I was drifting off during the film. This was about 11AM on a hot, sunny day, I might add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is.<br /><br />Strange thing is, it's not long. At 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior Darkwolf that I'd quite happily watched the day before. It just drags an awful lot, enough for you to lose interest.<br /><br />When it's not mistaking S-L-O-O-W development for atmosphere, Visitors is good enough at action to almost make it excusable how slowly things happen. While the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out Radha Mitchell's boats-woman, the hauntings/aliens/whatever are actually quite creepy and effective, especially when her suicidal mother turns up and starts groaning in the night. Full marks for not splurging make-up all over the shop too. The single person boat is a creepy place, and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you.<br /><br />Still though, I find it hard to recommend Visitors. I came out of it not only feeling like I'd just watched a 4 hour film, not a 100 minute one, but also feeling like I'd been cheated somehow, as while offering many explanations as to the hauntings (Mind games? Real ghosts? Space aliens?) Visitors doesn't pick one for definite. All that watching Radha Mitchell talk to her cat and Dominic Purcell smoulder for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past, for nothing?. Say what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he tells you what happened, however crazy/stupid you might think it. If you don't watch a lot of these movies, your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat, but [[I]] found this slow, [[boring]] and highly [[derivative]].

"With [[Nurse]] Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the [[Company]] of [[Men]], Your [[Friends]] & Neighbors) [[makes]] his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as [[opposed]] to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and [[yet]] remains [[true]] to his [[roots]]. While his [[cast]] is now [[composed]] of A-list Hollywood [[names]] (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris [[Rock]]), his material [[remains]] just as [[bizarre]] and quirky as his [[first]] two features, [[proving]] that he just may be the [[next]] big [[thing]]. [[Nurse]] Betty is [[one]] of the [[darkest]] [[comedies]] to be [[advertised]] towards a mainstream audience in years, and [[considering]] its moderate box office and [[critical]] success, [[perhaps]] moviegoers weren't as [[dumb]] and brainwashed as we though they were. The [[story]] [[follows]] (both figuratively AND literally) a naive waitress (Zellweger) who has fallen in love from afar with a handsome soap star (As Good As It Gets's Greg Kinnear) but is trapped in a loveless [[marriage]] to a slimy car dealer (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is gruesomely murdered by two hitmen (Freeman and Rock), she's [[sent]] into [[shock]] and obliviously [[sets]] out for Hollywood to [[meet]] her [[object]] of affection -- unaware that he's only an actor. When Freeman and Rock [[discover]] that the car she took [[contains]] [[10]] kilos of cocaine, they [[hit]] the road as [[well]] and outrageousness [[ensues]]. Fans of LaBute's previous work might have a [[hard]] [[time]] [[figuring]] out how this could [[possibly]] be the same [[guy]] who [[directed]] [[In]] the [[Company]] of [[Men]] -- a tragicomedy about two cruel sexist [[pigs]] who [[play]] a [[practical]] [[joke]] on a deaf [[co-worker]] --, but when you [[think]] about it, the connection is rather [[clear]]: in Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is being ruthlessly [[taken]] advantage of. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the [[man]] she's chasing thinks her genuine [[adoration]] is [[nothing]] more than a joke. Some might begin to wonder if LaBute is really some sort of misogynist himself -- [[considering]] that his recurring theme involves the [[downfall]] of innocent [[women]]. But personally, [[I]] [[think]] he's [[coming]] to the defense of the fair sex and [[dealing]] far more harshly with the abusers in his [[pictures]] than the [[abused]]. One of the many charms of this film is that it's absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when handling a script such as this one, would leave the story at two hitmen chasing a woman chasing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and has one of the hitmen (Freeman) fall obsessively for Betty as well. This was an interesting role for Freeman to take, because it allowed him to play off of his trademark `this-is-the-last-time' character (see Unforgiven, Se7en, and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); the supporting cast also includes the likes of famed weirdo Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney, and `Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The script, written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is deliriously over-the-top (honestly: have you ever seen a comedy -- or ANY movie, for that matter -- in which a man is scalped in his own dining room?). You could argue that the ending is a little too perfect, but it's really not worth denying everything that's great about the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign of what LaBute has in store for us next, you can bet that I'll be lining up for whatever he decides to follow it up with.<br /><br />Grade: A-","With [[suck]] Betty (2000), acclaimed indie film-maker Neil LaBute (In the [[company]] of [[men]], Your [[Quaker]] & Neighbors) [[hold]] his breakthrough into the big-budgeted (Betty's $24 million as [[fight]] to Company's measly $25,000), mainstream realm -- and [[notwithstanding]] remains [[rightful]] to his [[settle]].

"Guy Pearce looks like and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys who wear Levi's Jeans and stand in front of a herd of stampeding Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo like Levi's too. In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, ""Look at me, I am so pretty!"" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much [[acting]] in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The [[original]] version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much [[better]] actors. The original version of this movie [[made]] the PAST seem like the [[real]] [[base]] of the characters. This new version [[lacks]] [[substance]] and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then [[fails]] to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very [[well]] [[explained]], and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher [[shop]] filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also [[silly]] is the giant [[pit]] full of water and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX.

In every scene, Guy Pearce looks like he is saying, ""Look at me, I am so pretty!"" As a hero, his character is a total wimp. In every scene that calls for courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: Yet, at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character out-runs a pack of baboon-like Morlocks who can run and leap along the side of the walls (like Spiderman). Around the same time, the TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of some kind that wipes out an entire valley. Strangely, even though Pearce and his gal-pal Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock that gets killed; seconds later Pearce, Mumba, and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain. Now THAT is FAST RUNNING!!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model-turned-actress is not very cute, and she does not do much [[pretend]] in this movie. The scenes which take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Even though the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine 1900s people would walk and talk. The [[master]] version of this movie was a lot better in this respect. The period characters were much more realistic, and they were much [[salutary]] actors. The original version of this movie [[form]] the PAST seem like the [[veridical]] [[lowly]] of the characters. This new version [[want]] [[nitty-gritty]] and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with the death of Emma and then [[betray]] to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of the Morlocks being cannibals is not very [[easily]] [[explain]], and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher [[shit]] filled with knives and cutlery, yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow-dart. Also [[zany]] is the giant [[fossa]] full of water and bones. All through the underground, the Morlocks are all walking around chewing on meaty bones. So how can all those skeletons be in the pit? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted flesh?? And where are the restrooms for all of these creatures? As I was watching the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet & plumbing system, considering that they were tossing in lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-balling her friend, Mandingo. One other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music which is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is that African Moaning Singer (Is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) that starts wailing and moaning over the LION KING jungle music. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and the jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think that Elton John should probably look into this matter. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once, then forget it.",0.3080463409423828,0.5033747553825378,0,1,0,3967,"Successful"

"""Campfire Tales"" is basically [[made]] up of [[three]] spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic ""Hook"" story, and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a [[little]] abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who [[takes]] refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each [[story]] becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that [[awaits]] them is [[yet]] to [[come]]...<br /><br />In my opinion, the last story they [[tell]] is [[probably]] the [[scariest]] and had some genuine, [[frightening]] effects. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it's unoriginal plot was it's [[downfall]]. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like eight [[years]] old on HBO and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it's not scary to me now.

[[7]]/10.","""Campfire Tales"" is basically [[crap]] up of [[trine]] spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert. The film begins with the classic ""Hook"" story, and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert. They crash their car, put out some flares, and start a fire in a [[piddling]] abandoned chapel, waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire. To pass the time, they decide to start telling classic horror stories, about terrorized honeymooners, a girl who falls prey to an Internet predator, and a motorist who [[drive]] refuge in a haunted house. As they tell the eerie tales, each [[storey]] becomes increasingly terrifying, but the real shock that [[look]] them is [[notwithstanding]] to [[ejaculate]]...<br /><br />In my opinion, the last story they [[distinguish]] is [[likely]] the [[scary]] and had some genuine, [[dire]] effects. The first story was alright, and the motorhome sequence near the end was a little creepy. The second story built a lot of suspense, more than either of the others did, but it's unoriginal plot was it's [[precipitation]]. I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was like eight [[yr]] old on HBO and the third story scared the crap out of me, although it's not scary to me now.

"This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovský is [[remarkable]] for its particularity but [[annoying]] and [[distracting]] in its [[details]]. Taking its theme and title from a Robert Graves poem, it deals with a woman with several men and some obnoxious relatives in her life who's [[trying]] to survive and protect her two children, 15-year-old Lucina (Michaela Mrvikova) and [[little]] blond asthmatic Kuba (Adam Misik).The poem is much in evidence, but the theme--it gets a [[little]] lost.<br /><br />Marcela (Anna Geislerová), the Beauty, and Jarda (Roman Luknár) have lost everything in the Prague floods of 2002 and have nothing left, it seems, but good sex, which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that Lucina and Kuba, in front of the telly, must hold their ears against the noise. Hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock. There's no [[good]] explanation precisely why, but financial desperation has led Jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet. His car-thief cohort drives off a posh Volvo the easygoing Benes (Josef Abrham) has left with the [[keys]] in the ignition while [[visiting]] a large property he owns. Benes is a super-nice guy, but no fool. His Volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that [[leads]] the cops straight to Jarda's garage and he and his cohort are off to [[jail]].<br /><br />""Beauty in trouble flees to the good angel,/On whom she can rely,"" begins the Graves poem. [[But]] actually this fracas leads Benes to Marcela, when he meets her at the police station. He introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about Tuscany, where he, though Prague-born, owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life. He's here to reclaim the house in Prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother, whom he allows to remain. Benes' every gesture is [[benevolent]], even though he doesn't prevent Jarda from going off to jail.<br /><br />In the circumstances Marcela must retreat with Lucina and Kuba to depend on the charity of her mother, Zdena (Jana Brejchova) and the far less tender mercies of Zdena's present husband, the scrawny diabetic Richard Hrstka (Jiri Schmitzer)--who, for the kids, starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies, proves to be the uncle from hell. Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in. This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.","This film by the well-known Czech director and writer collaborator Petr Jarchovský is [[noteworthy]] for its particularity but [[irritating]] and [[unhinge]] in its [[particular]].

Jiri Schmitzer hijacks the film at this point, and never quite lets it go. Even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace. It is surprising that the obnoxious Richard doesn't sexually abuse one or both of the children. He is insistent that Marcela needs to get out on her own, and when Benes offers to take her under his wing he and Richard become improbable allies. Improbable--perhaps implausible. Why should Benes like him? But then, what is Benes's whole story? About some things the film gives too much information and about others, not enough. <br /><br />Clearly the ""good angel,"" Benes is infallibly kind--and a polished, good-looking older man whose manners befit his Italian upbringing. It's only at the end, when he's pushed to the limits over his Prague property by the devious occupants, he proves that he is not one to won't lie down and be walked over. <br /><br />Also to be dealt with is Jarda's religious fanatic mother Sdena (Jana Brejchova), and her interactions with Zdena and Richard are something to watch. But she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck. <br /><br />The poem has been set to music in a Czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist-vocalist Raduza, first in a tiny scene, then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by Jarda and the car thief pal. If you revere Hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence; otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous. Also included are a number of songs by Glen Hansard/Marketa Irglova of the Oscar-award-winning Irish musical film 'Once,' including the latter's theme song, ""Falling."" They feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from 'Once'--though this film came first.<br /><br />Hrebejk's people are arresting; even little Koba has his Shakespearean-child moments and a wealth of charm; but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over-expand. The property hassle Benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side. But such an elaborate demonstration wasn't necessary. The acting is fine, and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity, but the basic themes of love, sex, and money get lost in the shuffle and Marcela's conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear. It's fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to Graves's poem that Marcela still has hot sex with Jarda during a revisit to Prague after moving to Tuscany with Benes and her kids. But there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious Richard or of Jarda's annoyingly pious mother (Emília Vásáryová). How come all of a sudden we learn Koba is getting letters from ""India"" purported to be from his dad, who's in prison? When did that come about? Interesting details, hastily pasted in. This seems a world in which you can't see the forest for the trees.",0.09660917520523071,0.5579215288162231,1,0,1,4673,"Successful"

"Just caught ""The Rain People"" on Turner Classic Movies late one night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player ""Jimmy"" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking.

Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who -- exact reasons unknown -- leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also newly pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a brain-damaged ex-football player ""Jimmy"" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking.

"There were [[heist]] movies before this one, and indeed the [[likes]] of Rififi were an obvious [[influence]] on it - but The [[Red]] [[Circle]] is more than just another [[entry]] in an overpopulated genre and with this [[film]], [[director]] Jean-Pierre Melville has [[managed]] to [[create]] something that both [[thrills]] on the surface and [[gives]] its audience something to [[think]] about. Being cool is just as [[important]] a [[feature]] of the [[modern]] crime [[movie]] as [[guns]] and gangsters, and Melville [[delivers]] that with this [[film]] in droves; the [[tone]] of the [[film]] is very [[relaxed]] too and Melville [[allows]] the [[bulk]] of the [[film]] to bubble under the [[cool]] [[exterior]]. The [[story]] has a [[number]] of angles but the [[central]] [[character]] is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His [[release]] coincides with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel, who [[slips]] from under the [[nose]] of [[Police]] Commissioner Mattei during a [[train]] [[ride]]. The [[first]] thing Corey does upon [[release]] is [[steal]] some money from his [[former]] [[boss]] Rico, and the [[second]] thing he does is [[recruit]] Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him [[pull]] of a [[jewel]] heist. [[But]] Rico and the [[police]] are [[hot]] on the thieves' [[tails]]...<br /><br />The [[film]] is bolted together by [[four]] [[excellent]] [[central]] [[performances]]. Alain Delon is [[calm]] and [[calculating]] as the film's anti-hero, while Gian [[Maria]] Volontè looks formidable in his [[role]] as the escaped murderer. François Périer is [[good]] [[also]] as a [[dubious]] [[club]] owner, while the real standout performance comes from André Bourvil in his [[role]] as the police commissioner. The film runs at [[almost]] [[two]] and a half [[hours]] and is not [[exactly]] a [[thrill]] ride. [[However]], the director keeps [[things]] interesting by keeping the action focused on the important [[elements]]. The [[film]] does [[feature]] crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are [[kept]] to a [[minimum]]. The [[first]] [[two]] [[thirds]] of the movie are really just [[building]] up to the suspenseful [[heist]] [[scene]] towards the [[end]]. Rififi was most famous for its heist [[sequence]] - an intricately designed [[scene]] in which nobody speaks a [[word]]. The [[heist]] in this [[film]] is similar in that it is [[also]] wordless, and [[I]] have to [[say]] that [[I]] [[preferred]] the [[scene]] in Rififi; but Melville's [[skill]] in [[direction]] and the calm and composed [[way]] that it [[plays]] out make [[good]] of it. The [[film]] [[boils]] down to an [[exciting]] climax that [[rounds]] it all off nicely. Overall, this [[might]] not [[appeal]] to all crime film [[fans]] as the action is more than a little bit [[slow]]; but The Red Circle is an excellent film and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.","There were [[burglarise]] movies before this one, and indeed the [[wish]] of Rififi were an obvious [[mold]] on it - but The [[cherry]] [[set]] is more than just another [[submission]] in an overpopulated genre and with this [[flick]], [[manager]] Jean-Pierre Melville has [[deal]] to [[produce]] something that both [[vibrate]] on the surface and [[pay]] its audience something to [[guess]] about. Being cool is just as [[authoritative]] a [[characteristic]] of the [[New]] crime [[flick]] as [[gun]] and gangsters, and Melville [[surrender]] that with this [[pic]] in droves; the [[flavor]] of the [[cinema]] is very [[slack]] too and Melville [[admit]] the [[majority]] of the [[picture]] to bubble under the [[chill]] [[outside]]. The [[narrative]] has a [[routine]] of angles but the [[cardinal]] [[type]] is Corey - a thief who is released from prison. His [[exit]] coincides with the escape of infamous murderer Vogel, who [[cutting]] from under the [[poke]] of [[patrol]] Commissioner Mattei during a [[rail]] [[rally]]. The [[commencement]] thing Corey does upon [[freeing]] is [[bargain]] some money from his [[early]] [[brag]] Rico, and the [[arcsecond]] thing he does is [[inscribe]] Vogel and a sharpshooter to help him [[extract]] of a [[gem]] heist. [[simply]] Rico and the [[constabulary]] are [[spicy]] on the thieves' [[chase]]...<br /><br />The [[flick]] is bolted together by [[quatern]] [[splendid]] [[fundamental]] [[functioning]]. Alain Delon is [[steady]] and [[cipher]] as the film's anti-hero, while Gian [[maria]] Volontè looks formidable in his [[part]] as the escaped murderer. François Périer is [[respectable]] [[too]] as a [[doubtful]] [[nine]] owner, while the real standout performance comes from André Bourvil in his [[character]] as the police commissioner. The film runs at [[about]] [[II]] and a half [[hour]] and is not [[just]] a [[rush]] ride. [[still]], the director keeps [[affair]] interesting by keeping the action focused on the important [[ingredient]]. The [[cinema]] does [[sport]] crime film stapes such as shootings, but they are [[unbroken]] to a [[minimal]]. The [[foremost]] [[2]] [[third]] of the movie are really just [[build]] up to the suspenseful [[holdup]] [[aspect]] towards the [[remainder]]. Rififi was most famous for its heist [[episode]] - an intricately designed [[scenery]] in which nobody speaks a [[password]]. The [[holdup]] in this [[cinema]] is similar in that it is [[too]] wordless, and [[single]] have to [[state]] that [[unity]] [[favor]] the [[scenery]] in Rififi; but Melville's [[science]] in [[management]] and the calm and composed [[path]] that it [[bet]] out make [[dear]] of it. The [[cinema]] [[moil]] down to an [[stimulate]] climax that [[stave]] it all off nicely.

"""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"". Cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. Cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a sort of ""Folk Hero"" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.<br /><br />My primary problem with ""ODC"" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey does a [[good]] job portraying Michael Lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /><br />The film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. Writer Gerard Stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an Irish ""Lock Stock"" or a grittier treatment of Martin Cahill's thieving career? That's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /><br />It's also unfortunate that ""ODC"" followed the cinema release of John Boorman's ""The General"", which was a more accurate portrayal of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.<br /><br />What IS surprising is that a studio was prepared to take Cahill's story and give it a happy Hollywood-style ending. Kevin Spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief Michael Lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in ""ODC"". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. <br /><br />The real Cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his ""Man of The People"" self-image. Having Michael Lynch give up everything to avoid death in ""ODC"" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.","""Ordinary Decent Criminal"" is sort of based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film ""The General"".

The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British [[territory]], the American colonies.

The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times!

For great examples of this, seek out Tashlin's 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'. 'Censored' is fairly weak by comparison.",0.33894455432891846,0.9039742946624756,0,1,0,1234,"Successful"

That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't.

However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of the one I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer's chilling performance in Friday THE 13TH. As such, I believe that even on a [[bad]] day, she'd pull off a [[better]] performance than anyone [[involved]] in the [[travesty]] known as THE [[HAUNT]].<br /><br />With regard to my heading, this movie is not [[painful]] to [[watch]] because the [[content]] is disturbing. It is [[painful]] to [[watch]] because it is just downright [[boring]].<br /><br />Reading the positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities.

A series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.<br /><br />On the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.<br /><br />Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. And then some!<br /><br />First, the acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. This factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ""ghost"" does!<br /><br />Second, the direction. The direction is haphazard and very uneven. Some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost.<br /><br />Third, the script. Whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. This movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. Whilst this style was also the case with British movies from the British horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. Peter Cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors in THE HAUNT.<br /><br />Finally, the humour. The ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. An obese boy is the butt of many jokes. One particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. This scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!<br /><br />The only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen.<br /><br />Overall, THE HAUNT is an appalling movie. It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.","BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a movie starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events.

It is not even in the ""so bad it's good"" league. It is instead just boring. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even bother seeing it for free!<br /><br />I have never seen the other movie about the Bell Witch. But it really couldn't be any worse than THE HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other movie a chance if I can track it down.<br /><br />In the meantime, I would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.",0.27625179290771484,0.5001583099365234,0,1,0,5842,"Successful"

"""It all [[depends]] on how you [[look]] at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to [[hell]],"" says the priest Rev. Harlan in ""Northfork."" The Polish brothers' [[film]] is an ambitious [[one]] that will [[make]] any [[intelligent]] [[viewer]] to [[sit]] up, provided he or she has patience and basic [[knowledge]] of Christianity. The layers of [[entertainment]] the [[film]] [[provide]] [[takes]] a [[viewer]] beyond the surreal and [[absurd]] imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back American to reflect on current [[social]] values. The film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the [[depths]] of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who [[nearly]] ""[[crucify]]"" their [[feet]] to wooden [[floor]] of their [[homes]], angels who [[need]] multiple [[glasses]] to read, etc.) and absurd [[images]] (of half animals, half [[toys]] that are [[alive]], of door bells that [[make]] most [[delicate]] of musical outputs of a [[harp]], a blind angel who keeps [[writing]] [[unreadable]] [[tracts]], etc.) could [[make]] a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the [[arts]] to [[wonder]] what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. Though European cinema has better credentials in this [[field]], Hollywood has indeed [[made]] such films in the [[past]] in ""[[Cat]] Ballou"", Lee Marvin and his horse [[leaned]] against the wall to [[take]] a nap, several decades ago. ""Northfork,"" in one [[scene]] of the citizens leaving the [[town]] in cars, seemed to pay homage to the [[row]] of cars in ""Citizen Kane"" [[taking]] Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic.<br /><br />The [[film]] is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue ([[one]] of the finest I can recall) can be heard as a [[voice]] over towards the [[end]] of the credits. The directors [[seem]] to leave the finest [[moments]] to those who can [[stay]] with [[film]] to the [[end]]. If you have the patience you will [[savor]] the layers of the [[film]]if you gulp or [[swallow]] what the [[Polish]] bothers dish out, you will [[miss]] out on its many flavors.<[[br]] /><br />What is the [[film]] all about? At the most obvious layer, a town is being [[vacated]] to [[make]] way for a [[dam]] and hydroelectric-project. [[Even]] [[cemeteries]] are being [[dug]] up so that the mortal [[remains]] of the [[dead]] can be [[moved]] to [[higher]] [[burial]] [[grounds]]. [[Real]] estate [[promoters]] are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have Christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. Most are devout Christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a [[mother]], finds one in an androgynous angel called ""Flower Hercules."" While the filmmaker does [[give]] clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.<br /><br />At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.<br /><br />The final layer is the social commentary""The country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people."" Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.<br /><br />To the religious, the film says ""Pray and you shall receive"" (words of Fr Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). To the consumerist, the film says ""its what we do with our wings that separate us"" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different [[often]] far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).<br /><br />The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a [[loaded]] script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.","""It all [[count]] on how you [[feeling]] at it we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to [[blaze]],"" says the priest Rev. Harlan in ""Northfork."" The Polish brothers' [[take]] is an ambitious [[unity]] that will [[shuffle]] any [[reasoning]] [[spectator]] to [[posture]] up, provided he or she has patience and basic [[cognition]] of Christianity. The layers of [[amusement]] the [[flick]] [[render]] [[remove]] a [[spectator]] beyond the surreal and [[ridiculous]] imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio-political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid-back American to reflect on current [[societal]] values. The film's adoption of the surreal (coffins that emerge from the [[depth]] of man-made lakes to float and disturb the living, homesteaders who [[closely]] ""[[bedevil]]"" their [[foundation]] to wooden [[level]] of their [[household]], angels who [[pauperism]] multiple [[glass]] to read, etc.) and absurd [[see]] (of half animals, half [[miniature]] that are [[awake]], of door bells that [[get]] most [[fragile]] of musical outputs of a [[harmonica]], a blind angel who keeps [[compose]] [[unclear]] [[pathway]], etc.) could [[stimulate]] a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the [[humanities]] to [[admiration]] what the movie is un-spooling as entertainment. Though European cinema has better credentials in this [[domain]], Hollywood has indeed [[hit]] such films in the [[preceding]] in ""[[guy]] Ballou"", Lee Marvin and his horse [[list]] against the wall to [[shoot]] a nap, several decades ago. ""Northfork,"" in one [[aspect]] of the citizens leaving the [[townspeople]] in cars, seemed to pay homage to the [[rowing]] of cars in ""Citizen Kane"" [[have]] Kane and his wife out of Xanadu for a picnic.<br /><br />The [[pic]] is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film-goerthe most interesting epilogue ([[ace]] of the finest I can recall) can be heard as a [[vox]] over towards the [[remainder]] of the credits. The directors [[appear]] to leave the finest [[moment]] to those who can [[persist]] with [[movie]] to the [[remainder]]. If you have the patience you will [[nip]] the layers of the [[take]]if you gulp or [[accept]] what the [[finish]] bothers dish out, you will [[escape]] out on its many flavors.<[[BR]] /><br />What is the [[shoot]] all about? At the most obvious layer, a town is being [[repeal]] to [[clear]] way for a [[dike]] and hydroelectric-project. [[eventide]] [[graveyard]] are being [[dig]] up so that the mortal [[clay]] of the [[stagnant]] can be [[actuate]] to [[mellow]] [[sepulture]] [[evidence]]. [[veridical]] estate [[showman]] are hawking the lakeside properties to 6 people who can evict the townsfolk. Of the 6, only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup, while others cannot get anything served to them.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have Christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk. Most are devout Christians, but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true Christian principles, exemplified in the priest. Many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions.<br /><br />At the next layer, you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other. You realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on Hercules and dreams of a [[beget]], finds one in an androgynous angel called ""Flower Hercules."" While the filmmaker does [[yield]] clues that Flower is an extension of the young angel's delirious imagination, subsequent actions of Flower belie this option. You are indeed in the world of angels--not gods but the pure in spiritand therefore not in the world of the living. The softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots.<br /><br />At another layer the toy plane of Irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven 1000 miles away from Norfolk.<br /><br />The final layer is the social commentary""The country is divided into two types of people. Fords people and Chevy people."" Is there a difference? They think they are different but both are consumerist.<br /><br />To the religious, the film says ""Pray and you shall receive"" (words of Fr Harlan, quoted by Angel Flower Hercules). To the consumerist, the film says ""its what we do with our wings that separate us"" (each of the 6 evictors also have wings-one duck/goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different [[frequently]] far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car).<br /><br />The film is certainly not the finest American film but it is definitely a notable path-breaking work--superb visuals, striking performances (especially Nick Nolte), and a [[adulterate]] script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences.",0.09838265180587769,0.11159348487854004,1,1,1,6853,"Failed"

"I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then-seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight off the huge success of ""American Graffiti"" and produced basically at the same time as ""Star Wars"", this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself. The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it's edited than the actual material. The writer/director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines, the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself.<br /><br />Lucas' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical ""last big night"" before school ends and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to go off to college. One thing that made that film work, despite the fact that it's very episodic, is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There's a disposition of time, like in Nick Ray's ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life, but everything takes place in a static space. ""More American Graffiti"" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) off in Vietnam, his former girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drag racing on the semi-pro circuit. In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race, but after that the threads don't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original. Instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years' of time, just seeing various events on New Years Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to become confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events, this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film.<br /><br />The best parts of the movie to me are the ones with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other. A good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better, and if the other parts weren't such a drag. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame, unfunny, and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo didn't help at all. It was just another contrived moment, like when they briefly explain why Curt isn't in the movie because he's already in Canada. Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There's a black kind of satire to some of the Vietnam stuff, very similar to what I would imagine Lucas and John Milius' original idea for ""Apocalypse Now"" would have been like. And there's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still along with that fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie dragging it down, as if anyone wants to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment. I think even if those parts of the movie weren't so painful, it still wouldn't really be comparable to the first movie because there's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything. It just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freeze frame imitation of ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and so many better films.<br /><br />Like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable. The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are great, and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see -- I wonder if even back then he had to use a wig? I couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has some small affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I guess I have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it's really as worthless as I remember it being. It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of ""American Graffiti"" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as ""American Graffiti"" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated. Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.","I really don't think producer George Lucas didn't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as ""More American Graffiti"" turned out to be.

Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /><br />At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, Beth simply adds that ""she understands (Cherry's) need to be heard"" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.<br /><br />Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (Maybe I'm a little left out of the scene, but last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their ""I'm so indie and mod"" attitudes), Beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun.

"Caddyshack 2 has a dreadful reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a highly-held classic. People have criticised the film on a lot of grounds, but they all ultimately hark back to the fact that this is not Caddyshack.<br /><br />I would begin by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and consider this film on its own merits, but I think that would be unfair. The movie does have a lot in common with its predecessor. The class-related themes of 'snobs versus slobs' and the desire to fit in to a class above your own are as prevalent here as they were in the first movie. The two things that are truly lacking here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who are replaced with Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively.<br /><br />Now I am not about to try and argue that Ackroyd comes close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. He comes off as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without biting too heavily on either. I wouldn't say that he is anywhere close to being as [[funny]] as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there is a whole lot more point to his character and his dilemma in the film.<br /><br />Chevy Chase only pops up and handful of times in the movie, which is another common complaint. Maybe these particular naysayers didn't notice that he only popped up a few times in the first movie. For my money, his scenes here are a lot funnier, if somewhat over-directed.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, it is really the over-direction of this movie that brings it down. It comes across as far more self-conscious in its attempts to get a laugh. Many of the jokes are laboured and there's far too much of the Gopher, who seems to have taken on a far more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, just in case we didn't grasp the idea that its meant to be funny.<br /><br />Characters are similarly hammered [[home]], particularly the smarmy yuppy kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and is consistently likable and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with a quirky music cue.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a fun, goofy movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies at the time were saying.

All these elements are [[richly]] at [[work]] in 'Mulholland [[Drive]],' [[making]] for a riveting, [[hair-raising]], and [[highly]] [[satisfying]] [[film]] experience  especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to [[make]] all the plot pieces [[fit]] into a [[logical]], mystery-unraveling whole.<br /><[[br]] />The [[film]] [[features]] [[wonderful]] [[performances]] by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the [[lead]] roles of [[young]] women whose lives intersect in [[various]] ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary [[reality]], retro '50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their [[seemingly]] random initial [[meeting]] occurs after the film's opening scene, in which Harring's [[character]] [[escapes]] an [[attempt]] on her [[life]] thanks to a fortuitous, not to [[mention]] horrific, [[automobile]] [[accident]]. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland [[Drive]] to Sunset [[Boulevard]] (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she [[finds]] her [[way]] to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi [[Watts]]) is about to sublet from her '[[Aunt]] Ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a [[new]] movie. [[As]] we later [[learn]], Betty had herself [[arrived]] from [[Deep]] River, Ontario, [[shortly]] after [[winning]] a jitterbug contest.<br /><[[br]] />[[A]] highly energetic and stylized flashback to the [[contest]] forms one of two pre-credit prologue [[sequences]] that [[frame]] Betty's [[descent]] from the clichéd would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the [[debauched]] madness of [[spurned]] lover and [[going]] nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to [[remember]] her own [[name]], the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns [[Aunt]] Ruth's apartment. ([[Actually]], it turns out [[Aunt]] [[Ruth]] has long since [[deceased]] and whose [[apartment]] we're really in is a [[good]] question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the [[matching]] of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.","Spoiler Alert - although this is a [[game]] [[most]] as [[inconceivable]] to [[blow]] as it is to [[all]] explain.<br /><br />'Mulholland Drive' is by [[FAR]] the most successful expression of David Lynch's cinematographic [[flair]] and [[imagination]] since the [[beginning]] season of his 'Twin Peaks' [[tv]] series.

Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland [[movement]] to Sunset [[avenue]] (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she [[rule]] her [[room]] to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi [[W]]) is about to sublet from her '[[aunt]] Ruth,' a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a [[young]] movie. [[AS]] we later [[con]], Betty had herself [[get]] from [[late]] River, Ontario, [[briefly]] after [[acquire]] a jitterbug contest.<br /><[[BR]] />[[amp]] highly energetic and stylized flashback to the [[competition]] forms one of two pre-credit prologue [[succession]] that [[entrap]] Betty's [[ancestry]] from the clichéd would-be-starlet's bright-eyed innocence to the [[libertine]] madness of [[pooh-pooh]] lover and [[exit]] nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to [[recollect]] her own [[identify]], the Harring character adopts the name 'Rita' from a movie poster for the film noir classic 'Gilda' that adorns [[aunt]] Ruth's apartment. ([[really]], it turns out [[aunt]] [[pity]] has long since [[die]] and whose [[flat]] we're really in is a [[well]] question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita's purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated 'mainstream').<br /><br />At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita's attention is caught by a waitress's name-tag reading 'Diane.' This leads her to a recollection of someone named 'Diane Selwyn,' whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty's insistence, break into. I won't reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called 'Silencio,' where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination  rather like Steven's ""man with the blue guitar"" as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.<br /><br />During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying'), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the [[agree]] of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.<br /><br />After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in 'Vertigo.' While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from 'Twin Peaks,' including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.<br /><br />However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of 'Mulholland Drive' is much greater  and more mysterious  than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What's more, the film's cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.",0.09870505332946777,0.10886549949645996,1,1,1,9797,"Failed"

"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a drag queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are [[lousy]] dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the final film is a letdown.","Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it.

"If you're in the middle of a [[ferocious]] [[war]] and it's [[still]] not [[clear]] that you're [[going]] to come out on [[top]], among the [[things]] you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to [[demonstrate]] that our [[troops]] have the bravery, the resourcefulness and the [[dedication]] to overcome all the odds in a noble [[cause]]. And that's just what [[director]] Anthony Asquith [[provided]] the British with 1943's naval war [[film]], We Dive at [[Dawn]]. After more than 60 years, it's not surprising that some of the [[movie]] is dated. It doesn't help that the [[class]] [[stereotypes]] which [[help]] [[define]] the [[enlisted]] [[men]] from the officers can be jarring.

In this [[movie]], Freddie Taylor ([[John]] Mills), the [[captain]] of the [[submarine]] Sea [[Tiger]], is clever, confident, resourceful, aggressive, in [[control]], [[good]] with his [[men]], humorous with his peers, [[quick]] to [[make]] a decision. And it [[helps]] that he's lucky. His men are jolly tars, for the most part, competent at their jobs and [[always]] ready with a [[joke]] when things [[get]] tense.

[[He]] thinks it might [[still]] be for the [[Germans]]. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie, so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some, like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel, still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others, like We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still, Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic, inside the sub as well as out, as you could hope for, and the battle for the [[fuel]] depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film, but it's a well-made, well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills, it's worth noting, had a long, long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit, cheerfulness and perseverance, but of also being trustworthy, a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman, a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode, but Portman manages some complexity for his character.

Benny deemed the notion of a [[counterpart]] to Monte Carlo [[idiotic]], and he'd have [[preferred]] to continue his life as a playboy in L.A. Not until much [[later]] Benny warmed to the idea. But of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his.<br /><br />In the movie, Benny wants to [[use]] [[Count]] diFrasso to [[get]] [[close]] to Mussolini in [[order]] to assassinate him because he was Hitler's partner, and Hitler [[killed]] jews in gas [[chambers]], after all. Obviously we're [[supposed]] to like Benny, so the screenwriters invented this nonsense. In real [[life]], at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, least of all Benny who was completely uninterested in politics. In fact he did use the countess' connection and he did [[visit]] Mussolini, but not to [[kill]] him, but to sell explosives to him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his sojourn in Italy.<br /><br />The [[whole]] Greenberg subplot was [[nonsense]].

Benny deemed the notion of a [[twin]] to Monte Carlo [[laughable]], and he'd have [[opt]] to continue his life as a playboy in L.A. Not until much [[late]] Benny warmed to the idea. But of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his.<br /><br />In the movie, Benny wants to [[habit]] [[reckon]] diFrasso to [[stick]] [[near]] to Mussolini in [[consecrate]] to assassinate him because he was Hitler's partner, and Hitler [[kill]] jews in gas [[chamber]], after all. Obviously we're [[presuppose]] to like Benny, so the screenwriters invented this nonsense. In real [[spirit]], at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, least of all Benny who was completely uninterested in politics. In fact he did use the countess' connection and he did [[call]] Mussolini, but not to [[killing]] him, but to sell explosives to him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his sojourn in Italy.<br /><br />The [[solid]] Greenberg subplot was [[gimcrack]]. Greenberg didn't [[go]] stool pigeon, he didn't [[search]] [[resort]] with Benny, Benny didn't kill him (that was up to Albert Tannenbaum)... at least they got the [[call]] right.<br /><br />[[unity]] guess it was supposed to be very romantic to have Virginia return to [[benni]], [[propose]] him the money she had [[steal]].

"[[I]] am not surprised to [[find]] user comments for this film [[full]] of gushy [[nonsense]], such as that this film ""[[[proves]]] that when it is predestined, [[love]] will [[find]] a way."" [[I]] begin in this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this [[citation]] so [[typifies]] the hyperbolic, uncritical treacle that was [[poured]] out over this film, even before it [[hit]] the theaters. [[Even]] the [[best]] of films do not ""prove"" anything, nor are they [[intended]] to. The [[best]] films entertain and [[move]] the viewer, and ""The English Patient"" [[fails]] on both [[criteria]].<br /><[[br]] />I remember the studio's promotion of ""The English Patient"" very clearly: ""From the producers of 'Amadeus' and '[[One]] Flew Over the Cuckoo's [[Nest]],'"" it grandly announced. An ignorant or careless listener might miss the crucial [[word]], ""producers,"" in this disingenuous statement and mistakenly associate the director of ""The English Patient,"" so very inappropriately, with the truly great director, Milos Forman. Such a comparison is offensive to the memory of Mr. Forman.<br /><br />While the novel by Michael Ondaatje upon which the film was based, is a [[good]] one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way whatsoever.

It is almost as if Minghella had, as a reader, entirely missed what was valuable in the novel and could grind out on celluloid only a pale, skeletal version, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story, but that focused on the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for story's metaphors but no apparent cognizance of them, as well.<br /><br />Minghella took the central focus away from Hana and Kip and put it on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thereby missing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the ""essence"" of it.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas put in unengaging, uninspiring, uninvolving, unemotional performances that were obviously intended to convey a great, driving, passionate love-affair to the viewer, but which in fact delivered only an inexplicable, perfunctory liaison between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and unexciting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and overblown presentation.<br /><br />The ""grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like"" qualities to which the many undiscriminating reviewers of this goofy film love to refer simply is not there. The comparison to David Lean (""Dr. Zhivago"") is positively insulting to yet another great director.

"Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids. A bit predictable. The book was better, gave more plot details, ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy.

"I gave ""Airport '79"" only two stars because it's a [[truly]] [[lousy]] film. Nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) This is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />A'79 really does seem like an early version of ""Airplane!"" Every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. You're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? The hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? No problem. You can still catch that early-morning flight to Paris...no need to get the cops involved. Your plane dodges one unmanned ""drone"" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified Phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's truly funny.<br /><br />And I'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (God spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. Jimmie basically says, ""Nope."" Later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. This aspect of the film is just fun. (ONE passenger actually obeys the attendant. When Charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />In [[summary]], a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit [[amusing]].

"One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no [[style]] whatsoever. True, the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors - and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is [[wrong]], [[starting]] with the script, which is another one of those TV-movie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a ""famous quote"" by the subject and every other scene is an in-your-face introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer; Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer, becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists, and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the [[dying]] octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a fine performance) as a shy, insecure [[painter]] of gay-themed canvases who is befriended by [[Crisp]]; and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's persona, offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is [[given]] no chance by the script to embody the down-to-earth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because ""after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse,"" or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never [[get]] the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the ""streets of New York"" scenes have a sterile, unreal look with no [[sense]] of the period. <br /><br />The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line, every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very, very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So, for him and him alone this film is worth a look.","One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30-plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision, but no.

The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil-tanker and an old steel-factory, which they decorated with awful lights and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. The prop-master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns which look like today's .45 magnums and ""Prof"" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around in order to move.<br /><br />Aside from one dried-up corpse, a few impalements and one dismemberment there's absolutely no gore. And the vampire-fangs and contact-lenses look fake as hell. Add to that also the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending ever: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having one final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they lock themselves in the control-room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was upgraded and joining narcotics, she used to be a ""Protheus 3.2 PB"", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says ""Well then, what are you waiting for"". Humvee answers ""Ain't gotta tell me twice. Come on, girl"", picks her up and... ""BOOOOOOM!!!"" the ship explodes and credits roll. No sex-scene, no Erika flashin' her boobies, no bloody climax,... Just one more shot of Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over.<br /><br />So, this movie is a must-see for every bad-movie-lover, but I must warn them: It gets really painful at times.

"It is hard to judge 'Imaginary Heroes' without referring to the fact that director and script writer Dan Harris is only 25.

"[[I]] watched SEA OF [[DUST]] at the Rhode Island Horror [[Film]] Festival in Providence.

It [[even]] has an original classical style musical score.<br /><br />[[I]] am a Savini [[fan]] and he's the [[star]] villain here, in [[black]] cape, he's more of an evil force than a [[real]] [[person]] I [[think]]. He is sucking the souls out of people and [[using]] them as soldiers in a [[twisted]] attempt to establish his [[version]] of the [[Kingdom]] of [[God]] on Earth. In his [[view]], [[Christ]] was all about suffering and Savini intends to [[make]] everyone suffer.<br /><br />The [[main]] story [[line]] that holds your interest is about a young [[doctor]], Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events Savini is causing in an isolated town. He proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her SOB [[father]] [[tells]] him to [[get]] [[lost]]. [[Then]] he [[meets]] up with a strangely possessed but alluring [[country]] girl. I [[think]] she [[falls]] in [[love]] with him, but she also tries to kill him, as do a number of hot women in the film.<br /><br />I found the [[scenes]] [[shot]] in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye [[catching]], with [[strange]] people along the [[road]] (the evil [[little]] [[twin]] girls [[scared]] the hell out of me).<br /><br />The [[film]] has a lot to it, too much to [[list]]. There is a [[lot]] of blood, [[torture]] and [[gore]]. Hot chicks [[licking]] [[blood]] off of guys' [[fingers]]. [[A]] terrified girl's [[head]] explodes. That was unexpected. Throats [[get]] [[slit]]. [[Some]] brutal stabbings.<br /><br />[[Then]] they play it for laughs sometimes, [[poking]] a bit of fun at the [[whole]] evil [[black]] forest genre.<br /><br />If you're a fan of [[Hammer]] films and Ingrid Pitt, it is fascinating to [[see]] her in this [[movie]]. She offs one of the leads by plunging a [[cross]] in his skull. [[Excellent]]. The guy who played ""Multiple Miggs"" in Silence of the Lambs is great in an axe fight.<br /><br />The movie is surreal and with the ending, I'm not sure the events happened or if they were in Stefan's head because of his rejection by his would-be fiancée. He returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal.<br /><br />The director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. I can see that for sure, Savini's view of religion was scary.<br /><br />This was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like Savini and Pitt, a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes, great gore scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next.<br /><br />This deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort, I don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to make something really attractive, unique and thought provoking.","[[single]] watched SEA OF [[disperse]] at the Rhode Island Horror [[take]] Festival in Providence.

"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a [[senseless]] mess. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber.

""It's got something...[[I]] don't know quite what,"" says Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff, ""but send a few bottles up to my room."") <br /><br />Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns in a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. ""Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!"" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is ""a gay arcadia of happy girls."" Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors.

Salvation [[May]] be at hand, [[notwithstanding]], when a [[fat]] sheik [[direct]] his daughter to [[link]] the [[4th]] [[organise]] and [[invite]] a proper English [[instruction]]. The [[fop]] also is a horse owner and one of his prize racers, Arab Boy, is being trained [[good]] the [[train]] for a [[raceway]]. It's only a matter of time before the fourth- [[organise]] [[girlfriend]] [[strain]] a racing pool and [[play]] heavily on Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton [[lend]] to the pool what funds the school has left. (Much of the fourth-form girl's money comes from the gin they make in chemistry, then bottle and [[depleted]] by [[leash]] to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney fixer, for distribution. ""It's got something...[[single]] don't know quite what,"" says Miss Fritton on sampling the stuff, ""but send a few bottles up to my room."") <br /><br />Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, also is Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has placed a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he has placed the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form has kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form has taken the horse back, Flash Harry has joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and his Homburg-wearing gang have arrived, parents are driving up for Parent's Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very proper inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It's hard to say which is more dangerous, the African spears or the flour bombs. <br /><br />Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton turns in a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a stately bosom, fond of long gowns with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She takes everything in stride, even a fourth-former pounding at something in chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. ""Oh dear. I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!"" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is ""a gay arcadia of happy girls."" Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Other than the sheer chaos of all the little (and not so little) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the film's pleasure.",0.10252338647842407,0.516287088394165,1,0,1,4176,"Successful"

"Director Lesley Selander's thoroughly [[routine]] outdoor yarn ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" (1954) pits the Cheyenne against the U.S. Cavalry with leathery tough Rory Calhoun in the middle as the seasoned, buckskin-clad Indian scout who has to lead the survivors to safety. This United Artists western was lensed in color but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicably in black & white.<br /><br />The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of ""Black Spurs"") eluding several Indians and riding up to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne chief, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly""), who has killing on his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne braves are poised to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. On his way to inform stuck-up camp commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of ""Objective, Burma!""),about the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph seductively treading water in a lake. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of ""I, Jury"") is another of those silly women in westerns that bathe nude in the middle of Indian country without a care in the world. Castle appears to be genuinely nude in her bathing scenes, too, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Naturally, Major Ives dismisses Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that somebody has raided his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the Richard Alan Simmons' screenplay leaves unanswered in this trim, 82-minute oater. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition at a secret spot in the desert rather than keep it on the premises in the fort? No sooner have they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knock out of hero, and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white prospectors rides into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of ""Stalag 17"") brings in his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam is getting hot water to help in removing the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the shaft in deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had struck gold. The question of the dispersal of the gold is also left unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have one final pow-wow and Fire Knife demands that Adam hand over Major Ives or everybody will die. Naturally, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as a cavalryman gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a aimable Mexican scout pursued by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of ""West Side Story"") and Robert Bray of ""Lassie"" fame is on hand briefly as the ill-fated cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /><br />The biggest surprise in this unremarkable western shot on location in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women, and children at the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has been keeping a secret that he is a Native American, too! Ironically, the taut bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the outset of the hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" concludes on an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives furnish their respective reports about the issue to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to ""Casablanca"" scenarist Howard Koch. Ultimately, ""The Yellow Tomahawk"" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of ""Broken Arrow"" (1950) where the Native American is viewed as a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and the 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite its thin characters and familiar predicament. Calhoun stands out of an above-average cast as the always serviceable leading man, and good looking Castle is worth watching for her feminine charms. Peter Graves plays a skunk as was usual in most of his early roles. Actually, Lesley Selander did a more satisfactory dramatic version of this movie the year before called ""War Paint"" (1953) with Robert Stack.

PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the [[PS]] series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers.

Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series, the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words, to prevail, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, something which makes the always gray scenarios of the [[phosphorus]] series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers.

Nothing ""big"" happened to mark some sort of turning point in Australia's history.... until the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the Governor-general of Australia - [[John]] Kerr.<br /><br />For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonised by the British. As time went on, it became apparent that Australia was capable of standing on its own two feet. Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to establish its own parliaments, laws, courts and so on. The law and politics of Australia would no longer be provided directly from the British; rather, Australia would be run by Australians in their own right, even though the courts, precedents, parliament and so on is largely modeled on the British system. This [[shift]] was codified in the Australian Constitution. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes Australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious - no bill of rights), their are two ""pro-crown"" sections that were included and remain there to this day. These are more or less regarded as the ""reserve powers of the Crown (king/queen of [[Great]] Britain)."" The first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the Governor-general. Briefly, the governor-general is considered the Queen's chief representative in Australia and is described as the ""Executive"" branch of the Australian Government. When a piece of law is passed by the Australian parliament, the constitution states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the Governor-general. As such, the Govenor-general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber stamper performing an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the Crown. Theoretically, the Governor-general can refuse to sign a law passed by Australian parliament if he thinks fit. For instance, if parliament passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any Australian over the age of 50 (hypothetically of course) then the GG could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land. However, this power is theoretical and has (to date) never been exercised. By ""convention"" (which is the buzz word of the events leading to the dismissal), the Governor-general virtually acts at the behest of the Australian government and therefore, if the government passes law and the Prime Minister instructs the Governor-General to sign it, he will, almost always without question. In fact, by ""convention"" the Governor-General acts in accordance with the advice provided to him by the Prime Minister of the day (and the Prime Minister alone). The second aspect is section 64 of the constitution which states that the government ministers hold office at the Governor-general's ""pleasure."" Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - gave rise to a precedent on this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow 'displeased' with the government and/or Prime Minister, it would appear that this section allows him to lawfully sack the government (which happened in 1975... hence the title of the film ""the dismissal."") Whether 'at the Governor-General's pleasure' can be construed as ""the unfettered right to dismiss"" is a contentious point though that led to rather heated exchanges amongst Australians at the time - especially considering that the governor-general is not elected by the people of Australia.<br /><br />Now that this background aspect is out of the way, let's get back to discussing the film. It was well made. The pace was patient, but didn't drag at all. The drama was well contained and very realistic. It didn't over-dramatise the events and most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political perspective. On the contrary, I felt that it was fair and balanced, even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the film-makers probably didn't approve of the Governor-general's decision to dismiss the Whitlam government. But I wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other.<br /><br />In terms of accuracy, it was virtually spot on. The film-makers certainly did their homework and evidently read the books and writings from all the principle players concerned. There were a number of finer details that were somewhat skipped over, largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. Further, I think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post-Vietnam war era, but Noyce pretty much pulled it off.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual policies of both sides without becoming analytical, obsessive or judgmental over them. Moreover, any that we're raised, for example Connor's pipeline, had a great deal of relevance to the story. The film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the dismissal and not to present a political endorsement or opposition in relation to policies and viewpoints. This was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of misrepresenting one side's policies.<br /><br />The dismissal is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in Australia in its short life.

"""Stripperella"" is an [[animated]] series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper at a gentleman's club known as ""The [[Tender]] Loins"" and as a sexy crime-fighter known as Stripperella, a.k.a. Agent 69 who works for a government organization. As Stripperella, Erotica fights crime and the forces of evil such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them [[fat]] and Cheapo, a [[criminal]] who steals from 99 cent stores and makes his two henchmen [[share]] a gun. The creator of the character and the series is Stan Lee of Marvel fame (and creator of Spider-Man).<br /><br />[[Back]] in [[late]] June of 2003, [[Spike]] TV (then known as The New TNN) premiered a Thursday night block of three [[animated]] [[shows]]. Those [[shows]] were ""Ren & Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon""; new adventures of classic kids show characters Ren and Stimpy for adults done by original creator John Kricfalusi, ""Gary the Rat""; about a lawyer who is turned into a human sized rat starring Kelsee Grammar of ""Cheers"" and ""Fraiser"" fame, and ""Stripperella""; the adventures of a stripper who doubles as a superhero voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember seeing all three of the premiers. I was anxious to see Ren and Stimpy as I love the original show. I was a little [[let]] down. It was alright but it seemed to take things a little too far; seeing the two have gay sex together was a bit much. Though Gary the Rat wasn't bad, the best of the three was easily Stripperella. The animation was really good, it had an awesome intro song, it had some good talent behind it, and it was [[funny]] as hell! The show was just so [[silly]], I don't even know how to begin explaining it! After four of five weeks (if not a little less) the animation block disappeared, which was weird because I know it got good ratings and it was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Stripperella go but several months later I found out about new episodes that aired at like 1:00 AM. I only got to see one and though it was funny as hell and I was glad to see the show back after all that time, something seemed a bit off....<br /><br />In the beginning of it's short run, ""Stripperella"" had great animation. It was dark, moody, realistic, and somewhat sexy too. The Stripperella costumed looked good too, the character was drawn well. After the long hiatus and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was very different. Instead of dark and realistic look it originally had everything was now really colorful and cartoonish. Stripperella received the biggest changes though. Before she had normal long hair, now she had hair bigger than Peggy Bundy's (Married with Children) if even possible. Also, the eye mask actually shows her eyes now; before it was just white you saw which was cool since it was more superheroish. Also, the upper part of her costume was kind of a vest-type thing with a collar and her costume was dark blue; that changed to her costume being a bluish-violet color and her upper costume being really crappy looking in comparison. In short, the show was a cartoon and very over the top silly beforehand, but the second-half it became more cartoonish looking and though still laugh-out-loud hilarious, it became more zany as well; for example, there was a later episode about a were-beaver...yes, a were-beaver. <br /><br />Anyway, instead of complaining about the mid-series changes, ""Stripperella"" only ran one season but it was a very good show. Like the Tales from the Crypt film ""Bordello of Blood"", it may be really campy but it's really fun. As long as your not a prude you'll find yourself laughing repeatedly at this show. I haven't seen every episode because I haven't got the DVD yet for two reasons: #1. Paramount released and they have this screwed up policy about not including any extras on nearly all released TV shows, even though this was the entire show (I would have liked to see some commentary's maby explaining the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and #2. the awesome Kid Rock song during the opening was replaced. Now I'm not a fan of his, but that intro sang WAS the theme for the show! If your not going to pay to have any extras at least pay to have the original intro song you jack-asses. The show also had a few interesting guest stars such as John Lovitz as Cheapo and Mark Hamil as the plastic surgion who hates models. Also Tom Kenny (SpongeBob) was on the show as the owner of the strip club in most every episode. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode too.<br /><br />The Breakdown: <br /><br />PROS: Had a great look to it at first, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and see some of the stuff he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier.<br /><br />CONS: The mid-series animation change and the crappy DVD described earlier. Aside from the fact that some of the humor could be kind of dumb at times I have nothing really negative to say about this.<br /><br />OVERALL: Stripperella is a huge guilty pleasure of mine and it's a shame it only ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, actioned packed cult series that I hope to see air on Adult Swim someday with the original intro intact and possibly give it another season like Family Guy.

However, Amenábar has succeeded [[remarkably]] at portraying this [[man]], with his [[permanent]] enigmatic [[smile]] and witty [[sense]] of [[humour]], in an equally [[articulate]] and [[intelligent]] [[way]].<br /><[[br]] />And Javier Bardem [[rose]] to the occasion, [[met]] the [[challenge]] head-on, [[complete]] with a Galician [[accent]], [[producing]] an [[electrifying]], compelling, [[enthralling]] [[performance]], such that the actor and the [[fisherman]] become [[fused]] into being the same [[person]] on [[screen]]. Here, indeed, is an [[occasion]] to doff your [[cap]], and [[softly]] [[mutter]] 'chapeau'.

I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.<br /><br />Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual.

Sampedro was an articulate and [[healthy]] [[Man]] who after a [[dive]] accident off the [[stone]] of the Galician coast as a [[new]] [[humans]] was condemned to [[dwell]] the next 27 [[class]] in [[fuck]]. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) ([[television]]) was the [[kickoff]] [[interpretation]] of this man's [[liveliness]] on which [[single]] have already commented. However, Amenábar has succeeded [[signally]] at portraying this [[humanity]], with his [[lasting]] enigmatic [[grinning]] and witty [[sensation]] of [[temper]], in an equally [[formulate]] and [[reasoning]] [[mode]].<br /><[[BR]] />And Javier Bardem [[surface]] to the occasion, [[suffer]] the [[dispute]] head-on, [[staring]] with a Galician [[emphasize]], [[produce]] an [[wire]], compelling, [[ravish]] [[operation]], such that the actor and the [[fisher]] become [[amalgamated]] into being the same [[somebody]] on [[test]]. Here, indeed, is an [[affair]] to doff your [[jacket]], and [[lightly]] [[murmur]] 'chapeau'. Bardem is [[get]] on in his [[job]] by a [[splendid]] [[contrive]], [[specially]] Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (Los Lunes al Sol) (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan [[accent]] [[postulate]] [[big]] [[disunite]]. <br /><br />Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues as these six rotate among themselves one-on-one, or in groups, with excellent chemistry, thus demonstrating that this young Chilean-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is at and how to get his results; his global concept of the film includes his own music, interspersed with pieces by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record-player.<br /><br />Whilst viewing 'Mar Adentro', I found myself a couple of times comparing him and this film with Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece 'The Hours' (qv). I refer to the way in which the dialogues work with tenseness and passion and that careful sense of timing in each scene.<br /><br />Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is superb as usual. As I have mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he does not simply film the events and scenes - he captures even the feelings and the atmosphere of the moment, deftly catches that [[appear]] in the eyes, light and shadows, such that his work behind the camera is at once another player in the story. A superb artist.<br /><br />'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the best five or six works of art produced here in the last 25 years. This film places itself alongside such cinematographic art as 'El Sur' (qv), 'Los Santos Inocentes' (qv), 'El Abuelo' (qv), 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' (qv), 'Las Ratas' (qv), 'A Los Que Aman' (qv), and I think I must add 'Te Doy Mis Ojos' (qv).<br /><br />Superbly orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him [[about]] his bedside: not to be missed.",0.09927499294281006,0.11206275224685669,1,1,1,6184,"Failed"

When other [[kids]] had playstations, [[I]] was [[playing]] Zelda on my NES etc. [[Now]], this [[movie]] [[holds]] a [[special]] [[place]] in my [[heart]] already despite me being only 15 [[years]] [[old]] at the [[time]] of [[writing]] this [[review]]. [[I]], because of my 80's [[style]] early Childhood, [[watched]] many [[TV]] [[shows]] and [[saw]] Many [[movies]] that other [[kids]] didn't [[see]], and this [[movie]] was [[one]] of those, and [[one]] of the greatest too.<br /><[[br]] />It [[starts]] off in the Los Angeles [[home]] of Alvin Seville, Simon [[Seville]], Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the Chipmunk's [[adoptive]] [[father]], is in a [[rush]] to [[get]] to the [[airport]] as he is [[going]] on a [[business]] [[trip]] [[around]] Europe. His taxi is [[almost]] there and The Chipmunks [[help]] him pack. While they are [[talking]], Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to [[see]] the [[world]] ([[Even]] though, technically Dave is only going to [[Europe]], so to Alvin, [[apparently]] only America and Europe [[qualify]] as ''The World''). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of [[Miss]] Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. [[Soon]] Dave is off to the [[airport]] and the Chipmunks are left at home with [[Miss]] Miller. [[Later]], at a local Café the [[Chipmunks]] are playing a game of ''[[Around]] the [[World]] in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After [[losing]] the [[game]] to Brittany after having his [[Hot]] [[air]] Balloon [[eaten]] out of the [[sky]] by a crocodile, Alvin get's in an [[argument]] with Brittany about who would [[really]] [[win]] a [[race]] [[around]] the [[world]]. [[Two]] [[diamond]] [[smugglers]] [[sitting]] at a nearby [[table]], Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of [[transporting]] their [[diamonds]] over the [[world]], [[decide]] to fool the children into delivering them for them. They [[set]] up a race [[around]] the [[world]], where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop [[offs]] [[around]] the [[world]] and receive a [[doll]] in the opposing team's likeness (secretely [[filled]] with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. The [[winning]] team would then [[receive]] a 100.000 dollar [[reward]]. They do this because they [[believe]] that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the [[kids]] do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about [[life]], it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to [[draw]] from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian [[Prince]], a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money.

The [[victorious]] team would then [[welcome]] a 100.000 dollar [[wages]].

Mercifully, Chucky and the series has given up on Andy the ""Hide the Soul"" quest, and just settled for a new way out of his body. He [[squad]] up with his ex (Tilly) whom he [[transmit]] into a ""Bride"" doll and a couple of [[fair]] & Clyde teens (Really, Heigl?) to regain this pendant [[sink]] with Chucky's human corpse. This is for any Chucky fan, 1980s slasher-horror fans or even to those who's never seen any of the previous 'Child's Play' films. It's [[risible]], [[drab]], harmless, gory  but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes of [[covert]] time, it's always [[cracking]] to [[construe]] her.

"OK, it's easy not to confuse this with the lame Stuart Gordon movie called ""Death Bed"" that came out a few years back, because this one is ""The Bed That Eats"". And how do I even begin to describe this? Well, for starters, obviously there is a bed that eats.

The bed is in some old servant's quarters or something, and has been responsible for the disappearances of quite a few people in its time.

He died of consumption, one of the few people to lay in the bed that didn't get eaten, probably because he was sick, he theorizes, as we see him hacking blood into hankies.....bleah.

"So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy: Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. However, if you haven't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. Secondly, there is no character [[development]], without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. Of course, for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. One last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed.

In ""The Sea Serpent"", he hits rock [[bottom]] and takes some notable [[actors]] along with him, [[telling]] the [[tale]] of a silly [[sock]] monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature [[aquariums]].<br /><br />A vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an [[aborted]] military [[mission]] where American pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain.

The other two are the hilariously [[inept]] subtitle that declares the year to be ""1.985"" and Tyria Power's dated Sheena Easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.<br /><br />[[One]] of the [[kookiest]] monsters you will ever [[see]] [[rises]] from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb.

[[Through]] a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). None of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits the serpent is real, and it's not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. <br /><br />As illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away.

"Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out. Unlike these, the hero(es) weren't left holding an empty bag at the end.

The writers [[excelled]] at [[setting]] up hugely [[improbable]], if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to. explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet, for all that, still [[made]] sense. Too, I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underused, but when she was on screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. She was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he wasn't in the Department, he'd be working for the KGB or CIA. He's that sort of coldly efficient, ruthless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done. King? It's clearly a game to him. One he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job. He's probably the most fun to watch of the three, although they all have their moments and often, too. I do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original, however.","Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out.

Imagination, wit, acting which didn't always take itself too seriously ... [[1]] [[lack]] it. One reason being, I'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - BANACEK aside - which did as [[undecomposed]] a [[task]] of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat. The writers [[surpass]] at [[limit]] up hugely [[unconvincing]], if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to. explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet, for all that, still [[shit]] sense. Too, I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underused, but when she was on screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. She was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he wasn't in the Department, he'd be working for the KGB or CIA. He's that sort of coldly efficient, ruthless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done. King? It's clearly a game to him. One he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job. He's probably the most fun to watch of the three, although they all have their moments and often, too. I do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original, however.",0.10223919153213501,0.5910636186599731,1,0,1,2270,"Successful"

"Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet does nothing to dispel my particular impression that it is one of Shakespeare's most over-rated plays and Hamlet himself a not particularly moving and tragic character. I feel no sympathy for him, and I didn't after watching this.<br /><br />Even when you have great actors like the great Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde as Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he renders the entire role incomprehensible. I just could not connect his physicalisation of the character to what he was saying, and this killed it for me. That said, he does get the ""To be, or not to be"" speech right, as his actions with a dagger make clear the character's suicidal intentions at that point in the play.<br /><br />The supporting roles, to me better written and consequently better played, are enjoyable, notably Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius.<br /><br />At four and a half hours, it is very long and best watched in bite-sized chunks.

"Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment... and fair play to him. I always liked his image and his acting ability in such fare as Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you are going to get with Rourke - mean, moody, dirty. But this film gives you much more - and you don't want most of it.<br /><br />First and foremost - this [[whole]] thing just doesn't [[make]] [[sense]]. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after [[killing]] a bus-load of schoolchildren flees Ireland for London. He is on the [[run]] from the cops and from his own Army comrades. He has also vowed to never [[kill]] again. It looks like the bus full of kids finally did it for him.<br /><br />However, when he gets to London he is tracked down by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair came straight off a Burton's dummy) to kill his main competitor in turn for £50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do it but is [[seen]] by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in [[order]] to keep the priest's mouth shut. He figures it is [[better]] than killing him.<br /><br />A wealth of things arise here which just don't add up : <br /><br />1. Why pick Rourke to off your competition?

Why aren't the cops checking the place out? <br /><br />5. Rourke hangs around the church and Hoskin's blind niece in particular, for days afterward without anybody bothering him. What? He's on the run and he stays put by the very place where he committed another murder? Stupid.<br /><br />6. The cops actually meet Rourke in the church ""fixing"" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do they not know he is on the run for the school bus bombing? They don't even check up on him? <br /><br />7. Why get Rourke to kill for you, and then tell him to wait around for a few days to get on the boat? You'd think you'd want to get rid of him immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? <br /><br />8. Why does Bates' brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the midst of all the waiting? Could he not restrain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has been safely offed to the States? Ridiculous.<br /><br />9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all his years of killing and wins over the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a killer, she still loves him? Again - utterly ludicrous. And besides - she falls in ""love"" with him in record time - a few days !!!! <br /><br />10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just plain silly from Bates' point of view.<br /><br />11. Things happen in parts of this film that just do not make sense or are simply in there to help the storyline (and I say that in jest) along. Bates' houses Rourke in a whorehouse until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly displays a moral high ground to respect the whore in the house - but yet will bed a blind girl.<br /><br />12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically spurts out the entire movements of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke far more than he even asked.<br /><br />13. Hoskin's priest is an ex-army guy and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub.

"Throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the ""Partisans""  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who's generally only known in Eastern Europe, directed quite a few of these ""partisan"" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the Europe and the United States. ""Battle of the Eagles"" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force.<br /><br />Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.<br /><br />The film opens strongly with a well-shot German air raid on defenseless partisans. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure. All of the characters are familiar clichés: Major Dragan (played by a well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic, heroic leading man. He blasts away at strafing planes with a machine-gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous Klauberg (Radko Polic), a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic (""The Battle of Neretva"") is a Zare, a hotshot playboy; Bata Zivojinovic (""Hell River"") is Voss, a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic (""The Day that Shook the World"") is Dalibor, a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks, eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and Krvavac doesn't try to build upon these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, every player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has some great moments  when he's going to take his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed. The plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the Germans, and subsequent retaliatory acts.<br /><br />Krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and false-looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable. Some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real, while dogfights involving scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are just plain pathetic. Sometimes smoke puffs from the ""machine-guns"" are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane. Worse, the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage. Although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective, they're surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism. All of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by Bojan Adamic.<br /><br />""Battle of the Eagles"" also suffers from a very poorly edited English-language release. To begin with, 28 minutes of footage is missing  cutting the film from 130 minutes to a mere 102. The missing segments were carelessly excised, and the cutting looks very sloppy. Music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only some badly-needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. Then, there's the dubbing all of the scenes revolving around the Partisans are dubbed in English (rather poorly, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in German, without the benefit of subtitles. The film might have made much more sense had the German-language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the Partisans.<br /><br />On the plus side, Krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well. There is never a moment where the audience feels like they're on a soundstage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets. The scenery is fresh and green, and Krvavac isn't afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek. A German ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out, as does a sequence where Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base.<br /><br />As it exists on home video, ""Battle of the Eagles"" is just another of many stories about the Yugoslav Partisan movement. There is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid this one unless you can find a full-length copy.","Throughout the 1950s and into the 60s, 70s and even into the 80s, a slew of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the ""Partisans""  civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who's generally only known in Eastern Europe, directed quite a few of these ""partisan"" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the Europe and the United States. ""Battle of the Eagles"" is a rare, low-budget look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force.<br /><br />Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to combat the German Luftwaffe in the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys; over the course of several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable  whatever it is, it sure isn't convincing, but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work.<br /><br />The film opens strongly with a well-shot German air raid on defenseless partisans. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action starts, and this title quickly becomes yet another low-budget, by-the-numbers adventure.

"If all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared, Death in Venice would have to be it. It is a monument in movie history. Much criticized for being slow, boring and too obvious in stating it's point (an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed, first mentally, then physically), we should appreciate this movie for what it is. 'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Life was slow then, compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by Gustav Mahler.<br /><br />This movie is [[slow]], there is no denying it. No special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. No perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.<br /><br />So, basically, nothing much happens in this movie?

Another [[one]] of ""those"". [[A]] tear jerker. A bucket [[movie]]. A [[morality]] [[tail]]. [[Yeah]], [[I]] [[know]], [[I]] [[hate]] those too. [[Only]] this [[one]] isn't. It is [[one]] of the very few [[movies]] among those many I have seen that [[pulls]] off a very rare trick: it conveys a [[truly]] [[sad]] story (and yes, a morality [[tale]]) but without a [[single]] [[moment]] where it [[feels]] [[cheesy]], [[forced]] or in any other [[way]] ""hollywoody"". It shows a [[REAL]] relationship between two REAL [[boys]], who interact as [[REAL]] kids do. And through that interaction the good-natured, [[loving]] [[character]] of the [[older]] boy, Eric, starts to [[shine]] through his ""tough-guy"" persona, as he [[takes]] on a [[kind]] of big-brotherly [[care]] for Dexter, his HIV-positive [[younger]] neighbor. Together, they [[embark]] on an adventure to [[find]] a cure - which to Erik seems to be just [[around]] the corner - so that all this [[silly]] [[AIDS]] [[thing]] will [[go]] [[away]] and they can be friends forever.<br /><br />The [[production]] is [[top]] [[notch]]. [[But]], of [[course]], what really [[carries]] this [[movie]], is the [[performances]] of the two [[leads]] - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. [[Especially]] Mazzello, who is [[simply]] [[stunning]] - he does [[convey]] a [[sense]] of [[frailty]] [[needed]] for an ailing boy, but at the same time he manages to [[make]] Dexter a [[truly]] energetic and [[determined]] [[character]]. He [[shines]] at the [[scene]] where the [[boys]] confront Pony: his [[impulse]] to protect his [[older]] [[friend]] [[lunges]] him [[forth]], [[drives]] him to [[say]] what he [[says]] - and only [[afterwards]], the horror is depicted on his [[face]], as he realizes that what he himself said is true: his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother: he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is [[left]] completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to Erik as well.<br /><br />I've first seen this film when I was at school back in America, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously, will Americans ever [[get]] over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable [[shot]] of a playboy [[cover]] in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the ""official"" after-school specials put together.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless... The score. It's great. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records: he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.<br /><br />All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.

Characterization here is top notch, and it's hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she's such a playful being who doesn't hide her emotions - if she's upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!<br /><br />Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film, so don't you [[Adam]] missing this on the big screen!",0.09816426038742065,0.1111493706703186,1,1,1,6608,"Failed"
"[[In]] Cold Mountain, [[North]] Colorado, [[near]] to the [[period]] of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the [[small]] town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health [[reasons]]. Ada meets the also shy Inman (Jude Law), and they [[fall]] in [[love]] with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great [[support]] to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold [[Mountain]] again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The [[story]] [[alternates]] present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful [[romance]]. I liked this film a [[lot]]. Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and [[seven]] indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'","[[indium]] Cold Mountain, [[northwards]] Colorado, [[skinny]] to the [[point]] of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the [[humble]] town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health [[conclude]].

"Hailing from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most [[frustrating]] Fulci [[film]] I've [[seen]] to [[date]], prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get [[worse]] as you get later into his career. [[Considering]] the [[plot]] synopsis, [[I]] was [[expecting]] some bloody bad-natured fun with this [[one]], but for all its bizarre [[flourishes]], it [[feels]] tedious [[even]] at a [[running]] [[time]] of just 80 minutes, and [[suffers]] from nauseatingly [[shabby]] [[production]] [[values]] and film-making [[craft]] (or lack thereof).<br /><br />El [[Story]]: A [[gambling]] [[addict]] widower [[wines]] and dines rich (and strange) women he finds via lonely hearts [[columns]] before offing them in gruesome fashion - sometimes eating them or [[feeding]] them to animals - and stealing their money to [[keep]] his debtors at bay. Sure, it's unlikely that just [[one]] [[man]] would be the host for so much screwed-up pathology all at once ([[addict]], psycho/sociopath, [[cannibal]]), but this is Fulci!<br /><br />Touch is actually the [[cheapest]] and sparsest [[looking]] Fulci film I've [[seen]]. There's [[almost]] [[nobody]] in it, even in the background of shots out on the street, for [[instance]]. A newsreader who keeps appearing on the film's televisions to warn the non-existent [[cast]] about the maniac's [[latest]] doings [[operates]] out of the most [[pathetic]] [[TV]] studio on the planet. He never [[even]] [[gets]] to look at the camera because has to read all the headlines off misaligned [[sheets]] of paper.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Some]] [[scenes]] just [[go]] on and on with the protagonist [[muttering]] to himself about what he's [[done]] or what he's about to do, but the [[acting]] is nowhere [[near]] [[good]] enough to [[sustain]] this [[kind]] of thing, so the [[main]] [[outcome]] is [[viewer]] boredom. The [[film]] [[also]] [[looks]] bland and [[ugly]] in general. I've [[read]] that it was [[intended]] to be an Italian telemovie (did it [[ever]] [[screen]] in that venue? With the [[amount]] of [[gore]] [[involved]], it [[seems]] unlikely), and it does reek of crappy [[old]] telemovie [[production]] [[values]].<br /><br />This is also Fulci's [[first]] [[foray]] into [[outright]] [[black]] humour, but he's just too [[graceless]] a director to [[make]] it [[work]]. Sometimes conspicuously cheerful or 'wacky' [[music]] is used to play against a gruesome scene, for instance while the hero/villain is carving up a dead body in his basement. The effect isn't really chilling or funny or ironic anything that you'd like it to be - it's mostly just hamfisted and crappy.<br /><br />There are of course some redeeming moments of gore (that you'll be waiting for while trying to stay awake), including the eventual murder by oven(!) of a woman who just won't quit life, even after her face has been totally bashed apart with a bloody great club, and a homeless guy who gets a car run back and forth over him about five times. The most outrageous element of Touch, however, is all the physical deformation on the widows courted by the crazy guy. Beards, hairy moles, messy harelips - it's not like he sought out women with these features, it's just the way all lonely hearts widows are, apparently. There are plenty of shots of Mr Crazy secretly grimacing while he's smooching up these women. The black humour of such garish misogyny might have some staying power or resonance if the film wasn't so poorly executed in general. In the end, Touch Of Death just seems like a really lazy, inarticulate mess.","Hailing from 1988, Touch Of Death is probably the most [[queer]] Fulci [[cinema]] I've [[encounter]] to [[appointment]], prompting me to join the chorus of horror fans who generalise that his films get [[defective]] as you get later into his career.
