"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fix𝚝ure]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"James [[Edwin]] [[Campbell]] (July [[7]], [[1843]] – [[December]] [[18]], 1924) was a [[Democratic]] [[politician]] from Ohio. He served as the 38th Governor of Ohio. Campbell was [[born]] in [[Middletown]], Ohio where he [[attended]] the public schools and then [[Miami]] University. He [[served]] in the Union Army as a [[member]] of the Mississippi River [[Squadron]] during the [[Civil]] War. He was a [[master's]] mate on the [[gunboats]] Elk and [[Naiad]] until his health [[gave]] out and he returned home emaciated. James Campbell was [[admitted]] to the [[bar]] in [[1865]] and [[began]] practicing [[law]] in Hamilton, Ohio two years [[later]]. [[Campbell]] was [[married]] to [[Maud]] Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on [[January]] 4, 1870. They had four [[children]]. He was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a [[prosecutor]] in [[Butler]] County, Ohio from [[1876]]–[[1880]], Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States [[House]] of Representatives twice from Ohio's [[7th]] congressional district ([[Forty-eighth]] and Fiftieth Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from [[1884-1889]]. In the [[49th]] [[Congress]], he was [[chairman]] of the House [[Committee]] on Alcoholic [[Liquor]] Traffic. Campbell then was elected to the Ohio [[governorship]], serving from 1890 to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in [[1891]], losing to future [[president]] [[William]] [[McKinley]]. During his [[term]] as governor, he signed a bill [[enacting]] the [[Australian]] [[ballot]] in Ohio. He [[called]] a special session of the General [[Assembly]] to remove the [[corrupt]] [[government]] of the city of Cincinnati. [[This]] action cost him the support of [[Democrats]] in that part of the state, and [[prevented]] his [[re-election]]. He was [[unsuccessful]] in a third run for [[governor]] in 1895. [[Campbell]] was a trustee of the Ohio [[State]] University [[1895-1896]]. Remaining [[politically]] [[active]], [[Campbell]] was a delegate to the Democratic National [[Conventions]] in 1892, [[1920]], and [[1924]]. He served on the [[commission]] to codify the State of Ohio [[laws]] from [[1908-1911]]. Campbell was nominated for [[Congress]] in 1906, but lost, and was his [[party's]] choice for Senator in 1908, but was again [[defeated]]. In 1913, [[Campbell]] was appointed a [[trustee]] of the [[Ohio]] Archaeological and [[Historical]] Society, and he was [[elected]] unanimously by the Board of Trustees as president on September 25, [[1918]]. He served as president until his [[death]]. He resumed the practice of law in Columbus, Ohio after 1892 and died there in [[1924]].

"[[Cettiidae]] is a newly [[validated]] family of small [[insectivorous]] songbirds (\""[[warblers]]\""), formerly [[placed]] in the Old World [[warbler]] \""[[wastebin]]\"" [[assemblage]]. [[It]] [[contains]] the typical [[bush]] warblers (Cettia) and their [[relatives]]. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. Its [[members]] [[occur]] mainly in [[Asia]] and Africa, ranging into Oceania and [[Europe]]. [[The]] monarch warblers ([[Erythrocercus]]), tit [[hylia]] [[Pholidornis]] and [[green]] [[hylia]] ([[Hylia]]) are exclusively [[found]] in the [[forests]] of [[Africa]]. The pseudo-tailorbirds, tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and [[Abroscopus]] [[warblers]] are mostly found in the forests of south and southeastern [[Asia]], with one [[species]] reaching as [[far]] north as Japan and [[Siberia]]. The genus Cettia has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe [[across]] Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Palau. Most of the species in the genus are sedentary, but the [[Asian]] [[stubtail]] is wholly migratory and the [[Japanese]] bush [[warbler]] and [[Cetti's]] warbler are partly migratory over much of their range. A few species, such as the [[pale-footed]] bush warbler, are [[altitudinal]] [[migrants]]. [[The]] species are small, stubby [[birds]]. [[Most]] have [[moderately]] long to long tails, while the [[stubtails]] and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is [[typically]] [[clad]] in [[dull]] [[plumage]], often with a line above the eye. Some, [[like]] the [[monarch]] [[warblers]] ([[Erythrocercus]]), are [[much]] different in appearance, having areas of bright [[yellow]] [[plumage]]. Altogether the Cettiidae are a quite variable group [[containing]] [[many]] aberrant [[birds]] that hitherto had been uncomfortably placed with a wide range of [[unrelated]] [[families]].

In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.",0.4050649404525757,0.6834572553634644,0,1,0,173,"Successful"

[[This]] bird was formerly [[considered]] the same [[species]] as [[Turdoides]] melanops of [[southern]] Africa, now [[known]] as the black-faced [[babbler]]. [[These]] [[birds]] are [[mostly]] [[grey-brown]] with [[white]] mottling, [[especially]] on the underparts, that varies according to [[location]] and the individual. The population near [[Nanyuki]], Kenya, is darker but can have a [[pure]] white chin or entire throat. The combination of pale yellow or white eyes and [[black]] lores (the areas between the eye and the [[bill]]) [[separates]] adults of this species from similar [[babblers]] [[except]] melanops, though all juvenile babblers have [[brown]] [[eyes]]. In Kenya, [[single]] birds give [[repeated]] single or [[double]] harsh notes such as waaach or a [[muffled]] [[kurr-ack]]; pairs or groups give [[longer]] phrases in chorus. The tempo is [[frequently]] slow for a [[babbler]]. They are most vocal in the early morning and late afternoon. Like other Turdoides, it is found low or on the ground in or near dense woody [[vegetation]], including in [[cultivated]] areas. Kenyan birds forage in [[bushes]] and [[tall]] [[grass]]. They are \""restless, noisy, and suspicious\"" and \""typical gregarious [[babblers]]\"". Single [[birds]] give repeated [[single]] or double [[harsh]] notes such as waaach or a muffled kurr-ack; [[pairs]] or [[groups]] [[give]] [[longer]] [[phrases]] in chorus. [[The]] tempo is frequently slow for a babbler.

"Dark Discoveries is an [[internationally]] [[distributed]], [[quarterly]] [[slick]] [[magazine]] formerly published by Dark Discoveries [[Publications]], and now published by Journalstone, [[LLC]]. It [[focuses]] primarily on the horror fiction, dark [[fantasy]], and [[science]] fiction [[genres]]. [[The]] magazine's content [[includes]] [[short]] [[fiction]], [[interviews]], nonfiction articles, [[profiles]] of industry [[notables]], and is [[fully]] [[illustrated]]. Dark [[Discoveries]] Publications was originally founded in January, [[2004]] by James R. Beach of [[Longview]], WA. The [[magazine]] began as a black and [[white]] [[periodical]] with [[David]] Emrich, of [[David]] Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from [[2004]] to [[2007]]. [[Together]] Editor-in-chief [[Beach]] and designer Emrich created the basic [[look]] and [[feel]] of the magazine that continued through the first [[ten]] issues. [[Designer]] Cesar Puch briefly took over the [[layout]] for two issues in [[2008]], but left for a [[job]] with Bad [[Moon]] [[Books]] after that.

Brock [[left]] the magazine and the [[website]] in mid-2012; his last [[full]] issue was #[[19]], which [[focused]] on [[extreme]] horror, though some of his ideas for [[topics]] were utilized into [[2013]], and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to [[new]] staff [[following]] [[Brock's]] departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror [[literary]] publication Nameless [[Digest]], published by Cycatrix Press. Dark Discoveries, both the magazine and name, were [[purchased]] by JournalStone, [[LLC]]. [[Owner]]/President [[Christopher]] C. Payne in [[August]], [[2012]]. [[The]] page count was expanded, the format changed to a [[perfect-bound]] magazine, and color was added to all of the pages, the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all [[concepts]] Brock had [[predicted]] would be needed to continue the magazine).

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation [[1982]] SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was [[discovered]] by American [[female]] astronomer [[Eleanor]] [[Helin]] on 30 [[September]] [[1982]], at the U.S. [[Palomar]] Observatory in California. The [[bright]] [[E-type]] [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the [[Hungaria]] family, which [[form]] the innermost dense concentration of [[asteroids]] in the Solar System. The asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a [[distance]] of 1.[[7]]–2.1 AU once [[every]] 2 [[years]] and [[8]] [[months]] (977 [[days]]). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an eccentricity of [[0]].11 and an [[inclination]] of 22° with [[respect]] to the [[ecliptic]]. [[The]] [[first]] [[observation]] was taken at Crimea–[[Nauchnij]] in [[1974]], extending the [[asteroid's]] [[observation]] arc by [[8]] years prior to its [[discovery]]. In [[March]] 2005, a [[rotational]] light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer [[Brian]] D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), [[Colorado]]. It gave a [[long]] [[rotation]] period of 105.7±[[0]].[[1]] hours with a [[brightness]] variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). [[The]] period was derived from a [[re-examined]] light-curve that originally gave a [[much]] shorter period of 30.72±[[0]].[[02]] hours with an amplitude of [[0]].37 in magnitude (U=[[0]]). This [[previously]] [[published]] period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the [[survey]] carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of [[NASA's]] [[Wide-field]] Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative [[Asteroid]] [[Lightcurve]] Link  assumes an albedo of [[0]].30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and [[0]].[[2]], corresponding to the [[Hungaria]] asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an [[absolute]] magnitude of 13.[[7]]. [[The]] minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the [[city]] [[council's]] efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see [[dark-sky]] movement). [[Palomar]] [[mountain]] is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the [[light]] pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the [[observatory]].

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. [[Hops]] [[Infusion]] is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for [[aging]] bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into [[Blasphemy]]. These [[four]] styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), [[Phil]] Lesh ([[bass]], [[vocals]]), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played [[together]] in [[various]] San Francisco bands, including [[Mother]] McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had [[played]] [[bass]] for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of [[McKernan]], who [[died]] in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band [[stayed]] together for its [[entire]] [[30-year]] history.

Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009.

The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), [[Phiⅼ]] Lesh ([[basѕ]], [[vocalѕ]]), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played [[togetheⲅ]] in [[variouѕ]] San Francisco bands, including [[Motheⲅ]] McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had [[playeԁ]] [[bas]] for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of [[McKernn]], who [[dieԁ]] in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band [[staуed]] together for its [[entiⲅe]] [[30-yer]] history.

Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009.

"Willie “The [[Wisp]]” [[Galimore]] ([[March]] 30, [[1935]] – [[July]] [[27]], [[1964]]) was an [[American]] football running [[back]] for the [[Chicago]] Bears from [[1957]]–[[1963]]. He attended Florida A&M University, working with the [[legendary]] coach Jake [[Gaither]]. Galimore is a member of the [[College]] [[Football]] Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and [[lateral]] [[movement]]; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they [[believed]] [[Galimore]] could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a [[straight]] line. [[His]] running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was [[probably]] the [[last]] great [[find]] before NFL [[scouting]] became sophisticated. [[Bears]] assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's [[prowess]] as a halfback, and the [[Bears]] subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 [[NFL]] [[draft]]. [[Galimore's]] peers (including Chuck [[Bednarik]] and Doug Atkins) [[referred]] to [[Galimore]] as one of the best [[runners]] they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on [[July]] 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the [[age]] of [[29]] with teammate Bo Farrington. His number [[28]] has been [[retired]] by the Bears. [[His]] son, Ron [[Galimore]], was the [[first]] Black U.S. [[Olympic]] gymnast. Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a [[guest]] at the previously all-white Ponce [[de]] Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old [[mother]] of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had [[made]] national headlines a few months before).

A community center in the historic Lincolnville neighborhood of the city also [[bears]] Galimore's [[name]], and he is [[depicted]] on a historical mural painted by [[schoolchildren]] on Washington Street.","Willie “The [[Wi]] [[sp]]” [[Galіmore]] ([[Mɑrch]] 30, [[135]] – [[Juⅼy]] [[2𝟕]], [[196Ꮞ]]) was an [[Ameriϲan]] football running [[b]] [[ack]] for the [[Chiϲago]] Bears from [[195𝟕]]–[[l963]]. He attended Florida A&M University, working with the [[legendaⲅy]] coach Jake [[Gaіther]]. Galimore is a member of the [[Colⅼege]] [[Foоtball]] Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and [[lateraⅼ]] [[m]] [[ovement]]; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they [[believeԁ]] [[Gɑlimore]] could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a [[straigh𝚝]] line. [[Hiѕ]] running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was [[proabbly]] the [[las𝚝]] great [[finԁ]] before NFL [[scou𝚝ing]] became sophisticated. [[Bearѕ]] assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's [[prowesѕ]] as a halfback, and the [[Bearѕ]] subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 [[NL]] [[draf𝚝]]. [[Galіmore's]] peers (including Chuck [[Bedanrik]] and Doug Atkins) [[referreԁ]] to [[Galimoⲅe]] as one of the best [[runnerѕ]] they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on [[Juⅼy]] 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the [[ae]] of [[2৭]] with teammate Bo Farrington. His number [[2Ȣ]] has been [[retireԁ]] by the Bears. [[Hs]] son, Ron [[Ga]] [[limore]], was the [[fist]] Black U.S. [[Olympiϲ]] gymnast. Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a [[gues𝚝]] at the previously all-white Ponce [[ԁe]] Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old [[motheⲅ]] of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had [[maԁe]] national headlines a few months before). [[Galimore'ѕ]] civil rights activism is honored with a Freedom Trail [[markeⲅ]] at his home at 57 Chapin Street in St. [[Augus𝚝ine]].

"[[Steven]] [[Lynn]] \""[[Steve]]\"" [[Beshear]] ([[born]] [[September]] [[21]], 1944) is an [[American]] attorney and [[Democratic]] [[Party]] politician who was the [[61st]] Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015. He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the [[49th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor from 1983 to 1987. [[After]] graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear [[briefly]] practiced law in [[New]] York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a [[consumer]] [[advocate]]. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney [[general]], serving under [[Governor]] John Y. [[Brown]], Jr. As attorney [[general]], Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with [[first]] lady [[Phyllis]] George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated [[governor's]] mansion. In [[1983]], Beshear was elected [[lieutenant]] [[governor]] in the administration of [[Governor]] [[Martha]] [[Layne]] Collins. [[His]] most [[significant]] [[action]] in this capacity was the [[formation]] of the [[Kentucky]] Tomorrow [[Commission]], a [[panel]] charged with [[making]] recommendations for the future of the [[state]]. [[Beshear's]] initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election.

[[For]] the [[next]] 20 [[years]], Beshear [[practiced]] law at a [[Lexington]] law [[firm]]. [[His]] only foray into [[politics]] during this period was an [[unsuccessful]] challenge to [[Senator]] Mitch [[McConnell]] in 1996. In 2007, [[however]], [[Beshear]] was [[drawn]] back into [[politics]] by the vulnerability of [[incumbent]] Republican [[Governor]] Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by [[then-Attorney]] General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the [[state's]] merit system. In the [[2007]] gubernatorial [[election]], Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social [[programs]] like [[education]] – and defeated Fletcher in the [[general]] election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, [[defeating]] Republican [[David]] L. Williams and [[Independent]] Gatewood Galbraith.

[[First]] [[described]] scientifically by Christian Hendrik [[Persoon]] in [[1794]], G. quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan—but not [[common]]—[[species]] of [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, [[feeding]] off decomposing [[organic]] [[matter]] [[present]] in the [[soil]] and [[litter]] of coniferous [[forests]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The [[Taradale]] [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over [[Back]] Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the [[Bendigo]] Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and [[O'Hara]] The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, under the supervision of British [[Railway]] engineer [[Isambard]] Kingdom [[Brunel]]. [[The]] [[foundation]] stone was laid by [[Mr]]. W. S. [[Urquhart]] Wednesday [[25]] [[September]] [[1861]] The contract for the [[first]] stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the [[permanent]] way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. [[Clarke]] clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian [[Railways]]. [[William]] [[Edward]] Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria.

It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and [[O'Haⲅa]] The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of [[Chipрenham]], Wiltshire, under the supervision of British [[Railԝay]] engineer [[Isambad]] Kingdom [[Brսnel]].

[[Urqhart]] Wednesday [[2Ƽ]] [[Septembeⲅ]] [[1Ȣ61]] The contract for the [[firs𝚝]] stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the [[permanen𝚝]] way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. [[Clar𝒌e]] clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian [[Railwayѕ]].

"[[Sir]] Matthew [[Hale]] SL (1 [[November]] 1609 – [[25]] December 1676) was an [[influential]] [[English]] [[barrister]], [[judge]] and [[lawyer]] most [[noted]] for his [[treatise]] [[Historia]] Placitorum [[Coronæ]], or [[The]] History of the [[Pleas]] of the [[Crown]]. [[Born]] to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was [[raised]] by his [[father's]] [[relative]], a [[strict]] Puritan, and [[inherited]] his [[faith]]. In [[1626]] he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to [[become]] a [[priest]], but after a [[series]] of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father [[thanks]] to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a [[dispute]] over his [[estate]]. On [[8]] November [[1628]] he [[joined]] [[Lincoln's]] [[Inn]], where he was [[called]] to the [[Bar]] on 17 May [[1636]]. [[As]] a [[barrister]], Hale [[represented]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[William]] [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that [[Hale]] was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] used. [[Despite]] the Royalist loss, [[Hale's]] reputation for integrity and his political neutrality [[saved]] him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of [[England]] he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which [[investigated]] [[law]] [[reform]]. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] [[Pleas]]. [[As]] a [[judge]], Hale was noted for his [[resistance]] to [[bribery]] and his [[willingness]] to [[make]] politically unpopular decisions which [[upheld]] the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in [[every]] Parliament from the [[First]] [[Protectorate]] Parliament to the [[Convention]] Parliament, and [[following]] the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider [[Charles]] [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the [[English]] Restoration. [[Under]] [[Charles]], Hale was made [[first]] Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King's]] [[Bench]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly [[innovative]] judge. [[Following]] a bout of illness he [[retired]] on 20 February 1676, dying ten months [[later]] on 25 [[December]] 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia [[Placitorum]] Coronæ, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common [[Law]] is noted as the first published history of English [[law]] and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Siⲅ]] Matthew [[Hlae]] SL (1 [[Novembeⲅ]] 1609 – [[2Ƽ]] December 1676) was an [[iոfluential]] [[Engliѕh]] [[barristeⲅ]], [[juԁge]] and [[lawyeⲅ]] most [[noteԁ]] for his [[treatiѕe]] [[Histoⲅia]] Placitorum [[Co]] [[ronæ]], or [[Te]] History of the [[Peas]] of the [[Croԝn]].

[[Aѕ]] a [[barristeⲅ]], Hale [[represeոted]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[Williaｍ]] [[Lad]]; it has been hypothesised that [[Haⅼe]] was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the [[defenϲe]] [[Charleѕ]] used. [[Despi𝚝e]] the Royalist loss, [[Hale`s]] reputation for integrity and his political neutrality [[saveԁ]] him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of [[Englanԁ]] he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which [[investigateԁ]] [[laԝ]] [[reforｍ]]. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver [[Cromwelⅼ]] made him a Justice of the [[Commоn]] [[Pleaѕ]]. [[Aѕ]] a [[juԁge]], Hale was noted for his [[resistanϲe]] to [[bribeⲅy]] and his [[willingnesѕ]] to [[ma𝒌e]] politically unpopular decisions which [[uphelԁ]] the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in [[eveⲅy]] Parliament from the [[Firs𝚝]] [[Protectora𝚝e]] Parliament to the [[Conven𝚝ion]] Parliament, and [[folloԝing]] the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider [[Charleѕ]] [[II]] '[[s]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the [[Engliѕh]] Restoration. [[Undeⲅ]] [[Charleѕ]], Hale was made [[firs𝚝]] Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King'ѕ]] [[Benϲh]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly [[innovatiѵe]] judge. [[Folloԝing]] a bout of illness he [[retireԁ]] on 20 February 1676, dying ten months [[lateⲅ]] on 25 [[Decembeⲅ]] 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia [[Placitоrum]] Coronæ, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common [[L]] [[aw]] is noted as the first published history of English [[l]] [[aw]] and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.",0.05224233865737915,0.21142452955245972,0,0,0,2063,"Failed"

Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli.

It starts at the confluence of the [[Ohau]] River and the Tekapo River, now in the head of the [[artificial]] Lake Benmore, these rivers being fed by [[three]] large glacial [[lakes]], Pukaki, Tekapo, and [[Ohau]]. The Waitaki flows through Lake [[Benmore]], [[Lake]] Aviemore and Lake Waitaki, these lakes being contained by hydroelectric [[dams]], Benmore Dam, [[Aviemore]] Dam and [[Waitaki]] Dam. The Waitaki has several [[tributaries]], notably the Ahuriri River and the [[Hakataramea]] River. It [[passes]] Kurow and Glenavy before entering the Pacific Ocean. The river’s flow is normally low in winter, with [[flows]] increasing in spring when the snow [[cloaking]] the Southern Alps begins to melt, with flows throughout the [[summer]] being rainfall dependent and then declining in the autumn as the colder weather begins to freeze the [[smaller]] streams and streams which feed the catchment. The [[median]] flow of the Waitaki River at Kurow is [[356]] cubic metres [[per]] second (12,600 cu ft/s).

"[[The]] SM [[Kirov]] [[Stadium]] was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in St. [[Petersburg]], Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums [[anywhere]] in the [[world]].

Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and [[resumed]] in [[1945]] with the [[return]] of citizens to [[Leningrad]]. Thousands of [[Red]] Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction.

"Dave [[Parkinson]] was an [[Australian]] [[professional]] [[rugby]] [[league]] footballer of the 1940s and 1950s.

A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

Tilicho Lake is the destination of one of the most [[populaⲅ]] side hikes of the [[Annapur]] [[na]] [[Circսit]] [[tre𝒌]]. The hike takes additional 3–[[Ꮞ]] days. No camping is required, as [[nw]] lodges have been built between Manang and the [[la𝒌e]]. Final [[approaϲh]] to the lake is done in a day hike from the lodge at [[Tilіcho]] Base [[Cap]]. Trekkers attempting the Annapurna Circuit route [[usualⅼy]] cross the [[watersed]] between Manang and Kali Gandaki valleys over the 5416 [[meterѕ]] high Thorong [[Lɑ]] pass. [[Thе]] [[alterna𝚝e]] [[rou𝚝e]] skirting Tilicho Lake from the [[nor𝚝h]] has been gaining popularity. This route is more demanding and requires at least one night of camping. There are no teahouses or lodges [[pas𝚝]] the Tilicho Base Camp lodge some kilometers [[eas𝚝]] of the lake and the next village of [[Thii]] Gaon in the [[Kaⅼi]] Gandaki valley. Most [[groսps]] [[speոd]] [[to]] nights between these places.
