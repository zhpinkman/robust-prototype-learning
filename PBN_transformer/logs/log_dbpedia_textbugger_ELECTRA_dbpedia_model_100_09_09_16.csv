"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixùöùure]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season.

"The Raid on Griessie was a British [[attack]] on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed [[Gresik]]) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars.

"[[Northampton]] /[[n…îÀêÀàŒ∏√¶mpt…ôn]]/ is the county [[town]] of [[Northamptonshire]] in the East Midlands of England.

"Malcolm Musgrove (8 [[July]] 1933 ‚àí 14 September [[2007]]) was an [[English]] [[football]] [[player]] and [[manager]].

He left Orient in 1965 to [[coach]] [[Charlton]] Athletic under [[Bob]] Stokoe, from where he moved to Aston Villa in [[1967]]. In [[late]] 1968, he joined Leicester City as [[assistant]] manager under former [[West]] Ham team-mate Frank [[O'Farrell]], taking them back to the top flight when they won the Division [[2]] Championship in [[1970]]‚Äì71.

On his [[return]], [[two]] years [[later]], he became coach/physio at Plymouth Argyle, where he [[stayed]] until joining former Hammer John Bond at Shrewsbury Town. There, he was part of the backroom staff when they won the Third Division [[title]] in [[1993]], before retiring in [[1998]].

Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri [[Lanùíåan]] [[insrer]] [[Avva]] NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and [[Si]] Lanka's National [[Developmenùöù]] Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an [[exclusi—µe]] [[20-yea‚≤Ö]] bancassurance agreement with [[N]] [[DB]], one of [[S‚≤Öi]] Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a [[nationwi‘Åe]] bank [[branœ≤h]] network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash [[consideratoin]] of ‚Ç¨[[l]].[[36]] [[bil‚Öºion]] (US$[[l]].73 billion). In December [[201·íø]], AIA was informed by AIG that [[AG]] had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a [[pirce]] of HK$30.30 per [[s]] [[hare]]. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.[[6‡ß≠]]% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur.

[[The]] magazine's content [[includes]] [[short]] [[fiction]], [[interviews]], nonfiction articles, [[profiles]] of industry [[notables]], and is [[fully]] [[illustrated]]. Dark [[Discoveries]] Publications was originally founded in January, [[2004]] by James R. Beach of [[Longview]], WA.

[[Together]] Editor-in-chief [[Beach]] and designer Emrich created the basic [[look]] and [[feel]] of the magazine that continued through the first [[ten]] issues. [[Designer]] Cesar Puch briefly took over the [[layout]] for two issues in [[2008]], but left for a [[job]] with Bad [[Moon]] [[Books]] after that. Dark [[Discoveries]] then [[became]] a color [[publication]] in [[2009]] after Jason V [[Brock]] became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni [[Productions]], [[LLC]], who also [[maintained]] the [[Dark]] Discoveries [[website]]) and [[Art]] Director in [[2008]], helping to [[salvage]] the [[magazine]] from being discontinued by publisher Beach. [[Among]] many novel ideas and new [[perspectives]] introduced by Brock ([[editorially]], visually, and [[content-wise]]) was the [[concept]] of having each issue [[follow]] a [[topic]] to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a [[renewed]] focus on media [[outside]] of the [[small]] press, namely [[film]], [[television]], and the art [[world]]. Brock [[left]] the magazine and the [[website]] in mid-2012; his last [[full]] issue was #[[19]], which [[focused]] on [[extreme]] horror, though some of his ideas for [[topics]] were utilized into [[2013]], and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to [[new]] staff [[following]] [[Brock's]] departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror [[literary]] publication Nameless [[Digest]], published by Cycatrix Press. Dark Discoveries, both the magazine and name, were [[purchased]] by JournalStone, [[LLC]]. [[Owner]]/President [[Christopher]] C. Payne in [[August]], [[2012]]. [[The]] page count was expanded, the format changed to a [[perfect-bound]] magazine, and color was added to all of the pages, the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all [[concepts]] Brock had [[predicted]] would be needed to continue the magazine).

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation [[1982]] SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid [[belt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

[[Hops]] [[Infusion]] is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA [[style]]. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for [[aging]] bourbon.

These [[four]] styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

In the summer of 2009, an auxiliary scoreboard was constructed in the south end zone, [[giving]] Stambaugh Stadium a scoreboard in each end zone.

"Ishpatina Ridge is the [[highest]] point of [[land]] in the [[Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]], at an estimated [[693]] m (2,[[274]] ft) above sea [[level]].

Due to its remote location, [[Ishpatina]] Ridge is a challenge to reach. The [[closest]] [[major]] highway, [[Highway]] [[560]], is more than 30 [[km]] north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the [[remote]] area, but they are difficult to travel in [[poor]] [[weather]]. The most [[popular]] [[approach]] route to [[Ishpatina]] is by canoe/portage via a [[logging]] road to the south out of the [[town]] of [[Capreol]] north of [[Sudbury]]. While a northern [[route]] exists (out of [[Gowganda]], the nearest [[community]]), there are numerous [[portages]] [[making]] it particularly onerous.

"[[Steven]] [[Lynn]] \""[[Steve]]\"" [[Beshear]] ([[born]] [[September]] [[21]], 1944) is an [[American]] attorney and [[Democratic]] [[Party]] politician who was the [[61st]] Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015. He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the [[49th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor from 1983 to 1987. [[After]] graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear [[briefly]] practiced law in [[New]] York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a [[consumer]] [[advocate]]. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney [[general]], serving under [[Governor]] John Y. [[Brown]], Jr. As attorney [[general]], Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with [[first]] lady [[Phyllis]] George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated [[governor's]] mansion. In [[1983]], Beshear was elected [[lieutenant]] [[governor]] in the administration of [[Governor]] [[Martha]] [[Layne]] Collins. [[His]] most [[significant]] [[action]] in this capacity was the [[formation]] of the [[Kentucky]] Tomorrow [[Commission]], a [[panel]] charged with [[making]] recommendations for the future of the [[state]]. [[Beshear's]] initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. [[The]] Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor [[Brown]], the second-place finisher in the [[primary]], opened the door for political novice [[Wallace]] [[Wilkinson's]] [[well-financed]] campaign to achieve a [[come-from-behind]] upset in the race. [[For]] the [[next]] 20 [[years]], Beshear [[practiced]] law at a [[Lexington]] law [[firm]]. [[His]] only foray into [[politics]] during this period was an [[unsuccessful]] challenge to [[Senator]] Mitch [[McConnell]] in 1996. In 2007, [[however]], [[Beshear]] was [[drawn]] back into [[politics]] by the vulnerability of [[incumbent]] Republican [[Governor]] Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by [[then-Attorney]] General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the [[state's]] merit system. In the [[2007]] gubernatorial [[election]], Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary ‚Äì largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social [[programs]] like [[education]] ‚Äì and defeated Fletcher in the [[general]] election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, [[defeating]] Republican [[David]] L. Williams and [[Independent]] Gatewood Galbraith.

He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream.

Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"Geastrum [[quadrifidum]], [[commonly]] [[known]] as the rayed earthstar or [[four-footed]] earthstar, is an inedible species of [[mushroom]] [[belonging]] to the [[genus]] Geastrum, or [[earthstar]] [[fungi]]. [[First]] [[described]] scientifically by Christian Hendrik [[Persoon]] in [[1794]], G. quadrifidum is a cosmopolitan‚Äîbut not [[common]]‚Äî[[species]] of [[Europe]], the [[Americas]], Africa, Asia, and Australasia. The fungus is a saprobe, [[feeding]] off decomposing [[organic]] [[matter]] [[present]] in the [[soil]] and [[litter]] of coniferous [[forests]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

In the year of 2006, it was [[considered]] the biggest [[pride]] [[parade]] of the [[world]] by the Guinness [[Book]] of World [[Records]]. In [[2010]], the city [[hall]] of S√£o Paulo [[invested]] R$ 1 [[million]] reais in the parade. [[The]] event is the second [[largest]] of the city, after only Formula One. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the [[city]] was elected the best of the [[world]].

It follows Rua da Consola√ß√£o to the end at Pra√ßa Roosevelt, in Downtown S√£o Paulo, at around 10 PM. Strongly supported by the State and the City of S√£o Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan.

"Turkey, [[whose]] relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar [[Assad's]] father Hafez [[al-Assad]] expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad [[al-Asaad]]. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in May 2012, some Syrian opposition fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation. Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the Tomb of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoƒüan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.","Turkey, [[wose]] relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office.

Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad [[alAsaad]]. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in May 2012, some Syrian opposition fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation. Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the Tomb of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoƒüan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",0.022047221660614014,0.9958908557891846,5,0,5,321,"Successful"

"[[Frederick]] [[Charles]] '[[Fred']] [[Keenor]] ([[31]] July 1894 ‚Äì [[November]] 1972) was a [[Welsh]] professional footballer and [[Wales]] [[international]]. He [[began]] his career at his hometown [[club]] Cardiff [[City]] after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his [[former]] schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the [[Southern]] Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[First]] World War, during which Keenor served in the [[17th]] ([[Service]]) [[Battalion]], Middlesex [[Regiment]], which became known as the Football Battalion, [[led]] by [[Major]] Frank Buckley. [[During]] the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his [[thigh]] in [[1916]]. After lengthy [[rehabilitation]], he returned to [[Britain]] and [[ended]] the war as a [[fitness]] instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the [[possibility]] of playing football again [[following]] his [[shrapnel]] [[wound]], Keenor [[returned]] to [[football]] with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the [[First]] Division one [[season]] after [[joining]] the Football League in [[1920]] and [[helping]] the club to an FA Cup [[final]] in 1925, [[suffering]] a [[1]]‚Äì0 defeat to [[Sheffield]] [[United]]. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy [[Blair]] as [[club]] captain, leading the [[team]] to success in the [[1927]] FA Cup Final later in the season, where they [[defeated]] Arsenal [[1]]‚Äì[[0]]. To date, this is the only [[time]] the competition has been won by a [[team]] based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing [[squad]] had [[entered]] a [[decline]] that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the [[1930]]‚Äì31 season, when he was released. During his [[time]] at Ninian [[Park]], he [[made]] over 500 appearances for the [[club]], [[winning]] four [[Welsh]] Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs [[all-time]] [[greats]].

"[[Sir]] Matthew [[Hale]] SL (1 [[November]] 1609 ‚Äì [[25]] December 1676) was an [[influential]] [[English]] [[barrister]], [[judge]] and [[lawyer]] most [[noted]] for his [[treatise]] [[Historia]] Placitorum [[Coron√¶]], or [[The]] History of the [[Pleas]] of the [[Crown]]. [[Born]] to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was [[5]], Hale was [[raised]] by his [[father's]] [[relative]], a [[strict]] Puritan, and [[inherited]] his [[faith]]. In [[1626]] he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to [[become]] a [[priest]], but after a [[series]] of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father [[thanks]] to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a [[dispute]] over his [[estate]]. On [[8]] November [[1628]] he [[joined]] [[Lincoln's]] [[Inn]], where he was [[called]] to the [[Bar]] on 17 May [[1636]]. [[As]] a [[barrister]], Hale [[represented]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and [[William]] [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that [[Hale]] was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] used. [[Despite]] the Royalist loss, [[Hale's]] reputation for integrity and his political neutrality [[saved]] him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of [[England]] he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which [[investigated]] [[law]] [[reform]]. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] [[Pleas]]. [[As]] a [[judge]], Hale was noted for his [[resistance]] to [[bribery]] and his [[willingness]] to [[make]] politically unpopular decisions which [[upheld]] the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in [[every]] Parliament from the [[First]] [[Protectorate]] Parliament to the [[Convention]] Parliament, and [[following]] the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider [[Charles]] [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the [[English]] Restoration. [[Under]] [[Charles]], Hale was made [[first]] Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King's]] [[Bench]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly [[innovative]] judge. [[Following]] a bout of illness he [[retired]] on 20 February 1676, dying ten months [[later]] on 25 [[December]] 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common [[Law]] is noted as the first published history of English [[law]] and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","[[Si‚≤Ö]] Matthew [[Hlae]] SL (1 [[Novembe‚≤Ö]] 1609 ‚Äì [[2∆º]] December 1676) was an [[i’∏fluential]] [[Engli—ïh]] [[barriste‚≤Ö]], [[ju‘Åge]] and [[lawye‚≤Ö]] most [[note‘Å]] for his [[treati—ïe]] [[Histo‚≤Öia]] Placitorum [[Co]] [[ron√¶]], or [[Te]] History of the [[Peas]] of the [[Cro‘ùn]].

Born in Blackstock, [[Ontario]] [[near]] [[Port]] [[Perry]], [[Bruce]] was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. He [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in [[Toronto]] which he founded in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of [[surgery]] at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during [[World]] War I, he was appointed [[inspector-general]] of the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]] by [[Sir]] Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the [[Canadian]] Army (Permanent Active [[Militia]]). [[Bruce]] [[investigated]] [[medical]] practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian [[Army]] Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the [[medical]] [[corps]]. Few of his recommendations for [[general]] reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by [[Sir]] William [[Osler]] as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's [[report]] was disowned by the government at the [[time]] and he was dismissed from his [[duties]], while his conservative patron, [[Hughes]], was obliged to resign. In [[1919]], [[Bruce]] [[published]] Politics and the Canadian Army [[Medical]] [[Corps]], criticizing the [[government]] for its actions but [[avoiding]] any [[specific]] denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the [[war]], as [[surgical]] [[consultant]] to the [[British]] [[forces]], [[Bruce]] was able to advance some [[useful]] reforms in [[surgical]] management, [[including]] greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating [[room]] technicians. In [[1920]], [[Bruce]] purchased a [[farm]] on Bayview [[Avenue]] overlooking the Don [[Valley]] and [[built]] a Tudor-style mansion which he [[named]] [[Annandale]]. In [[1932]], he was appointed [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He [[often]] [[verbally]] [[clashed]] with new [[Ontario]] [[Premier]] Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the [[extravagance]] of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great [[Depression]]. The [[lieutenant-governor's]] official residence, [[Chorley]] [[Park]], was closed by the Hepburn government at the [[end]] of [[Bruce's]] term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are [[former]] [[politicians]], [[Bruce]] [[took]] the unusual [[step]] of entering politics [[following]] his [[term]] as the King's [[representative]]. [[Following]] the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce [[contested]] and won [[Spence's]] seat in the [[Canadian]] House of Commons in the 1940 [[federal]] election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His [[autobiography]],  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. His mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. [[Due]] to [[ill-treatment]] by his stepmother, Demetrius [[left]] home and [[went]] to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a [[barber]]. He [[converted]] to Islam and took the [[name]] [[Mehmet]], but later repented and [[became]] an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the [[weight]] of his sin fully weighed in and [[decided]] that to expiate his mistake, he [[must]] [[perform]] a [[great]] penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. [[His]] [[abbot]] tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a [[nearby]] leader and told them he had apostatized, which [[got]] him detained.

In 1853 he [[married]] Ann [[Martindale]], with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer.

In [[1883]] Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the [[federal]] [[convention]]. In 1886 he [[quit]] politics and on [[1]] January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. [[The]] appointment was not [[without]] controversy as [[several]] [[barristers]] had served longer in the legal [[profession]], but Kerferd did have eight years as [[attorney-general]].

In [[September]] 1948 the family moved to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. As a child he was known as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his name \""[[Athanasios]]\"", but when he started university he adopted the name \""John\"". Traicos [[grew]] up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the [[time]] was regarded as a \""province\"" within the [[South]] [[African]] [[domestic]] [[cricket]] setup. While a [[student]] at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard making his first-class debut on 24 June 1967 when he represented South African [[Universities]] against Cambridge University, taking 5‚Äì[[54]] in the [[first]] [[innings]]. He [[represented]] the South [[African]] Universities [[team]] on two more [[occasions]] before making his [[Rhodesia]] debut on 27 January 1968.

He [[took]] [[four]] catches and [[three]] [[wickets]] in his debut Test. [[However]], after his [[three]] [[appearances]] in this series, [[South]] Africa were [[banned]] from [[international]] cricket because of [[apartheid]]. [[Traicos]] [[continued]] to [[play]] for [[Rhodesia]], and after the country was [[renamed]] in [[1980]] represented [[Zimbabwe]] in the 1982, [[1986]] and [[1990]] [[ICC]] Trophy tournaments. He [[also]] played for Zimbabwe in the [[1983]] [[Cricket]] [[World]] [[Cup]], and was an [[important]] part of the side which [[inflicted]] a shock [[defeat]] on [[Australia]]. Zimbabwe were raised to [[Test]] [[status]] in [[1992]], and Traicos was [[selected]] for the country's [[inaugural]] [[Test]] match, at Harare Sports Club against [[India]]. This [[appearance]] [[came]] a record [[22]] years and [[222]] days after his previous Test appearance, and he repaid the selectors' decision with his best Test [[bowling]] figures of 5/[[86]]. He played three more Tests for Zimbabwe, and his final appearance came at the age of 45 years and [[304]] days, making him the oldest [[Test]] player since Miran Bux [[38]] years earlier, and the twelfth oldest of all time. He would have been even further up the list had he been [[available]] for selection for the following year's tour of Pakistan, but Traicos' business commitments prevented this.

"[[The]] [[Usoi]] Dam is a natural [[landslide]] dam along the Murghab [[River]] in Tajikistan.

"WCWS-FM is the radio [[station]] of The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio, [[USA]]. [[It]] is also [[known]] as WOO 91, Wooster's [[Sound]] [[Alternative]]. WCWS [[broadcasts]] 1050 watts of power at a frequency of [[90]].[[9]] MHz to Wayne and neighboring counties. [[Under]] the FCC Table of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, WNZR, also operates at [[90]].[[9]] MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential. Students [[share]] the administrative [[duties]] of running the station with a faculty adviser, currently John Finn, to oversee them. Herman Gibbs is the chief operator/[[engineer]] of WCWS, and has [[served]] in that role since [[1984]]. Radio at the College of Wooster began back in the 1950s broadcasting music and local programs as well as campus [[activities]] in mono to the greater Wooster [[community]]. The [[1980s]] saw the addition of a satellite dish to broadcast Metropolitan Opera programs on Saturday afternoons. During the school year 1984/85 WCWS went stereo for the first time under the leadership of Gibbs as well as student managers Dan Garan and Kenyon Mau. Further changes came in latter years, including the frequency change from 91.9 to 90.9 FM. For the full history of WCWS, please [[see]] [[WOO]] 91 [[Station]] History. In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian radio group, challenged WCWS and other radio [[stations]] during the FCC [[licence]] [[renewal]] [[process]]. [[Due]] to the [[efforts]] of the College of [[Wooster]] [[administration]], [[Herman]] Gibbs, John [[Finn]], and the [[student]] [[management]], the FCC [[denied]] the [[challenge]] in May 2005. During the fight for their station, a [[new]] station identity, WOO 91, was created, and a new logo was designed to fit the new image.

"Belfast Central Library is a public library in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster. Two additional buildings were added to the site in the 1960s and 1980s, providing staff accommodation and extra storage. These reflect the growth in the book stock of the library in the intervening decades. A newspaper library is situated in the 1980s building and accessed from Library Street.
