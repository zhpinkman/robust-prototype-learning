"[[On]] 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football [[Club]] in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions.

Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions.

The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg.

The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

"George Elliott Hagan (May 24, 1916 – December 26, 1990) was an American politician, businessman and farmer and a Democrat.

Hagan served in numerous other [[state]] government [[positions]] and also worked in the [[insurance]] and [[financial]] [[planning]] industry and several agricultural pursuits.

"Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin (born 10 [[January]] 1952 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian [[chess]] grandmaster and former European [[junior]] champion. [[Many]] [[honours]] and [[awards]] were [[bestowed]] on him as a young [[man]]. [[After]] [[winning]] the European [[Junior]] [[Championship]] in 1973, he [[became]] an [[International]] [[Master]] the same [[year]]. In 1974 he was a [[member]] of the victorious [[USSR]] [[team]] at the World [[Student]] [[Team]] [[Championship]] [[held]] in Teesside, [[England]], where he [[scored]] the [[best]] [[result]] for board 4 (8/9). The [[following]] [[year]], he [[had]] a [[terrific]] [[result]] at the [[USSR]] [[Championship]], sharing [[second]] [[place]] with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and [[Rafael]] Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster [[title]] was [[ratified]]. [[He]] [[has]] an impressive collection of tournament victories [[including]] Odessa 1974, Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan 1976, [[Hastings]] 1976/77, [[Leningrad]] 1977 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 ([[shared]] with Tal), Jurmala 1983, [[Moscow]] 1985, [[Reggio]] [[Emilia]] 1986 (shared with [[Andersson]] and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian [[Open]] [[Championship]] at Györ in 1990 he [[enjoyed]] a most impressive [[victory]], [[finishing]] a clear 2 [[points]] ahead of the [[field]]. Second place [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and [[Dortmund]] 1982 (after Hort) were also [[important]] landmarks in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= [[finish]] at Sochi in 1982. [[Nowadays]] [[less]] [[active]] as a [[tournament]] [[player]], he [[has]] nevertheless [[maintained]] a [[highly]] competitive [[rating]] and is [[able]] to [[win]] [[smaller]] [[events]] on the grandmaster [[circuit]], such as Solin-Split 2004 and [[Hotel]] [[Petra]] ([[Rome]]) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he [[represented]] the [[Soviet]] [[Union]] in 1978 and thereafter [[played]] for [[Ukraine]] through the 1990s, winning a [[total]] of 2 silver [[medals]] and 2 bronze. [[At]] the European Team [[Chess]] [[Championships]] his [[medal]] [[haul]] [[has]] [[amounted]] to an [[incredible]] 6 gold and 1 [[silver]]. His chess [[playing]] [[style]] [[has]] been described as aggressive and this may [[be]] a [[result]] of the [[coaching]] he [[received]] as a [[junior]]. Along with a group of other [[aspiring]] masters, he was first coached by [[Viktor]] [[Kart]] (an instructor of the Lviv [[Sports]] [[Academy]]) and then, as an improver, was [[assigned]] a [[senior]] [[master]] as a [[tutor]]/[[mentor]]. [[In]] his [[case]] the [[master]] was [[Mikhail]] Tal, an ex-world [[champion]] [[noted]] for his [[attacking]] chess. [[In]] [[respect]] of [[chess]] [[opening]] [[theory]], he [[has]] a [[reputation]] for the [[use]] of [[rare]], offbeat and sometimes, long since [[discarded]] [[systems]].

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketballs]] League.

"Canaiolo (also called Canaiolo nero or Uva Canina) is a red Italian wine [[grape]] grown through Central Italy but is most noted in Tuscany. Other regions with plantings of Canaiolo include Lazio, Marche and Sardegna. In Umbria a white berried mutation known as Canaiolo bianco exist. Together with Sangiovese and Colorino it is often used to create Chianti wine and is an important but secondary component of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. In the history of Chianti it has been a key component blend and during the 18th century may have been the primarily grape used in higher percentage than Sangiovese. Part of its popularity may have been the grape's ability to partially dry out without rotting for use in the governo method of prolonging fermentation. In the 19th century, the Chianti recipe of Bettino Ricasoli called for Canaiolo to play a supporting role to Sangiovese, adding fruitiness and softening tannins without detracting from the wine's aromas. In the aftermath of the phylloxera epidemic, the Canaiolo vines did not take well to grafting onto new American rootstock and the grape began to steadily fall out of favor. As of 2006, total plantings of Canaiolo throughout Italy dropped to under 7,410 acres (3,000 hectares).

The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena.

The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that entered the East Coast Hockey League for the 1999–2000 season. Their home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team.

"Ishpatina Ridge is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the Canadian [[province]] of [[Ontario]], at an [[estimated]] 693 [[m]] (2,274 [[ft]]) above [[sea]] [[level]]. Ishpatina Ridge [[rises]] [[approximately]] 300 [[m]] (984 [[ft]]) above the [[immediate]] [[area]]. [[It]] was only [[truly]] [[recognized]] as Ontario's highest [[point]] after [[federal]] [[government]] topographical [[mapping]] [[revealed]] this fact in the 1970s. [[Before]] then, the more [[popular]] Maple [[Mountain]] was [[thought]] to [[be]] [[higher]]. The [[ridge]] [[lies]] in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Due to its remote location, Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest [[major]] [[highway]], [[Highway]] 560, is more than 30 [[km]] [[north]]. There are a [[few]] logging roads and [[trails]] in the [[remote]] [[area]], but they are [[difficult]] to [[travel]] in [[poor]] [[weather]]. The most [[popular]] [[approach]] [[route]] to Ishpatina is by [[canoe]]/portage [[via]] a logging [[road]] to the [[south]] out of the [[town]] of Capreol [[north]] of [[Sudbury]]. [[While]] a [[northern]] [[route]] [[exists]] (out of Gowganda, the [[nearest]] [[community]]), there are [[numerous]] portages making it [[particularly]] onerous. [[This]] [[route]] [[has]] [[traditionally]] been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by ski/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a fire tower atop the ridge was [[staffed]] by forest [[workers]] and they would [[have]] been [[ferried]] to the [[site]] by float [[plane]]. The [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" [[comes]] from an Ojibwe language [[word]] ishpadinaa, meaning \""[[high]] [[place]]/ridge\"". The [[city]] of Ishpeming, [[Michigan]], in Marquette [[County]], and Spadina [[Avenue]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] [[derive]] their [[names]] from the same [[word]]. [[Although]] the Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the [[highest]] [[point]] in [[Ontario]], at least one other [[geographic]] [[feature]], [[Maple]] [[Mountain]] ([[approximately]] 25 [[km]] to the [[east]]) [[has]] [[greater]] [[prominence]], 37 [[m]] (121 ft) [[higher]] than Ishpatina Ridge's [[rise]] over [[Scarecrow]] [[Lake]]. An [[abandoned]] firetower, [[often]] [[referred]] to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is [[still]] [[standing]] on the [[highest]] section of the [[Ridge]] (left). The [[original]] [[tower]] was an 80 [[ft]] [[structure]] [[erected]] in 1930. The successor, [[currently]] [[standing]], is 100 ft [[high]] and was [[abandoned]] in the 1960s. The towerman would [[have]] [[resided]] in a [[cabin]] on the [[shore]] of Scarecrow [[Lake]] and would [[have]] [[hiked]] a 3.5 [[km]] [[trail]] daily [[taking]] [[approximately]] [[two]] [[hours]] to [[summit]] and a [[little]] over one hour to [[descend]] again. Located between [[Tower]] [[Peak]] and the North [[Peak]], the Ishpatina [[Canyon]] is one of the [[deepest]] in Ontario.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar.

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.
