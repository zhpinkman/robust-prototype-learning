"New York State Route 373 (NY 373) is a short state [[highway]] in [[Essex]] County, [[New]] [[York]], within Adirondack State [[Park]]. It begins at U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and proceeds eastward, ending at a ferry landing on Lake Champlain. [[It]] intersects [[two]] county routes, several local [[roads]], and a reference route—NY 912T—which connects it with US 9. NY 373 is the only connector between [[US]] 9 and the hamlet of Port Kent and the ferry that serves it. The hamlet of [[Port]] Kent and the connecting road were originally built in [[1823]]. The village was planned to act as a source of labor for [[iron]] manufacturing and to [[provide]] for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton [[Turnpike]] in the 1830s.

"On 20 October 1990, Manchester [[United]] Football Club faced Arsenal [[Football]] Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"[[The]] Raid on Griessie was a British attack on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East [[Indies]] in December 1807 during the Napoleonic [[Wars]]. [[The]] raid was the final action in a series of engagements fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Sir]] Edward Pellew—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia [[raid]] however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to [[sail]] eastwards, where they [[took]] shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and [[agreed]] to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour.

"[[Russells]] Hall Hospital is an [[NHS]] general hospital located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, [[run]] by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. [[The]] hospital is situated [[south-west]] of the town centre on the [[A4101]] road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. [[It]] was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the [[general]] hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The [[new]] hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for [[Russells]] Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close [[Wordsley]] and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as [[parts]] of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen [[Wordsley]] Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to [[Russells]] Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to out-patient services only, with [[Russells]] Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the [[expansion]] was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the [[revamped]] hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual [[carriageway]] in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999.

"\""Space Invaders\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979.

The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia.

"Balaji Baji [[Rao]] (8 December 1720 – 23 June 1761), also known as Nana Saheb, was a Peshwa ([[prime]] [[minister]]) of the Maratha [[Empire]] in India. [[During]] his [[tenure]], the Chhatrapati ([[Maratha]] king) was [[reduced]] to a mere figurehead. At the same time, the [[Maratha]] [[empire]] [[started]] transforming into a confederacy, in which individual chiefs — such as the Holkars, the Scindias and the Bhonsles of Nagpur — became more powerful. During Balaji Rao's tenure, the Maratha territory reached its zenith. A large part of this [[expansion]], [[however]], was led by the [[individual]] chiefs, whose [[acts]] of plundering alienated the masses. By the [[end]] of Balaji Rao's tenure, the Peshwa was [[reduced]] to more of a financier than a [[general]].

"Northampton /[[nɔːˈθæmptən]]/ is the [[county]] [[town]] of [[Northamptonshire]] in the East Midlands of England. [[It]] lies on the River Nene, about 67 miles (108 km) north-west of London and 50 miles (80 km) south-east of Birmingham. One of the largest towns in the UK, Northampton had a population of 212,100 in the 2011 census. [[Archaeological]] evidence of settlement in the area [[dates]] back to the Bronze Age, [[Roman]] and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the [[town]] rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton [[Castle]], which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by King Richard I in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by King John in [[1215]]. The town is also the [[site]] of [[two]] medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection [[languished]] in the modern period; the [[town]] supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil [[War]], which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[town]] also suffered the Great Fire of Northampton (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union [[Canal]] and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for [[footwear]] and leather manufacture. After the World Wars, [[Northampton's]] growth was limited until it was designated as a New [[Town]] in [[1968]], accelerating development in the [[town]].

[[Iat]] lies on the River Nene, about 67 miles (108 km) north-west of London and 50 miles (80 km) south-east of Birmingham. One of the largest towns in the UK, Northampton had a population of 212,100 in the 2011 census. [[ArSchaeological]] evidence of settlement in the area [[dats]] back to the Bronze Age, [[oRman]] and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the [[towMn]] rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton [[Castile]], which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted its first town charter by King Richard I in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by King John in [[121]]. The town is also the [[kite]] of [[tow]] medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection [[languised]] in the modern period; the [[tow]] supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil [[Wr]], which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[twon]] also suffered the Great Fire of Northampton (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union [[Cqanal]] and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for [[footwar]] and leather manufacture. After the World Wars, [[Northampston's]] growth was limited until it was designated as a New [[Towqn]] in [[168]], accelerating development in the [[tow]].

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Mogyoród took [[place]] on [[14]] March [[1074]]. [[It]] was an internal [[conflict]] between Solomon, King of Hungary and his cousins duke Géza and Ladislaus, who were claiming rights to the throne. Solomon ruled for a few years, during which he [[allegedly]] submitted the country to the Holy Roman Empire as a vassal state to ensure his power over the kingdom at [[fear]] of his relatives usurping the throne. After a series of campaigns directed against the Byzantine Empire, which were led by Duke Géza and Ladislaus, Solomon grew bitter and felt unappreciated because of their success on the field.

[[Formed]] in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"William [[Harold]] Lee ([[December]] 9, 1884 – February 3, [[1971]]) was an American [[20th]] century movie theater [[designer]] and later the [[chief]] architect for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in [[Shamokin]], Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn [[Mawr]] Theatre in Bryn [[Mawr]], Pennsylvania, the [[Hiway]] [[Theatre]] in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in [[Vineland]], New Jersey. [[In]] 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. [[The]] Royal Theatre at [[1524]] South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles.

He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in [[Shamozin]], Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn [[aMwr]] Theatre in Bryn [[MaPr]], Pennsylvania, the [[iway]] [[Theater]] in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in [[Vieland]], New Jersey. [[nI]] 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. [[Te]] Royal Theatre at [[1254]] South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles.

"The black-lored babbler or [[Sharpe's]] pied-babbler ([[Turdoides]] [[sharpei]]) is a [[species]] of bird in the [[Leiothrichidae]] [[family]]. It is [[found]] in southwestern Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and the part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo immediately adjacent to the three last-named countries. This bird was formerly considered the same species as Turdoides melanops of southern Africa, now known as the black-faced [[babbler]]. These birds are mostly grey-brown with white mottling, especially on the underparts, that varies according to location and the individual. The population near Nanyuki, Kenya, is darker but can have a pure white chin or entire throat. The combination of pale yellow or white eyes and black lores (the areas between the eye and the bill) separates adults of this species from similar babblers except melanops, though all juvenile babblers have brown eyes. In Kenya, single birds give [[repeated]] single or double [[harsh]] [[notes]] such as [[waaach]] or a muffled kurr-ack; pairs or groups give longer phrases in chorus. The tempo is frequently [[slow]] for a [[babbler]]. They are most vocal in the early morning and late afternoon. Like other [[Turdoides]], it is [[found]] low or on the ground in or near dense woody vegetation, including in cultivated areas. Kenyan birds forage in bushes and tall grass.

"AIA [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as AIA (Chinese: [[友邦保險控股有限公司]]) is the [[largest]] [[independent]] [[public]] [[listed]] [[pan-Asian]] life insurance group. [[It]] has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New [[York-based]] American International Group (AIG). In [[2009]] AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, [[announced]] that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, [[raising]] approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the [[world's]] third largest IPO ever. [[In]] September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% [[stake]] in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri [[Lanka's]] National Development Bank (NDB).

[[t]] has a presence in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% subsidiary in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an insurance agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New [[York-baued]] American International Group (AIG). In [[209]] AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, [[Bnnounced]] that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, [[gaising]] approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the [[worl'ds]] third largest IPO ever.

"George Elliott [[Hagan]] ([[May]] [[24]], 1916 – December 26, 1990) was an American [[politician]], businessman and farmer and a Democrat. Hagan was born in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the University of Georgia in Athens. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1939 to 1944, resigned from office to join the United States Army as a member of the Signal Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted [[segregationist]] in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to 33,[[629]]), but under Georgia's election laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to [[win]] unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872).

In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael [[Vaganian]], after [[Tigran]] Petrosian. In [[1976]], his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990.

Leading from the northern end of Lambton Quay, central Wellington's main street, it is a northbound one-way street linking the CBD with Tinakori Road, and through it, with main routes north out of the city. The street was named for Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet, a prominent member of the New Zealand Company. There is another Molesworth Street in the Wellington metropolitan area, located in the Lower [[Hutt]] suburb of [[Taita]]. Many of New Zealand's main governmental and archival institutions are located on Molesworth Street, most notably New Zealand Parliament Buildings, which are located at the [[street's]] southern end.

"The Milwaukee Does were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game.

"3043 [[San]] [[Diego]], provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American [[female]] astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September [[1982]], at the U.S. [[Palomar]] [[Observatory]] in California. [[The]] bright [[E-type]] asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of [[22]]° with respect to the ecliptic. The [[first]] observation was taken at Crimea–[[Nauchnij]] in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a [[re-examined]] [[light-curve]] that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. [[According]] to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid [[Lightcurve]] Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of [[13]].7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city [[council's]] efforts to reduce the local light pollution ([[see]] [[dark-sky]] movement). [[Palomar]] mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city [[would]] ruin their ability to [[use]] the [[observatory]]. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 [[Sna]] [[xDiego]], provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[ateroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of [[2]]° with respect to the ecliptic. The [[fqirst]] observation was taken at Crimea–[[Nauchdnij]] in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a [[pe-examined]] [[ligh-tcurve]] that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. [[Accordig]] to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid [[LiHhtcurve]] Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of [[31]].7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city [[counGil's]] efforts to reduce the local light pollution ([[se]] [[dtrk-sky]] movement). [[Palomr]] mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city [[qwould]] ruin their ability to [[ues]] the [[observratory]]. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).",0.048953890800476074,0.05449718236923218,2,2,2,430,"Failed"

This [[xide]] features two trains, but only operates with one. [[Eact]] train consists of 3 cars that have 2 rows each [[bar]]. Each row is 1 longs seat, so it is possible to squeeze 3 small people into the seat. It is widely known to the coaster [[xenthusiasts]] because of its lack of restraints. It is located next to the Carousel and Flying Aces. While the Rollo Coaster features only small hills, it uses topography to its advantage. Built over [[stee]] [[terran]], the ride features [[maCny]] tight twists and turns which create a rough ride and a sense of much greater speed.

Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were [[poanted]] on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed [[rewers]] of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the [[brewuery]] had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale [[hmarvest]] equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 [[miKlion]] in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011.

"The River Witham is a river [[almost]] [[entirely]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]] in the east of England. It rises south of Grantham close to South Witham at [[SK8818]], passes Lincoln at [[SK9771]] and at Boston, [[TF3244]], flows into The Haven, a tidal arm of The Wash, near RSPB Frampton Marsh.

"The Darshan Museum is a museum in Pune, India, [[dedicated]] to the noted [[Sindhi]] [[Saint]] and [[scholar]], [[Sadhu]] T. L. [[Vaswani]]. It is a biographical museum that offers an insight into the life and therefore the teachings of [[Sadhu]] [[Vaswani]]. The [[museum]] is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the [[Sadhu]] [[Vaswani]] Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, [[educative]] and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings – in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This [[museum]] has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life [[mannequins]], graphic panels, [[holographic]] screens, interactive, [[audio-visual]] material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written format. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011. At the function he went on to felicitate the people who contributed majorly to the project and held a candid question and answer session with revered J. P. Vaswani. The Sadhu Vaswani Mission is a [[charitable]] organisation [[based]] in Pune with branches all over the world. Originally known as the 'The Brotherhood Association' it was renamed to Sadhu Vaswani Mission upon the demise of its founder and spiritual head, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani.

"The George P. Coleman [[Memorial]] [[Bridge]] (known [[locally]] as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double [[swing]] bridge that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. The bridge is the only public crossing of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) at just above its source at West Point. Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current 3,750-foot (1,140 m)-long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial [[highway]]. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy's Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost 90 feet (27 m) above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world. The toll bridge was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to 1922 was the head of the Virginia [[Department]] of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT).

Coleman [[Memqorial]] [[mridge]] (known [[ocally]] as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double [[wing]] bridge that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. The bridge is the only public crossing of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) at just above its source at West Point. Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current 3,750-foot (1,140 m)-long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial [[highay]]. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy's Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost 90 feet (27 m) above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world. The toll bridge was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to 1922 was the head of the Virginia [[Dpartment]] of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT).

"90377 Sedna is a [[large]] [[minor]] [[planet]] in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about [[86]] [[astronomical]] units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune.

"Martin Bruce Cameron ([[born]] 24 August 1936), Australian [[politician]], was a [[member]] of the Australian Senate and the South [[Australian]] Legislative [[Council]]. [[In]] [[1968]] Cameron [[contested]] the safe [[Labor]] House of Assembly [[seat]] of [[Millicent]] for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des [[Corcoran]] on road [[transport]] control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but [[lost]] by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered a [[by-election]]. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces [[within]] the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL Legislative Councillors, due to his support for Universal Suffrage for that chamber. This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally [[functioned]] as a faction within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the LCL (led at this stage by Bruce [[Eastick]]) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement members, such as future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown, decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron left with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 Election when he was joined by John Carnie. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the LCL (renamed the Liberal Party of Australia in 1974), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification. [[In]] 1976 Cameron and Hall rejoined the Liberal Party, while Millhouse initially formed the New LM before helping found the Australian Democrats.

Following his [[retirement]] from the Council, Cameron served a term as president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party. Later, he became a vocal supporter of the 'yes' case in the 1999 republic referendum.","Martin Bruce Cameron ([[bowrn]] 24 August 1936), Australian [[politicwan]], was a [[membet]] of the Australian Senate and the South [[Astralian]] Legislative [[Cuouncil]]. [[n]] [[f968]] Cameron [[contxsted]] the safe [[YLabor]] House of Assembly [[seft]] of [[Milklicent]] for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des [[Crocoran]] on road [[transRort]] control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but [[Most]] by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered a [[yb-election]]. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces [[wihtin]] the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL Legislative Councillors, due to his support for Universal Suffrage for that chamber. This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally [[fnuctioned]] as a faction within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the LCL (led at this stage by Bruce [[Easnick]]) expelled the Liberal Movement.

"Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. Its [[members]] are commonly known as the [[sac]] [[fungi]] or ascomycetes. [[They]] are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""[[ascus]]\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile [[spores]], called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form [[asci]] or ascospores. Previously [[placed]] in the Deuteromycota along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or [[anamorphic]]) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants.

The fungal [[symbionts]] in the majority of [[lichens]] (loosely termed \""[[ascolichens]]\"") such as [[Cladonia]] belong to the [[Ascomycota]]. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, [[rice]] blast, the [[ergot]] fungi, [[black]] knot, and the powdery [[mildews]]. Several species of [[ascomycetes]] are biological model organisms in [[laboratory]] [[research]]. Most famously, [[Neurospora]] crassa, several species of yeasts, and [[Aspergillus]] species are used in [[many]] genetics and cell biology studies.

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the highest point of land in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated 693 m (2,274 ft) above sea level.

Due to its remote location, Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote [[area]], but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. [[This]] route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe.

After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He [[parlayed]] that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y.

In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. [[Beshear's]] initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a [[five-candidate]] Democratic gubernatorial primary election.

In the 2007 gubernatorial election, [[Beshear]] emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his [[pledge]] to expand casino gambling as a [[means]] of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.

The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s.

"[[Koi]] wa Ina Mono [[Myōna]] Mono or also known as Koiha Ina Mono [[Mouna]] Mono ([[恋は異なもの妙なもの]], trans. Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional manga [[written]] and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Zaō (also known for her shōjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in [[2002]]. [[The]] [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation. This series was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Dear+ in 2002.

[[The]] exact reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after firing at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over.

Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as [[MaRry]] Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but 35–40 of her crew. [[Tne]] exact reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after firing at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the [[Forench]] fleet believed that the [[galeys]] had sunk her, though this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains. The [[Frenh]] [[roops]] ashore made no progress and returned to France in August.",0.05069214105606079,0.06103312969207764,5,5,5,609,"Failed"

"[[The]] Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] ([[also]] known as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

[[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between [[Hoboken]], New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake [[Hopatcong]] in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling [[gradient]] (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 [[July]] [[1894]] – [[November]] 1972) was a Welsh professional footballer and [[Wales]] international. [[He]] began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World [[War]], during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, [[led]] by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, [[Keenor]] returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division [[one]] season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an [[FA]] Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. [[In]] 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the [[Cardiff]] City Stadium, in November [[2012]] following a public fundraising campaign.

"Sir Matthew [[Hale]] SL (1 November [[1609]] – 25 December 1676) was an influential [[English]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In [[1626]] he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now [[Hertford]] College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his [[father]] thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. [[On]] 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any [[repercussions]], and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the [[Upper]] House, in [[every]] Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as [[monarch]], sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief [[Baron]] of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. [[In]] both [[positions]], he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly [[innovative]] judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying [[ten]] [[months]] later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, [[published]] after his death. His Historia Placitorum [[Coronæ]], dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is [[considered]] \""of the highest [[authority]]\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""[[appeal]] to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","Sir Matthew [[aHle]] SL (1 November [[160]] – 25 December 1676) was an influential [[nEglish]] barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.

[[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. [[In]] 1916, during World [[War]] I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated [[medical]] practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the [[medical]] profession. Bruce's [[report]] was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. [[In]] 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating [[room]] technicians. [[In]] [[1920]], Bruce [[purchased]] a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. [[In]] 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the [[end]] of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden [[death]] of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the [[1940]] federal election campaign, [[Bruce]] contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the [[1940]] federal election.

"[[The]] men's single sculls competition at the [[2000]] [[Summer]] [[Olympics]] in Sydney, Australia [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. This rowing [[event]] is a single scull [[event]], meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. [[The]] \""[[scull]]\"" [[portion]] means that the rower uses two [[oars]], one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one [[oar]] and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles [[events]]). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to [[determine]] the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better [[ranking]]. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.

"MoreArt is an [[annual]] [[art]] in public spaces [[event]] [[along]] the City of [[Moreland's]] iconic Upfield Bike Path, railway corridor and Sydney Road. The first event was held in 2010.

"[[Col]] [[de]] [[Pierre]] [[Pertuis]] (el. 827 m.) is a mountain pass in the Jura Mountains in the [[canton]] of Bern in [[Switzerland]]. [[It]] connects Sonceboz and [[Tavannes]]. The name of the pass comes from the Latin: Petra [[pertusa]], meaning broken rock. The pass [[road]] has been dated to the second half of the 1st century [[AD]]. A [[159]] by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the [[road]] lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony [[Aventicum]], as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. [[It]] probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky [[gate]] leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern [[Avenches]])-Salodurum (modern [[Solothurn]])-Augusta [[Raurica]] road with the Vesontio (modern [[Besançon]])-Epomanduodurum (modern [[Mandeure]])-Kembs road. The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant [[Reformation]]. The first modern [[road]] was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel. This road linked the cities of Basel and Biel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the pass became part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the surrounding area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Bern widened part of the pass [[road]] in a section between Bözingen (now part of Biel) and [[Courtelary]]. In 1874 a railway tunnel was completed through the pass which linked Sonceboz-Tavannes.

[[Vt]] connects Sonceboz and [[Tavanes]]. The name of the pass comes from the Latin: Petra [[pGrtusa]], meaning broken rock. The pass [[roaFd]] has been dated to the second half of the 1st century [[A]]. A [[59]] by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the [[roam]] lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony [[qAventicum]], as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. [[I]] probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky [[gaVe]] leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern [[Ahvenches]])-Salodurum (modern [[Solotuhrn]])-Augusta [[Rauirca]] road with the Vesontio (modern [[BeUançon]])-Epomanduodurum (modern [[Mandeuze]])-Kembs road. The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant [[Refoermation]]. The first modern [[rod]] was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel.

"[[Ellis]] Edgar \""[[Puss]]\"" [[Achong]] (16 February 1904 – [[29]] August 1986) was a sportsman from Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies. He played cricket for the [[West]] Indies and was the first person of known Chinese descent to [[play]] in a Test match. Left-arm [[unorthodox]] spin (left-arm wrist spin) is sometimes known as \""slow left-arm [[chinaman]]\"" ([[SLC]]) which is thought to be in his honour. [[Achong]] was born in Belmont, Port of [[Spain]]. He played football as a left-winger for a local [[team]], Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowler]]. His stock [[ball]] was left-arm [[orthodox]] spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have [[Walter]] Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins [[said]] to the umpire [[Joe]] Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". [[Learie]] Constantine is [[said]] to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""chinaman\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to [[bowl]] unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West [[Indies]] and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West [[Indies]] between 1929–30 and 1934–[[35]]. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–[[32]], he [[took]] 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He married during the 1933 tour of England and settled in Manchester. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including [[10]] in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to [[Trinidad]] and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply. Achong ultimately became a sports coach with the Trinidad and Tobago Ministry of Education, coaching and selecting the Trinidad and Tobago cricket team. He died aged 82 in St. Augustine.","[[ElPlis]] Edgar \""[[uss]]\"" [[Ahong]] (16 February 1904 – [[Z29]] August 1986) was a sportsman from Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies.

"The SM Kirov Stadium was a [[multi-purpose]] [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. [[The]] stadium was [[named]] after Sergey [[Kirov]]. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World [[War]] [[II]] and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. [[The]] stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad [[teams]], [[Zenit]] and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places).

[[Te]] poem Under the Viaduct, 1932 from the Pulitzer Prize [[winCing]] book of poems Thomas and Beulah by Rita Dove, [[neferenced]] the North [[Will]] Viaduct. Over its existence, the North Hill Viaduct had been the site of at least one suicide a year, though [[oplice]] records were not complete. At least two survived jumps in the 1930s. The replacement bridge has also been a magnet for suicides. From 1997 until December 3, 2009, [[n9]] people committed suicide by jumping from the bridge. In 2009, it was announced that $1 million to $1.5 million [[woWld]] be spent to fence the bridge using federal economic stimulus funds. Fencing the bridge was controversial in Akron and the plan had previously failed to receive local [[sapport]]. Previous local [[atsempts]] to fence the bridge failed in 1991, 1993, [[000]] and 2006. The project was expected to be [[completd]] by [[Septelmber]] 2010 but was stopped for the winter of 2010-2011. The project was finally [[compjleted]] in late December [[011]] at a total cost of around $8.7 million.

He also played for Sheffield Collegiate and Barnsley and captained the Yorkshire second team. He joined Derbyshire in the 1909 season, making his debut against Warwickshire when he was not out at the end of a drawn match. [[He]] played a full season and in his second [[match]] against Warwickshire [[made]] his top score of [[198]]. In [[1910]] he was appointed captain and, again against Warwickshire, he made 165 while putting on 283 for the ninth wicket with Arnold Warren. [[In]] [[2012]] this remained the world record for a ninth-wicket partnership in [[first-class]] cricket. Chapman was captain of Derbyshire again in 1911 and 1912. [[He]] achieved a batting [[average]] of over [[30]] in the 1911 season, but this was down to 8 in the 1912 Season.

"Athanasios [[John]] Traicos (born 17 May 1947) is a [[former]] [[cricketer]] who [[represented]] South [[Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]] at international level. He was primarily an off spin bowler, and is one of a small number of cricketers to have played at the highest level for more than one country. Traicos was born in Zagazig, Egypt in 1947 where his father Tryphon worked in the family business. He is of Greek descent, his father having been [[born]] in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal grandmother in Kalymnos, also in Greece. [[In]] September 1948 the family moved to what was then Fort Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. As a child he was known as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his name \""Athanasios\"", but when he started university he adopted the [[name]] \""John\"". Traicos grew up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" [[within]] the South African domestic cricket setup. While a student at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard making his first-class debut on [[24]] June 1967 when he represented South African Universities against Cambridge University, taking 5–54 in the first innings. He represented the South African Universities team on [[two]] more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on [[27]] January 1968. He made his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at [[Durban]] in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali Bacher. He took four catches and three [[wickets]] in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international cricket because of apartheid. Traicos continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 [[ICC]] Trophy tournaments.

Zimbabwe were raised to Test status in 1992, and Traicos was selected for the country's inaugural Test match, at Harare [[Sports]] Club against India. [[This]] appearance came a record 22 years and [[222]] days after his previous Test appearance, and he repaid the selectors' decision with his best Test bowling [[figures]] of 5/86. [[He]] played three more Tests for Zimbabwe, and his final appearance came at the age of 45 years and 304 [[days]], making him the oldest Test player since Miran Bux 38 years earlier, and the twelfth oldest of all time.

"The [[Usoi]] Dam is a natural landslide [[dam]] along the Murghab River in Tajikistan. At [[567]] metres (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or [[man-made]]. [[The]] dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.[[4-Ms]] [[Sarez]] earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply [[sloped]] river valley of the [[Murghab]], which cuts from east to west through the high and rough [[Pamir]] Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The dam [[rises]] to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by [[Usoi]] Dam now holds [[Sarez]] Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.[[074]] cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water.

"The Basque conflict, also [[known]] as the Spain–[[ETA]] conflict, was an armed and political [[conflict]] between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque [[organizations]] which sought independence from Spain and France. The movement was built around the [[separatist]] organization [[ETA]] which since 1959 [[launched]] a campaign of attacks against Spanish administrations. In response, ETA was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the Spanish, British, French and American authorities. [[The]] conflict took place mostly on Spanish soil, although to a smaller degree it was also present in France, which was primarily used as a safe haven by ETA members. It was the [[longest]] running violent [[conflict]] in modern Western Europe. It has been sometimes referred to as \""Europe's longest war\"". The terminology is controversial. \""Basque conflict\"" is preferred by Basque nationalist groups, including those opposed to ETA violence. Spanish public opinion generally rejects the term, seeing it as legitimate state agencies fighting a terrorist group. The conflict has both political and military dimensions. Its participants include politicians and political activists on both sides, the [[abertzale]] left and the Spanish government, and the security forces of Spain and France fighting against ETA and other small organizations, usually involved in the [[kale]] borroka. Far-right paramilitary groups fighting against ETA were also active in the 1970s and 1980s.

"Álvaro Obregón [[Salido]] (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈalβaɾo oβɾeˈɣon]; February [[19]], 1880 – July 17, 1928) was a general in the Mexican Revolution, who became President of Mexico from 1920 to 1924.

Carranza appointed Obregón commander of the revolutionary forces in northwestern Mexico and in 1915 appointed him as his minister of [[war]].

"\""Don't Give Up on Us\"" is a [[song]] by American-British singer David Soul. Riding high on the success of playing in the hit TV show Starsky and Hutch, Soul returned to one of his early career choices as a singer. His debut, the Tony Macaulay-written-and-produced \""Don't Give Up on Us\"" was a worldwide smash, spending four weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in January and February 1977, and a single week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1977. In addition, the song spent one week at No. 1 on the U.S. adult contemporary chart. It has sold 1.16 million copies in the UK. Its B-side, \""Black Bean Soup\"", was a duet with actress Lynne Marta, whom Soul was involved with at the time. \""Don't Give Up on Us\"" was rated No. 93 in VH1's 100 Greatest One-hit Wonders because, despite having more hits in the UK, Soul was never again able to reach the top forty in the US. Soul recorded a new version of the song in 2004, allegedly after being embarrassed when hearing it by chance in an elevator as sung by Owen Wilson in the film version of Starsky and Hutch. Zsa Zsa Padilla revived this in 1998, making it the [[first]] Filipino revival. Piolo Pascual also covered this song for the soundtrack of the film of the same title in the Philippines.

"Faxinalipterus is a [[genus]] of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic [[Caturrita]] [[Formation]] of southern Brazil. [[The]] type species, Faxinalipterus minima was named and [[described]] in 2010 by José Fernando Bonaparte, Marina Bento Soares and César Leandro Schultz. The [[generic]] name is derived from [[Faxinal]] do Soturno and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""[[wing]]\"". The specific name, from Latin minimus, means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of [[Faxinal]] do [[Soturno]], Rio Grande do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian, 220–215 million years [[old]]. The [[holotype]], UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the [[collection]] of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb [[elements]], perhaps of a single individual. These do not include [[bones]] from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been [[referred]] to the species. Faxinalipterus is a rather [[small]] animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The [[hind]] limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be [[inferred]] that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and [[recurved]]. The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively [[short]] and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They [[see]] it as perhaps the oldest [[pterosaur]] known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the Caturrita Formation consists of terrestrial sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a terrestrial, not coastal, habitat. They also concluded Faxinalipterus is the most [[basal]] known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of [[fusion]] between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the scapula. However, Alexander Kellner has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"".

"Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien. The waltz principal melody was based on the waltz duet \""Könnt' ich mit Ihnen fliegen durchs Leben\"" or 'Could I but fly with you through life' sung in Act 2 of the operetta. The operetta itself was a success at its first performance and Strauss long adopted the practice of opera composers to draft melodies from their successful stage works to be arranged as a new piece to boost sales of sheet music, thus he composed this 'Cagliostro-Walzer'. The entire waltz consists of just 3 two-part waltz sections which is also a new Strauss development from the previous 5 two-part sections heard in his earlier works. The piece began with a loud march melody in the C major key before progressing into waltz time. The principal waltz theme in C major is also in the style of The Blue Danube, where three notes in rising melody starts off the waltz proper. Waltz 2A carries the principal key in C major as well but quickly interpolates with a more thoughtful passage in E-flat major. Waltz 3A starts off in F major in a hesitant mood, proceeding into a climax with cymbals. A brief coda enters and the entire Waltz 2B is repeated. After a short chorded passage, the swirling Waltz 1A recurs and Strauss signs off the waltz with a strong chord and long snare-drumroll.","Cagliostro-Walzer op.370 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1875 based on themes from his operetta, Cagliostro in Wien which premiered on 27 February 1875 at the famous Theater an der Wien.

"The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10. The club has a new sponsor with Hunter Medical Research Institute. The Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. The Newcastle Jets announced with the FFA and the State Government, that they would host the Los Angeles Galaxy at Energy Australia Stadium on 27 November. The match, an almost certain sellout, will play host to big name players; David Beckham, and Landon Donovan.","The Newcastle Jets 2010–11 [[weason]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000.

"[[Robert]] \""[[Bob]]\"" Fullam (1897–[[1974]]) was an [[Irish]] [[footballer]] and one of the best-known players in the League of Ireland in the [[1920s]] . A versatile attacking player, he was [[skilful]] but also had a tough-man image. born Ringsend, Fullam worked as a docker in Dublin, and played for Shelbourne F.C. 1918–21, winning the Irish Cup in 1920. He then transferred to Shamrock Rovers, and played in the inaugural Free State [[Cup]] final in 1922. In that match, his skirmishes with Charlie Dowdall of eventual champions St. James's Gate F.C. helped provoke post-match disturbances involving players and supporters. This led to a ban for the start of the following season. Nevertheless, he finished top scorer with 27 goals in 22 [[games]], as [[Rovers]] won their first League title. He transferred to Leeds United for 1923–[[24]] but played only seven games. He returned to Rovers the next season, helping them to the Double, as \""give it to Bob\"" became a Dublin catchphrase. [[In]] the 1926 Cup final, he famously pulled out of a goalmouth [[challenge]], sacrificing a goal (and the Cup) to prevent injuring the Fordsons goalkeeper. [[Fullam]] made his debut for the Irish Free State against Italy in Turin in 1926; he scored in the return match against Italy in 1927. As he was now 30, and the selectors had a preference for young players, this second cap was his last. He continued to play for Shamrock Rovers into the early 1930s. In 1927/28 he went to the United States along with Dinny Doyle and several other players from both North and South. Upon their arrival in Philadelphia they formed their own club which was known as Irish Philadelphia [[Celtic]]. After a year Bob returned to Dublin where he renewed his association with Rovers.
