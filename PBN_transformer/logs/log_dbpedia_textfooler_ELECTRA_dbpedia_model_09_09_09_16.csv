"[[Oleg]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[born]] 10 [[January]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] [[chess]] grandmaster and former European junior [[champion]]. [[Many]] [[honours]] and [[awards]] were [[bestowed]] on him as a [[young]] [[man]]. [[After]] [[winning]] the European [[Junior]] [[Championship]] in 1973, he [[became]] an [[International]] [[Master]] the same [[year]]. [[In]] 1974 he was a [[member]] of the victorious [[USSR]] [[team]] at the [[World]] [[Student]] [[Team]] [[Championship]] [[held]] in Teesside, [[England]], where he [[scored]] the [[best]] [[result]] for board 4 (8/9). The [[following]] year, he [[had]] a [[terrific]] [[result]] at the [[USSR]] [[Championship]], [[sharing]] [[second]] [[place]] with Boris Gulko, [[Mikhail]] Tal and [[Rafael]] Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster [[title]] was [[ratified]]. [[He]] [[has]] an [[impressive]] [[collection]] of tournament [[victories]] [[including]] [[Odessa]] 1974, Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan 1976, [[Hastings]] 1976/77, [[Leningrad]] 1977 ([[shared]] with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, [[Moscow]] 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 ([[shared]] with [[Andersson]] and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. [[Playing]] the [[Hungarian]] [[Open]] [[Championship]] at Györ in 1990 he [[enjoyed]] a most [[impressive]] [[victory]], [[finishing]] a [[clear]] 2 [[points]] [[ahead]] of the [[field]]. [[Second]] [[place]] [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and [[Dortmund]] 1982 (after Hort) were also [[important]] [[landmarks]] in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= [[finish]] at Sochi in 1982. [[Nowadays]] [[less]] [[active]] as a [[tournament]] [[player]], he [[has]] nevertheless [[maintained]] a [[highly]] [[competitive]] [[rating]] and is [[able]] to [[win]] [[smaller]] [[events]] on the grandmaster [[circuit]], such as Solin-Split 2004 and [[Hotel]] [[Petra]] ([[Rome]]) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he [[represented]] the [[Soviet]] [[Union]] in 1978 and thereafter [[played]] for [[Ukraine]] through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the [[European]] [[Team]] [[Chess]] [[Championships]] his [[medal]] haul has [[amounted]] to an [[incredible]] 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess [[playing]] [[style]] [[has]] been [[described]] as [[aggressive]] and this may [[be]] a [[result]] of the coaching he [[received]] as a junior. [[Along]] with a [[group]] of other [[aspiring]] masters, he was first [[coached]] by [[Viktor]] [[Kart]] (an [[instructor]] of the Lviv [[Sports]] Academy) and then, as an improver, was [[assigned]] a [[senior]] [[master]] as a [[tutor]]/[[mentor]].

[[In]] [[respect]] of chess [[opening]] theory, he [[has]] a [[reputation]] for the [[use]] of [[rare]], [[offbeat]] and [[sometimes]], long since discarded [[systems]]. [[Only]] by [[means]] of [[deep]] [[research]] and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One [[example]] is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[Alexei]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[welding]] 10 [[Janeiro]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Armenian]] [[inadequacy]] grandmaster and former European junior [[champions]].

The Greater London [[Authority]] (GLA) is a top-tier administrative body for Greater London, England. It consists of a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and an elected 25-member London Assembly with scrutiny powers. The authority was established in 2000, following a local referendum, and derives most of its powers from the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the Greater London Authority Act 2007. It is a strategic regional authority, with powers over transport, policing, economic development, and fire and emergency planning. Three functional bodies — Transport for London, the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority — are responsible for delivery of services in these areas.

"The [[Word]] is an American [[instrumental]]/sacred [[steel]]/[[gospel]] blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live [[concerts]], there is typically only one [[vocal]] microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a [[railroad]] [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no [[railroad]] crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 [[structures]] on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using [[techniques]] similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976.

[[Where]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no [[iron]] crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 [[build]] on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using [[technology]] similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976.

"Herbert Alexander Bruce FRCS ([[September]] 28, 1868 – [[June]] 23, 1963), served as the 15th Lieutenant [[Governor]] of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, [[Ontario]] near Port Perry, [[Bruce]] was [[educated]] as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of [[Toronto]] and in [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]]. [[He]] was a [[member]] of the [[Royal]] [[College]] of [[Surgeons]]. He [[owned]] [[Wellesley]] Hospital in [[Toronto]] which he [[founded]] in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of [[surgery]] at the University of [[Toronto]]. [[In]] 1916, during [[World]] [[War]] [[I]], he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian [[Army]] [[Medical]] [[Corps]] by [[Sir]] [[Sam]] [[Hughes]], and attained the rank of [[colonel]] in the Canadian [[Army]] ([[Permanent]] [[Active]] [[Militia]]). Bruce [[investigated]] medical [[practices]] in the [[army]] and [[issued]] a [[Report]] on the Canadian Army Medical [[Service]] which [[urged]] a [[complete]] reorganization of the medical [[corps]]. Few of his [[recommendations]] for [[general]] reorganization were [[immediately]] [[feasible]] from the military and economic points-of-view, and the [[manner]] of his [[appointment]] was [[protested]] by [[Sir]] [[William]] Osler as an affront to the medical [[profession]]. Bruce's [[report]] was [[disowned]] by the [[government]] at the [[time]] and he was [[dismissed]] from his [[duties]], while his [[conservative]] [[patron]], Hughes, was [[obliged]] to [[resign]]. [[In]] 1919, [[Bruce]] published [[Politics]] and the Canadian Army [[Medical]] [[Corps]], [[criticizing]] the [[government]] for its [[actions]] but [[avoiding]] any [[specific]] denunciation of Hughes. [[Later]] in the [[war]], as surgical [[consultant]] to the [[British]] [[forces]], Bruce was [[able]] to [[advance]] some [[useful]] reforms in surgical management, [[including]] [[greater]] [[reliance]] on nurse-anesthetists and operating [[room]] [[technicians]]. [[In]] 1920, Bruce [[purchased]] a [[farm]] on Bayview [[Avenue]] [[overlooking]] the [[Don]] [[Valley]] and [[built]] a Tudor-style [[mansion]] which he [[named]] Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of [[Ontario]] by R.[[B]]. Bennett for a [[term]] that lasted until 1937. He [[often]] verbally [[clashed]] with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who [[attempted]] to [[curtail]] the [[extravagance]] of the vice-regal [[office]] in the [[face]] of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's [[official]] [[residence]], Chorley [[Park]], was [[closed]] by the Hepburn [[government]] at the [[end]] of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting [[costs]]. [[While]] most lieutenant-governors are former [[politicians]], Bruce [[took]] the [[unusual]] step of [[entering]] [[politics]] [[following]] his [[term]] as the King's representative. [[Following]] the [[sudden]] [[death]] of [[Conservative]] [[MP]] David [[Spence]] in the [[middle]] of the 1940 [[federal]] [[election]] campaign, Bruce [[contested]] and won Spence's seat in the [[Canadian]] House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the [[Conservative]] [[Member]] of [[Parliament]] for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of [[conscription]]. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958.
