Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford [[Avenida]] of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia. Lee used Art Deco elements in combination with traditional building detailing. \n* Lansdowne [[Cinematographic]] \n* Sedgwick Theatre \n* The Seville Theater, now known as the Bryn Mawr Film Institute",0.3535316586494446,0.6664491891860962,0,2,0,740,"Successful"

[[He]] [[served]] in the [[Kentucky]] [[House]] of [[Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the state's [[Attorney]] [[General]] from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] from 1983 to 1987. [[After]] [[graduating]] from the [[University]] of [[Kentucky]] [[College]] of [[Law]] in 1968, Beshear [[briefly]] [[practiced]] [[law]] in New [[York]] before [[returning]] to [[Kentucky]] and being [[elected]] to the [[state]] legislature, where he [[gained]] a [[reputation]] as a [[consumer]] [[advocate]]. [[He]] parlayed that [[reputation]] into a [[term]] as [[attorney]] [[general]], [[serving]] under [[Governor]] [[John]] [[Y]]. [[Brown]], [[Jr]]. [[As]] [[attorney]] [[general]], Beshear [[issued]] an [[opinion]] that [[copies]] of the [[Ten]] [[Commandments]] would [[have]] to [[be]] [[removed]] from the walls of the state's [[classrooms]] in the [[wake]] of the U.S. [[Supreme]] Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first [[lady]] Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the [[practice]] of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. [[His]] most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's [[sparring]] with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into [[politics]] during this period was an [[unsuccessful]] challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under [[extended]] [[investigation]] by then-Attorney [[General]] [[Greg]] Stumbo, over [[violations]] of the state's [[merit]] [[system]]. [[In]] the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to [[expand]] casino gambling as a [[means]] of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith.
