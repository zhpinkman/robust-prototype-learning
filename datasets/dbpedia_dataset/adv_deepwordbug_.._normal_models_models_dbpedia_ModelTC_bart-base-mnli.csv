"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

Lee [[attended]] Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925.

[[AIA]] traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an [[insurance]] [[agency]] in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the [[US]], and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian [[AIA]] became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 [[AIA]] split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as [[ALICO]] (another [[AIG]] [[subsidiary]]), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities [[company]], announced that it [[would]] buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's Malaysian insurance subsidiaries for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). In December 2012, AIA was informed by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing agreement to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share.

"[[Iddo]] \""[[Snowy]]\"" [[Munro]] ([[26]] March [[1888]] – 27 October 1980) was an [[Australian]] [[racing]] [[cyclist]]. The highlights of his [[career]] were winning the Australasian long distance road championship in 1909 and competing in the 1914 Tour de France. [[Munro]] won the championship by winning the Blue Riband for the fastest time in the [[Warrnambool]] to Melbourne race. Munro set a record time of 7h 12' 51\"" which was not broken until 1931. Munro had a long association with the [[Warrnambool]] and his other efforts were 30th in 1907, 45th and fastest rider receiving over 10 minute start in 1908  and 60th in 1910. In 1914, Munro and Don Kirkham were the first Australian cyclists to compete in the Tour de France. Munro finished 20th in the general classification and his best result was 10th in Stage 15. There was some confusion about his given name, with some contemporary newspaper reports referring to him as \""Ivor\"".

In 1914 on his return from the Tour de France, Munro finished 14th and 2nd fastest in the Cycle Traders 100. Munro did not compete in 1912, having spent seven months traveling to England, France and America. [[His]] return to [[cycling]] in 1913 was successful, starting in four Victorian races between 25 and 80 miles finishing either first or fastest times in each with victories over top riders including twice defeating Don Kirkham. In 1915 Munro and others broke away from the League of Victorian Wheelmen to form the Victorian Racing Cyclists' Union  and competed at a meeting on 27 February 1915. As a consequence the League of Victorian Wheelmen disqualified those riders for twelve months from competing in races organised under the auspices of the League.

"Perfect Records was a [[United]] [[States-based]] record [[label]] [[founded]] in 1922 by Pathé [[Records]] to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of Perfect records were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era.

This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.","Perfect Records was a [[Unied]] [[States-baed]] record [[lable]] [[foundde]] in 1922 by Pathé [[Record]] to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

"Weyerbacher Brewing [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, [[United]] [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

"Federal elections were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after [[winning]] 153 of the 491 seats.

However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers.

"The 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was [[Small]] [[Heath]] [[Football]] [[Club's]] 13th in the Football League and their [[5th]] in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four [[points]] from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead.

[[During]] the [[event]], tours of the artworks and sculptures are undertaken by bicycle along the Upfield bike path, often with an opportunity for the cyclists to meet and engage with the artists. The works are located from Brunswick to Fawkner, and can be accessed by bicycle, train and on foot. The [[idea]] for the MoreArt [[event]] was coined by Dan Mitchell, Moreland City Council’s Public Art Officer. [[The]] [[event]] works \""By encouraging artists to draw inspiration from and utilise disused public space, MoreArt both inserts art into the those places already familiar – if hitherto invisible – to the local community, and invites both Moreland residents and others to subsequently discover – and perhaps better appreciate – the Moreland area while touring the MoreArt “exhibition”. Some artworks are located within the historic station buildings themselves and can include audio and video projections. Other locations include in front of the Brunswick Mechanics Institute and in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. In 2013 Koalas made from gray plastic bags by Coburg resident and artist Aaron James McGarry were tied up into eucalypt trees in Victoria Street Mall at Coburg. McGarry commented, \""The idea was to use an iconic native animal. They're one of the many flora and fauna plastic bags have an impact on. It's an environmental piece that looks at our impact as consumers.\"" In 2016 Moreland City Councillor and Mayor Samantha Ratnam said that MoreArt is significant in helping to bring the community together and in enhancing the historic railway station buildings. “Public art increases vibrancy and social cohesion in the community, economically it benefits the community by attracting more people, and importantly, by activating a space, it can change the perception of a space and the way it’s used,” Councillor Ratnam said.

"[[The]] Usoi [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] landslide [[dam]] [[along]] the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. [[At]] [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] [[ft]]) [[high]], it is the [[tallest]] dam in the world, either natural or man-made. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] [[rises]] to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by [[Usoi]] Dam now holds Sarez Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the [[dam]], which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the [[dam]] at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the Usoi [[Dam]] may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. The Murghab's river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep.

Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

Together with her siblings Lazarus and Martha, she is described by John as living in the village of Bethany near Jerusalem; in Luke only the two sisters, living in an unnamed village, are mentioned. Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two sets of sisters named as Mary and Martha are the same, though this is not conclusively stated in the Gospels, and the proliferation of New Testament \""Marys\"" is notorious. Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36–50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha.
