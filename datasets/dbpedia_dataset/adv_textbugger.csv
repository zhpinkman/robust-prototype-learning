In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh.

Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C.

"The Word is an Ameriœ≤an instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergrou—Ä —ñncludes wellÀóknown musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medseki (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Alstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-Norùöùh Mississippi Alstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unkno‘ùn Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and —ïing-song preaching that often escort such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut selùöè-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropea‘Åope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cu-tOff (also known as the New Jersey Cu-Off or HopatcongÀóSlateford Cut-Off) is a railroad ‚Öºine that was builùöù by the Delaware, Lacawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. Whenever it opened on December 24, 1911, the C’Ωt-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-arùöù rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. Nova iine was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main lineage between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The CutOff ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hpoatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-ff was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Ct-Off also had no iron traversing at the time of its construction. All 73 structrues on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material. The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Ctu-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Cornail cease‘Å operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. He removed the rails in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.",2
