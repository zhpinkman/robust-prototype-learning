"The [[Raid]] on [[Griessie]] was a British [[attack]] on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch [[East]] [[Indies]] in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. The raid was the final action in a series of [[engagements]] fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron‚Äîunder the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew‚Äîsought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander‚ÄîCaptain Cowell‚Äîrefused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire.

The raid was the final action in a series of [[enga…°ements]] fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron‚Äîunder the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew‚Äîsought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander‚ÄîCaptain Cowell‚Äîrefused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on Madura. With the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated.

"The [[Battle]] of [[Waxhaws]] (also known as the Waxhaws or Waxhaw [[massacre]], and Buford's massacre) [[took]] place during the American Revolutionary War on May 29, 1780, near Lancaster, [[South]] Carolina, between a Continental Army force led by Abraham Buford and a mainly Loyalist force led by British officer Banastre [[Tarleton]]. Buford refused an initial demand to surrender, but when his men were attacked by Tarleton's cavalry, many threw down their arms to surrender. Buford apparently attempted to surrender, however, the British commanding officer Tarleton was shot at during the truce, having his horse fall and trap him. Loyalists and British troops were outraged at the breaking of the truce in this manner and proceeded to fall on the rebels. While Tarleton was trapped under his dead horse, men continued killing the Continental soldiers, including men who were not resisting. Little quarter was given to the patriots/rebels. Of the 400 or so Continentals, 113 were killed with sabers, 150 so badly injured they could not be moved and 53 prisoners were taken by the British and Loyalists. \""Tarleton's quarter\"", thereafter became a common expression for refusing to take prisoners.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] League. [[Based]] in Milwaukee, [[Wisconsin]], their [[name]] was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978‚Äì1979 and 1979‚Äì1980, before disbanding. The [[team]] played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92‚Äì87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league. The team finished the 1978‚Äì79 season with a record of 11 wins and 23 losses, placing them in fourth and last place in the Midwest Division.

"[[Federal]] [[elections]] were [[held]] in [[Germany]] on 20 [[May]] 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter turnout was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann M√ºller. Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, M√ºller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","[[Federa‚Öº]] [[election—ï]] were [[h–µld]] in [[German—É]] on 20 [[Ma—É]] 1928.

As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the [[strongest]] foreseeing dream he has ever had.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] Marshalsea, Dublin (the City Marshalsea) was a debtor's [[prison]] located at the [[rear]] of Bridgefoot St. in [[Dublin]], Ireland.

"The [[Battle]] of [[Ni·∏´riya]] was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When ≈†uppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called ·∏™anigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Ur·∏´i-Te≈°ub), ·∏™anigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates.

(i.e. ·∏™attusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-a≈°ared I and precipitated a crisis with ·∏™atti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tud·∏´alia IV, ·∏™attusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Ni·∏´riya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-a≈°ared. The former idea that Ni·∏´riya was to be equated with Na‚Äôiri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong.

This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Ni·∏´riya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-a≈°ared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-a≈°ared. The former idea that Ni·∏´riya was to be equated with Na‚Äôiri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Ni·∏´riya was located in the Upper Balih region.",5

"[[The]] Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania.

"The Basque [[conflict]], also known as the Spain‚ÄìETA conflict, was an armed and political [[conflict]] between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque organizations which sought independence from Spain and France. The movement was built around the separatist organization ETA which since 1959 launched a campaign of attacks against Spanish administrations. In response, ETA was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the Spanish, British, French and American authorities. The conflict took place mostly on Spanish soil, although to a smaller degree it was also present in France, which was primarily used as a safe haven by ETA members. It was the longest running violent conflict in modern Western Europe. It has been sometimes referred to as \""Europe's longest war\"". The terminology is controversial. \""Basque conflict\"" is preferred by Basque nationalist groups, including those opposed to ETA violence. Spanish public opinion generally rejects the term, seeing it as legitimate state agencies fighting a terrorist group. The conflict has both political and military dimensions. Its participants include politicians and political activists on both sides, the abertzale left and the Spanish government, and the security forces of Spain and France fighting against ETA and other small organizations, usually involved in the kale borroka. Far-right paramilitary groups fighting against ETA were also active in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the debate on Basque independence started in the 19th century, the armed conflict did not start until ETA was created. Since then, the conflict has resulted in the death of more than 1,000 people, including police and security officers, members of the armed forces, Spanish politicians, journalists and civilians, and some ETA members.

"[[Faxinalipterus]] is a [[genus]] of [[vertebrate]], possibly a [[pterosaur]], from the [[Late]] Triassic Caturrita Formation of [[southern]] Brazil. The type [[species]], [[Faxinalipterus]] [[minima]] was named and [[described]] in [[2010]] by [[Jos√©]] Fernando [[Bonaparte]], [[Marina]] [[Bento]] Soares and [[C√©sar]] [[Leandro]] Schultz. The [[generic]] name is derived from Faxinal do Soturno and a Latinised Greek [[pteron]], \""wing\"". [[The]] [[specific]] name, from [[Latin]] minimus, means \""[[smallest]]\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were [[found]] in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.[[5]] kilometres northeast of Faxinal do [[Soturno]], Rio [[Grande]] do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation dating from the [[Carnian-Norian]], 220‚Äì[[215]] million years [[old]]. [[The]] [[holotype]], UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade [[Federal]] do Rio [[Grande]] do Sul and consists of several, [[partially]] [[fragmentary]], limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the [[hand]]. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. [[Faxinalipterus]] is a rather small [[animal]], with an estimated total humerus [[length]] of eighteen [[millimetres]]. The [[size]] has been compared to that of a [[sparrow]]. The [[hind]] limbs, [[much]] better [[conserved]] than the front [[limbs]], are relatively [[long]]. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is [[deep]] and lightly [[built]] with large openings. The [[maxillary]] teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned [[Faxinalipterus]] to the Pterosauria, based on its [[long]] [[hollow]] limbs and [[saddle-shaped]] upper joint of the relatively [[short]] and robust humerus, [[suitable]] to [[perform]] a [[wing]] stroke.

The type [[specie—ï]], [[Faxinalipteru—ï]] [[miniÔΩça]] was named and [[describe‘Å]] in [[20l0]] by [[Jo]] [[s√©]] Fernando [[Bona—Äarte]], [[Marin…ë]] [[Beno]] Soares and [[C√©s…ër]] [[Leando]] Schultz. The [[ge’∏eric]] name is derived from Faxinal do Soturno and a Latinised Greek [[ptero’∏]], \""wing\"". [[Te]] [[specfiic]] name, from [[Lat]] [[in]] minimus, means \""[[smallesùöù]]\"". Fossils of the [[specie—ï]] were [[fo’Ωnd]] in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.[[∆º]] kilometres northeast of Faxinal do [[Sotur’∏o]], Rio [[Gran‘Åe]] do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation dating from the [[CarnianÀóNorian]], 220‚Äì[[25]] million years [[ol‘Å]]. [[Te]] [[holoype]], UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade [[Fe]] [[deral]] do Rio [[Gran‘Åe]] do Sul and consists of several, [[partial‚Öºy]] [[fragmentry]], limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the [[han‘Å]]. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[specie—ï]]. [[Faxinalipteru—ï]] is a rather small [[an—ñmal]], with an estimated total humerus [[lengùöùh]] of eighteen [[millimetre—ï]]. The [[si·¥¢e]] has been compared to that of a [[sparro‘ù]]. The [[hin‘Å]] limbs, [[muh]] better [[conserve‘Å]] than the front [[libms]], are relatively [[‚Öºong]]. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is [[‘Åeep]] and lightly [[builùöù]] with large openings. The [[maxilla‚≤Öy]] teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned [[Faxinaliptreus]] to the Pterosauria, based on its [[‚Öºong]] [[hollo‘ù]] limbs and [[sadd‚Öºe-shaped]] upper joint of the relatively [[shorùöù]] and robust humerus, [[siutable]] to [[perforÔΩç]] a [[‘ùing]] stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it [[poss—ñbly]] predates European finds from the Norian.

Incumbent Republican Senator Mel Mart√≠nez, who was elected in a very close race against Democrat Betty Castor with 49% of the vote in 2004, announced on December 2, 2008, that he would not run for re-election to a second term, then announcing on August 7, 2009, that he would resign prior to the end of his term. The Governor of Florida, Republican Charlie Crist, was required to appoint a successor and he chose his former Chief of Staff, George LeMieux. LeMieux, a placeholder who did not run in the election, replaced Mart√≠nez in the Senate on September 10, 2009. [[Crist]] publicly announced he was running for the seat in mid-2009. When he declared his candidacy, he received many Republican endorsements, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Mart√≠nez, and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. However, his support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives, and Tea Party candidate Marco Rubio, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, surged in the polls. In April 2010, Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent. The National Republican Senatorial Committee withdrew its endorsement of Crist and demanded a refund of its campaign funds that it provided for the Crist campaign. Rubio went on to win the Republican primary against only token opposition. U.S. Representative Kendrick Meek was the first Democrat to declare his intention to run and he defeated billionaire businessman Jeff Greene in his party's primary. Also on the ballot were Alexander Snitker, the first member of the Libertarian Party on the ballot for the U.S. Senate in Florida's history, Bernie DeCastro of the Constitution Party, and five other Independent candidates. Polling initially showed Crist neck and neck with Rubio, but by the end of August Rubio opened up a solid and consistent lead. He was supported by Republican and some Independent voters whereas Democratic and other Independents were split between Crist and Meek.

Together with her [[siblings]] Lazarus and Martha, she is described by John as living in the village of Bethany near Jerusalem; in Luke only the two sisters, living in an unnamed village, are mentioned. Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two sets of sisters named as Mary and Martha are the same, though this is not conclusively stated in the Gospels, and the proliferation of New Testament \""Marys\"" is notorious. Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36‚Äì50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha. In Eastern Christianity and some Protestant traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people.

Most Christian commentators have been ready to assume that the two sets of sisters named as Mary and Martha are the same, though this is not conclusively stated in the Gospels, and the proliferation of New Testament \""Marys\"" is notorious. Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36‚Äì50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha. In Eastern Christianity and some Protestant traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people. The Orthodox Church has its own traditions regarding Mary of Bethany's life beyond the gospel accounts.",0

[[The]] [[area]] protected [[comprises]] four national parks clustered together that became La [[Amistad]] [[Biosphere]] Reserve. UNESCO declared it a [[natural]] World Heritage [[Site]] in 1983. It is part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, UNESCO's project shared by eight Central American countries (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala and [[South]] of Mexico) to help protect the remaining [[pristine]] mountain forest and wildlife of Central America Kamuk peak rises to 3,549 metres (11,644 ft) above sea level. It takes 4 days to reach the its top, one way (7 days for the complete expedition). Journeys require about 6 to 10 hours hiking per day. [[The]] climb to the summit is nontechnical, but since the trail often gets consumed by its own wildlife, it is absolutely necessary to have a certified guide. There are no [[trail]] signs and water is found only near campsites. The absolute fragility and unspoiled nature of this area requires that explorers take very important precautions: take only new tenting and camping equipment, free of spores, mildew or other microorganisms, as they may cause an [[ecological]] disaster. Wash your hiking boots and make sure you bring no soil from other areas of the world. The season to explore the Talamanca Range and climb Kamuk ranges from November to April only, and is closed the rest of the year due to heavy [[rains]], tree falls, management and protection of species.

"The Pimlico Special is an American thoroughbred horse [[race]] [[held]] at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland in mid May. It is raced on dirt over a distance of ‚Ää1 3‚ÅÑ16 miles (9.5 furlongs). The race is currently open to horses age three and older and offers a purse of $300,000. The Pimlico Special was first run in 1937 and was won by that year's U.S. Triple Crown winner War Admiral who went on to be voted the American Horse of the Year. In 1938, the Pimlico Special was host to one of American racing's historic moments when Seabiscuit defeated War Admiral in a much anticipated match race. That race was covered by almost every major newspaper, magazine and radio station of the time. Discontinued after 1958, the race was revived as a handicap event in 1988 and made a graded stakes race one year later in 1989. The race was not eligible for grading in 2011 because it had not been run the previous two years. Eighteen Pimlico Special winners have gone on to win a Championship for Horse of the Year or an Eclipse Award as the best horse in their divisions.

"No. 51 [[Squadron]] [[RAF]] [[Regiment]] is a field [[squadron]] of the [[RAF]] [[Regiment]] in the Royal Air [[Force]]. Its mission is [[protection]] of RAF bases from [[ground]] [[attack]]. The history of No. [[51]] Squadron goes [[back]] to [[1947]] when it was [[formed]] at RAF [[Celle]] near the [[L√ºneburg]] Heath in Germany by the redesignation of No. [[2713]] [[Squadron]] [[RAF]] [[Regiment]]. Its initial role was as a rifle squadron, [[protecting]] RAF facilities from ground attack. In 1955 it changed to the light anti-aircraft role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. In 1964 the squadron reformed, switching back to the [[rifle]] role, at the RAF [[Regiment]] Depot. The first assignments of the [[unit]] after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it [[undertook]] internal security roles. After Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence in 1965 it was sent to Africa to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. After returning to Catterick the [[unit's]] next deployment was back to Aden in the immediate period before the British withdrawal from there in 1967. Its [[service]] in Aden was [[mainly]] spent at the many isolated airfields dotting that colony. In 1968 the squadron shifted bases with a move to RAF Wittering. This move was undertaken to support the [[Hawker]] Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming operational. With the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, No. 51 Squadron deployed to the province, a process which it would repeat at regular intervals for the next 18 [[years]]. This [[period]] also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and Hong Kong. In 1982 the squadron moved back to Catterick from Wittering to [[re-role]]. It emerged operating the Combat [[Vehicle]] Reconnaissance (tracked) family and in wartime it would have moved to Germany to defend airfields there. However its next war service was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. [[In]] aftermath of the [[Iraqi]] invasion of Kuwait the squadron deployed to Arabia and detachments saw service at Dharan, Muharraq and Tabuk during the war. Following the Options for Change [[defence]] cuts the squadron was disbanded in [[1993]]. The dawn of a [[new]] century saw a return to [[active]] service for the squadron. Once again operating in a field [[squadron]] [[role]], it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before [[moving]] to RAF Lossiemouth. It was not long before war beckoned again and the squadron was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the invasion it has [[taken]] part in roulements back to the region.

"[[The]] [[Algiers]] putsch (French: Putsch d'Alger or Coup d'√âtat d'Alger), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des g√©n√©raux), was a failed coup d'√©tat to overthrow French President Charles de Gaulle and establish a military junta. Organised in French Algeria by retired French army generals Maurice Challe (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), Edmond Jouhaud (former Inspector General of the French Air Force), Andr√© Zeller (former Chief of staff of the French Ground Army) and Raoul Salan (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), it took place from the afternoon of 21 April to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962). The organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debr√©'s government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). General Raoul Salan stated that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been considered a four-man coup d'√©tat, or as de Gaulle famously put it, \""un quarteron de g√©n√©raux en retraite\"" (a handful of retired generals / generals in retreat). The coup was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French Algeria's major cities Algiers, Oran and Constantine, followed by the seizure of Paris. The metropolitan operation would be led by Colonel Antoine Argoud, with French paratroopers descending on strategic airfields. The commanders in Oran and Constantine, however, refused to follow Challe's demand that they join the coup. At the same time, information about the metropolitan phase came to Prime Minister Debr√©'s attention through the intelligence service. On 22 April, all flights and landings were forbidden in Parisian airfields, and an order was given to the army to resist the coup \""by all means\"".
