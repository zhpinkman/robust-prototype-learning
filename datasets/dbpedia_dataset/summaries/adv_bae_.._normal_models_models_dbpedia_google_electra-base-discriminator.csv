"[[On]] 20 October 1990, Manchester [[United]] Football Club [[faced]] Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division [[fixture]] at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best [[remembered]] for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"The Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the [[short-lived]] Women's Professional Basketball League. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their [[name]] was a [[play]] on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks.

The [[team]] [[played]] its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. [[The]] league [[played]] its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation [[likening]] this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their [[brews]] are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India [[pale]] ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

[[spectroscopy]] has [[showing]] that Sedna's surface composition is similar to that of some other trans-Neptunian [[material]], being largely a [[combination]] of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its [[bedo]] is one of the reddest among Solar System [[types]]. It is most likely a dwarf planet. For most of its [[orbits]], it is even farther from the Sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at 937 [[times]] (31 times Neptune's distance), [[make]] it one of the most distant known [[object]] in the Solar System other than long-period comets.

Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it. The project required construction of the Jerusalem Chords Bridge as well as other renovation projects around Jerusalem. After repeated delays due to archaeological discoveries and technical issues, service began, initially free of charge, on August 19, 2011. It became fully operational on December 1, 2011.

The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had [[played]] together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year [[history]].

Ranging from [[demo]] to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, [[american]] jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental [[pieces]], and for their devoted fan base, known as \""[[fans]]\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering [[work]] of the jam band world\"". The band was [[reviewed]] 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was [[appointed]] into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their [[seton]] Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the [[collection]] of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had [[met]] together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year [[period]]. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna [[murphy]] (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.",0

"Turkey, [[whose]] relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, [[condemned]] its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil [[War]], Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012.

Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory.

"The men's single sculls competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. This rowing [[event]] is a single scull event, meaning that each [[boat]] is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion [[means]] that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). [[The]] competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to [[determine]] the [[placing]] of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to [[qualify]] for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would [[race]] in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal [[moved]] on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.

Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the top four of their heat, top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.","The men's single sculls competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[won]] [[silver]] at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. This rowing [[type]] is a single scull event, meaning that each [[canoe]] is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion [[mentions]] that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). [[an]] competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to [[find]] the [[semifinals]] of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to [[apply]] for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would [[receive]] in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal [[got]] on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals. Six semifinals were [[placed]], two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and [[br]]/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final. The fourth and final round was the Finals. Each final determined a set of [[quarterfinals]].

"[[The]] Basque conflict, also known as the Spain–ETA conflict, was an armed and political [[conflict]] between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a [[group]] of social and political Basque organizations which sought [[independence]] from Spain and France.

"The Glass Bottle was an American pop [[band]] fronted by Gary Criss, whose song about bitterness and heartbreak, \""I Ain't Got Time Anymore\"", was recorded in 1970 and reached #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September 1971. The band was co-produced by Dickie Goodman. Goodman had an advertising deal with a PR firm that was trying to save the glass industry from losing soda pop clients to plastic bottles, so Goodman and partner Bill Ramal formed a group, called them \""The Glass Bottle\"" and produced their album.

The [[line]] has at various [[stages]] been proposed as a automated people mover, [[tram-train]], tramway, [[light]] rail, stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail.

"[[No]]. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment is a field [[squadron]] of the RAF Regiment in the Royal Air [[Force]]. [[Its]] mission is protection of RAF bases from [[ground]] attack. The history of No. 51 [[Squadron]] goes back to 1947 when it was [[formed]] at RAF Celle near the Lüneburg Heath in Germany by the redesignation of No. 2713 Squadron RAF [[Regiment]]. Its [[initial]] role was as a rifle squadron, protecting RAF facilities from ground attack. In 1955 it changed to the light [[anti-aircraft]] role which it retained until disbanded in 1957. In 1964 the [[squadron]] reformed, switching back to the rifle role, at the RAF Regiment Depot. [[The]] first assignments of the unit after reforming were overseas to Cyprus and Aden where it undertook internal security roles. After Rhodesia [[unilaterally]] declared independence in 1965 it was sent to Africa to protect Gloster Javelin aircraft which were deployed in Zambia. [[After]] [[returning]] to Catterick the unit's next deployment was back to Aden in the immediate period before the British withdrawal from there in 1967. [[Its]] service in Aden was mainly spent at the many isolated airfields [[dotting]] that colony. In 1968 the squadron shifted bases with a move to RAF Wittering. This move was undertaken to [[support]] the Hawker Siddeley Harrier force which was then becoming operational. With the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969, No. 51 Squadron [[deployed]] to the province, a process which it would repeat at regular intervals for the next 18 years. This period also saw deployments to RAF Salalah and Hong Kong. In 1982 the [[squadron]] moved back to Catterick from Wittering to re-role. It emerged operating the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked) family and in wartime it would have moved to Germany to defend airfields there. However its next war service was not to be in Europe but in the Middle East. In [[aftermath]] of the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]] the squadron deployed to [[Arabia]] and [[detachments]] saw service at Dharan, Muharraq and Tabuk during the war. Following the Options for Change defence cuts the [[squadron]] was disbanded in 1993. The dawn of a new century saw a return to active service for the squadron. Once again operating in a field [[squadron]] role, it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before moving to RAF Lossiemouth.

"The great white shark ([[Carcharodon]] [[carcharias]]), [[also]] known as the great white, white pointer, white shark, or white death, is a [[species]] of large lamniform shark which can be [[found]] in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is notable for its size, with mature female [[individuals]] growing up to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,950 kg (4,300 lb) in weight. However most are smaller, males measuring 3.35 to 3.96 m (11 ft 0 in to 13 ft 0 in) and females 4.57 to 4.88 m (15 ft 0 in to 16 ft 0 in) on average. According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more, well above older estimates, making it one of the longest lived cartilaginous fish currently known. According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring. Great white sharks can accelerate to over 56 km/h (35 mph) for short bursts. The great white shark has no known natural [[predators]] other than the killer whale. The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals.

"Pinot noir (French: [pino [[nwaʁ]]]) is a red wine [[grape]] variety of the [[species]] Vitis [[vinifera]]. The name may also refer to [[wines]] [[created]] [[predominantly]] from Pinot noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for pine and black; the pine alluding to the grape variety having tightly clustered, pine cone-shaped bunches of fruit. Pinot noir grapes are grown around the world, mostly in the cooler regions, but the grape is chiefly associated with the Burgundy region of France. Other regions that have gained a reputation for Pinot noir include the Willamette Valley of Oregon, the Carneros, Central Coast and Russian River AVAs (American Viticultural Area) of California, the Elgin and Walker Bay wine regions of South Africa, Tasmania and Yarra Valley in Australia and the Central Otago, Martinborough and Marlborough wine regions of New Zealand. Pinot noir is [[also]] a primary [[variety]] used in sparkling wine production in [[Champagne]] and other wine [[regions]]. It is widely considered to produce some of the finest wines in the world, but is a [[difficult]] [[variety]] to cultivate and transform into wine. [[The]] grape's tendency to produce tightly packed clusters [[makes]] it susceptible to several [[viticultural]] hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management. The thin-skins and [[low]] levels of phenolic compounds lends Pinot to producing mostly lightly [[colored]], medium bodied low tannin wines that can often go through dumb phases with uneven and unpredictable aging.

"1750 Eckert, provisional designation 1950 [[NA1]], is a stony asteroid, slow rotator, and Mars-crosser from the inner regions of the asteroid belt. It was [[discovered]] by German [[astronomer]] Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory on 15 July 1950. The asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, a group that forms the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. It measures about 7 kilometers in diameter and orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6–2.3 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.17 and is tilted by 19 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Every 375 hours, it slowly [[rotates]] once around its axis. This is the sixth-longest rotation period of all known Mars-crossing asteroids. [[The]] S-type asteroid has an albedo of 0.20, based on observations by the Japanese Akari satellite. The minor [[planet]] was named in memory of American astronomer Wallace [[Eckert]] (1902–1971), director at the United States Naval Observatory from 1940 to 1945, president of IAU's Commission 7, and pioneer in the use of automatic computing machines. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he used the then most powerful computing machines ever built, SSEC and NORC, for astronomical calculations. The asteroid 1625 The NORC was named after one of these early super-computers. Eckert also produced the integration of the orbits of the five outer planets in collaboration with Brouwer and Clemence, after whom the minor planets [[1746]] Brouwer and 1919 Clemence were named. By use of sophisticated computing techniques, Eckert was able to check and extend Brown's lunar theory (also see 1643 Brown).","1750 Eckert, provisional designation 1950 [[cm]], is a stony asteroid, slow rotator, and Mars-crosser from the inner regions of the asteroid belt.

Over the years, the station successfully hosted a wide variety of programmes including soap operas, local and international news, educational documentaries such as the School Broadcasting Unit's show, which aired around 10a.m. on Mondays to Fridays when school was in session, and The Passing Parade hosted by John Doremus. The station's announcers included June Gonsalves, Barbara Assoon, Glen Antoine, Sam Ghany, Ken Laughlin, Hugh Blackman, Larry Heywood, Val Douglas, Russell Winston, Trevor McDonald, Holly Betaudier, Peter Minshall, Don Proudfoot, Bob Gittens and Raffie Knowles.

"Simplicius, Constantius and Victorinus ([[Victorian]](us)) (Italian: Simplicio, Costanzo e Vittoriano) are venerated as [[Christian]] martyrs of the 2nd century. Simplicius, was, according to tradition, a Christian of the Abruzzi region who was executed along with his two sons, Constantius and Victorian, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Their Passio contains all of the tropes of the genre. It is believed that the martyrdoms are genuine but that the three martyrs were not necessarily related to one another, but were executed together at Marsica. The earliest source on their [[life]] actually dates from a Passio of 1406. The Passio [[states]] that Simplicius and his entire family, natives of Bourgogne, were [[baptized]] by Saint Januarius (not, according to Antonio Borrelli, the famous saint of Naples) during the [[reign]] of Antoninus Pius (138-161). Gaudentia, the wife of Simplicius, became a nun and withdrew to a monastery, while Simplicius and his two sons [[Constantius]] and Victorinus preached on behalf of their new religion. Pontius, the [[prefect]] in Gaul, was ordered to arrest all Christians; [[Simplicius]] and his two sons were arrested and led in front of the court, where they preached the Trinity and the Absolution. [[They]] were flogged and sent to Rome in order to be condemned to death. According to the legend, during the journey, the saints cured a child of blindness. At Rome, they wished to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul, but the guards prohibited this. However, God liberated them from their chains, allowing them to make the pilgrimage to the tombs with a group of Christians. The pilgrimage resulted in a [[fight]] erupting between the Christians and pagans; the pagans suffered many losses. [[The]] [[three]] saints were once again arrested and brought to Antoninus Pius at Marsica.

They were then [[condemned]] to be torn apart by four maddened heifers, but these beasts refused to move. Finally, on [[August]] 26, 159, they were beheaded at Celano, at a spot called Aureum fontem (\""Golden Springs\""), identified by the writer of the Passio as the future site of the church of San Giovanni Vecchio in Celano, with the spring eventually becoming known as S. Ioannis in capite acquae.

"[[Presidential]] elections were held in France on 24 April and 8 [[May]] 1988. [[In]] 1981, the Socialist Party leader, [[François]] Mitterrand, was elected President of France and the [[Left]] won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the [[right]] regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was [[forced]] to \""[[cohabit]]\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR [[leader]] Jacques Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President [[focused]] on his \""reserved domain\"" – foreign affairs and defense policy. [[Moreover]], several other prominent candidates opposed the two heads of the executive. [[Chirac's]] cabinet advocated liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social [[movements]], [[supported]] covertly by [[President]] Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was [[challenged]] by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond [[Barre]]. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", claiming that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth Republic\"".

"Harris [[v]]. Balk, 198 [[U]].[[S]]. 215 (1905) was a United States Supreme Court [[case]] that exemplified the [[bizarre]] [[types]] of jurisdiction state courts (and therefore plaintiffs) could assert through quasi in rem [[actions]] before International Shoe's \""minimum contacts\"" test replaced [[Pennoyer's]] principles of \""power and notice\"". This case involved three parties: Harris, Balk, and Epstein. Harris owed [[Balk]] money and Balk owed Epstein money. Thus, there was no debt relationship between Harris and Epstein. Harris and Balk lived in North [[Carolina]] while Epstein lived in [[Maryland]]. Harris traveled to Maryland. While he was there, Epstein attached the debt Harris [[owed]] Balk in order for [[Epstein]] to obtain jurisdiction over Balk. Through this, Epstein hoped to [[obtain]] the debt that [[Balk]] owed him by accessing the debt Harris owed [[Balk]]. Consequently, Epstein [[obtained]] a judgment against Balk which directed [[Harris]] to pay [[Epstein]] instead of Balk. To understand the principles in this case, one must [[understand]] a little about quasi in rem actions and jurisdictional principles at the time. At that time, a state court could not assert in [[personam]] jurisdiction over someone who was not physically [[served]] process in that state. However, if a defendant, on whom in personam jurisdiction was unable to be asserted, owned [[property]] in the state in which plaintiff was [[situated]], plaintiff could \""[[attach]]\"" to the action whatever property defendant owned in that state. Such an action was labeled [[quasi-in]] rem and, when this [[occurred]], state courts were permitted to assert jurisdiction over an [[out-of-state]] defendant on any matter, with the limitation that any remedy be limited to involving only the attached property. Applying the above principles to this case, debt (money owed to someone) is considered actual property of the creditor. [[Importantly]], at the time of Harris v. Balk, debt was [[considered]] to \""follow the debtor\"" (i.e., wherever a debtor went, he brought along the debt he owed to his creditor). When Harris entered Maryland, he \""[[brought]] along\"" the debt he owed to Balk (Harris's [[debt]] to Balk being Balk's property). This enabled Epstein to attach it in a quasi-in rem action and obtain jurisdiction over Balk. The principles [[allowing]] the Maryland state court to assert jurisdiction in this case were subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court case in [[Shaffer]] v. Heitner.","Harris [[e]]. Balk, 198 [[v]].[[sec]]. 215 (1905) was a United States Supreme Court [[cases]] that exemplified the [[usual]] [[sense]] of jurisdiction state courts (and therefore plaintiffs) could assert through quasi in rem [[decisions]] before International Shoe's \""minimum contacts\"" test replaced [[existing]] principles of \""power and notice\"". This case involved three parties: Harris, Balk, and Epstein. Harris owed [[evans]] money and Balk owed Epstein money. Thus, there was no debt relationship between Harris and Epstein. Harris and Balk lived in North [[carolina]] while Epstein lived in [[washington]]. Harris traveled to Maryland. While he was there, Epstein attached the debt Harris [[debt]] Balk in order for [[epstein]] to obtain jurisdiction over Balk. Through this, Epstein hoped to [[reconcile]] the debt that [[d]] owed him by accessing the debt Harris owed [[afterwards]]. Consequently, Epstein [[instituted]] a judgment against Balk which directed [[harris]] to pay [[money]] instead of Balk. To understand the principles in this case, one must [[learn]] a little about quasi in rem actions and jurisdictional principles at the time. At that time, a state court could not assert in [[actual]] jurisdiction over someone who was not physically [[working]] process in that state. However, if a defendant, on whom in personam jurisdiction was unable to be asserted, owned [[jurisdiction]] in the state in which plaintiff was [[located]], plaintiff could \""[[claim]]\"" to the action whatever property defendant owned in that state. Such an action was labeled [[en]] rem and, when this [[started]], state courts were permitted to assert jurisdiction over an [[assumed]] defendant on any matter, with the limitation that any remedy be limited to involving only the attached property. Applying the above principles to this case, debt (money owed to someone) is considered actual property of the creditor. [[later]], at the time of Harris v. Balk, debt was [[applied]] to \""follow the debtor\"" (i.e., wherever a debtor went, he brought along the debt he owed to his creditor). When Harris entered Maryland, he \""[[sued]] along\"" the debt he owed to Balk (Harris's [[relating]] to Balk being Balk's property). This enabled Epstein to attach it in a quasi-in rem action and obtain jurisdiction over Balk. The principles [[directing]] the Maryland state court to assert jurisdiction in this case were subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court case in [[epstein]] v. Heitner.",4

"The Interior Museum is a museum operated by the United States [[Department]] of the Interior and housed at the Department's headquarters at the Stewart Lee Udall Main Interior [[Building]] in Washington, D.C., on the first floor. When the Interior Museum opened in the U.S. Department of the Interior's newly-constructed headquarters in the nation's capital on March 8, 1938, a museum was considered a novel element to include in a federal office building. However, the Secretary of the Interior at that time—Harold Ickes (1874-1952)—was a proponent of the arts and also strongly believed in the importance of having the American people understand the work of the Department. To this day, the Interior Museum's mission remains to actively educate and inspire employees and the public about the ongoing stewardship of the nation's public lands, natural resources and cultural heritage. The Interior Museum's collection contains more than 6,000 objects of historical, cultural and scientific importance relating directly to the activities of the Department. In addition to developing exhibitions and public programs, Interior Museum staff also conduct public tours highlighting the elements that made the Stewart Lee Udall Department of the Interior Building a \""symbol of a new day\"" during the Great Depression.

"The Vancouver Dragons were a professional basketball [[team]] in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of [[seven]] (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to [[play]] 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat [[Agrodome]] in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was [[deferred]] until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the [[run-up]] to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center [[project]] to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle [[suburb]], to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league [[gave]] [[Tuckman]] permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being [[built]] at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and [[changed]] the [[name]] to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams.

When they first started, the idea of the band was to make some extra money while they were in school. That plan included disbanding the group at graduation, which they did in the summer of 1973. After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B. Smith and Phil Barry returned to Oshkosh from New York and Chicago, respectively, and reformed the band in the spring of 1974. Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow. With some creative marketing, they became a headliner band in a very short period of time. They had a large fan base and enjoyed considerable popularity in the Midwest from 1972 through 1979.

"[[Radio]] West Fife is one of Scotland's oldest hospital radio stations and [[broadcasts]] by landline to the Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline. From its humble beginnings in September 1953, when broadcasting from a shed in the grounds of the West Fife Hospital, the station has grown considerably. This has been achieved partly through the fundraising efforts of the members and partly through sponsorships. In the early days the station focused on live broadcasts from Dunfermline Athletic Football Club’s home games at East End Park, but now broadcasts a mix of music and specialist output including religious programmes. Following a spell of broadcasting from a caravan at Milesmark Hospital, the station moved to the grounds of Lynebank Hospital in 1993.

"[[The]] Hobart [[Private]] Hospital is a 146 bed private hospital located in the central business district of Hobart [[adjacent]] to the Royal Hobart Hospital. It is owned by [[Healthscope]], one of Australia's leading providers of [[hospitals]], medical and pathology centres. The Hobart [[Private]] Hospital provides private health care specialising in the areas of emergency, cardiac, maternity, [[orthopaedics]], gastroenterology, urology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, respiratory medicine, rehab and general surgery. History-The Hobart Private Hospital was established in 1999 following the Government of Tasmania's decision to privatise the Queen Alexandria maternity [[wing]] attached to the Royal Hobart Hospital. Many were opposed to the privatisation of the wing, but it was a policy agenda of Tony Rundle's Liberal Party (in power 1996-1998) to privatise the bulk of Tasmania's public infrastructure. Australian Hospital [[Care]] Limited purchased the site following the sale of the Queen Alexandra wing in 1999, but soon found themselves compulsorily purchased by Mayne Nickless Limited (now Mayne Group Limited). Despite the Liberal Party's determination to make their policy of privatisation of public infrastructure work, the private sector in Hobart, which is a relatively small market, was already well served by Calvary Hospital, St Johns Calvary Hospital and St Helens Private Hospital, and Hobart Private was experiencing financial difficulties within months of opening. Despite frequent requests from the board of the Royal [[Hobart]] Hospital to the Tasmanian Government for them to reacquire the site in order that the RHH could make much need expansions, the owners of Hobart Private refused to sell unless all three of their Tasmanian Hospitals were bought in one package. By 2001 Healthscope had bought Hobart Private from Mayne Health, and through shrewd management made it profitable. The Royal continued to apply pressure on the government to buy the site, as they were becoming desperate to expand, but Healthscope, now turning a profit, rejected it out of hand. Also the increasing need to turn profit for shareholders led to a reduction of service provision, and the Liberal's grand vision of a private sector which would solve all of the government's healthcare problems was falling apart. In 2005 premier Paul Lennon again requested the return of the site in order to aid the desperate need for the Royal's redevelopment, but the request was again flatly refused by Healthscope. By June 2005, the Hbart Private was having problems with accreditiation and facilities management, and even had to be evacuated due to flooding. By August 2005 the Hobart Private Hospital had been flagged by Australia's national healthcare standards organisation as one of 26 hospitals nationally that was failing to meet required standards, however this report was claimed to be misrepresentative by Healthscope's chief medical officer, Michael Coglin.","[[the]] Hobart [[city]] Hospital is a 146 bed private hospital located in the central business district of Hobart [[linked]] to the Royal Hobart Hospital.

"Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (Bengali: বাংলাদেশ জামায়াতে ইসলামী), previously [[known]] as Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, or Jamaat for short, is the largest Islamist political [[party]] in [[Bangladesh]]. [[On]] 1 August 2013 the Bangladesh Supreme Court [[declared]] the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami illegal, [[ruling]] that the party is unfit to contest national polls.

It is said that the predecessor of the party (Jamaat-e-Islami [[Pakistan]]) strongly opposed the independence of Bangladesh and break-up of Pakistan. In 1971, it collaborated with the Pakistani Army in its operations against Bengali nationalists and pro-liberation intellectuals. [[Upon]] the [[independence]] of Bangladesh in 1971, the new government [[banned]] Jamaat-e-Islami from political participation and its leaders [[went]] into exile in Pakistan.

"4450 [[Pan]], provisional designation 1987 SY, is a highly eccentric, contact-binary [[asteroid]], [[classified]] as a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous [[object]]. It [[belongs]] to the group of Apollo asteroids and [[measures]] approximately 1.1 kilometers in diameter. It was [[discovered]] on 25 [[September]] 1987, by American astronomers Eugene and Carolyn [[Shoemaker]] at the [[U]].[[S]] Palomar Observatory in California. The stony S-type asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.3 AU once every 633 [[days]] (1 year and 9 months). Its orbit has a [[high]] eccentricity of 0.59 and an inclination of 6° with [[respect]] to the ecliptic. As an [[Apollo]] asteroid, it is an Earth-crosser and has a minimum orbit intersection [[distance]] with Earth of 0.0283 AU (4,230,000 km) or 11.0 lunar distances. In [[addition]], due to its [[extremely]] eccentric orbit, it is [[also]] a Venus- and Mars-crosser and approaches Mercury within 20 Gm. [[Its]] first [[observation]] was [[made]] at Heidelberg Observatory in 1937, [[yet]] it [[remained]] unused and the asteroid's observation arc [[begins]] with its discovery observation in 1987. The [[asteroid]] is a contact binary, [[composed]] of two lobes in [[mutual]] contact, held together only by their weak gravitational attraction, and typically [[show]] a dumbbell-like shape (also see 4769 [[Castalia]]). A large number of near-Earth objects are [[thought]] to be contact binaries.

In [[September]] 2013, a rotational [[light-curve]] of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by [[U]].S. astronomer Brian [[D]]. Warner at his [[Palmer]] [[Divide]] Station in [[Colorado]]. [[It]] [[gave]] a long rotation period of 56.48±[[0]].02 hours with a brightness variation of 0.64 in magnitude ([[U]]=[[3]]).
