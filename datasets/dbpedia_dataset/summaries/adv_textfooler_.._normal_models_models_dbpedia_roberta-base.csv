The three chancel windows were designed by Franz Mayer & Co. and represent \""the Saviour\"", \""St. Francis de Sales\"" and \""St. Margaret of Scotland\"". The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's features 17 impressive stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Tiffany windows include \""The Education Of The Virgin\"", \""The Annunciation\"", \""The Marriage Of Joseph And Mary\"" and \""The Baptism of Jesus\"".

"Russells [[Hall]] [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] [[located]] in Dudley, West Midlands, [[England]], run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The [[hospital]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished.

"\""Space [[Invaders]]\"" is a [[song]] by Australian songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown, recording under the band name Player One (commonly stylised as Player [1]) in 1979. The song is based on the hugely successful 1978 video game Space Invaders. It was a novelty hit in Australia, peaking at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report charts, and ending up as the fourth best selling single in Australia for 1980. The song was released internationally but failed to chart outside Australia. It was, however, influential in the history of dance music, being sampled by Jesse Saunders for the bassline of what is commonly held to be the first Chicago house music record, \""On and On\"" (1984). Dunlop and Brown also released an album as Player One, Game Over. Dunlop recalled: \""We sat down and wrote a bunch of space songs, but instead of sticking to the concept of the hit, we wandered off into the 'clever' musical genre with fancy time signatures, radical chord progressions and so on.

"The Ten [[Days]] of [[Brescia]] (Italian: Dieci giornate di [[Brescia]]) was a [[revolt]] which [[broke]] out in the northern Italian city of that name, which lasted from March 23 to April 1, 1849. In the early 19th century Brescia was part of the Austrian puppet state called Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia.

The Austrian troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily cannonaded the city, damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the revolt, when reinforcements arrived.

"Daggermouth was a Canadian pop punk/melodic hardcore [[band]] [[formed]] in 2004 in Vancouver.

"[[Oleg]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[born]] 10 [[January]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] [[chess]] [[grandmaster]] and former European [[junior]] [[champion]]. [[Many]] [[honours]] and [[awards]] were [[bestowed]] on him as a [[young]] [[man]]. [[After]] winning the European [[Junior]] Championship in 1973, he became an [[International]] [[Master]] the same year. In 1974 he was a [[member]] of the [[victorious]] USSR [[team]] at the [[World]] [[Student]] [[Team]] [[Championship]] [[held]] in Teesside, [[England]], where he [[scored]] the [[best]] [[result]] for [[board]] 4 (8/9). [[The]] [[following]] year, he [[had]] a [[terrific]] [[result]] at the [[USSR]] [[Championship]], [[sharing]] second [[place]] with Boris Gulko, [[Mikhail]] Tal and [[Rafael]] Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. In 1976, his [[Grandmaster]] [[title]] was [[ratified]]. [[He]] has an [[impressive]] collection of [[tournament]] [[victories]] [[including]] [[Odessa]] 1974, Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, [[Leningrad]] 1977 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Jurmala 1983, [[Moscow]] 1985, Reggio [[Emilia]] 1986 ([[shared]] with [[Andersson]] and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. [[Playing]] the Hungarian [[Open]] [[Championship]] at Györ in 1990 he [[enjoyed]] a most [[impressive]] [[victory]], [[finishing]] a clear 2 [[points]] [[ahead]] of the [[field]]. Second [[place]] [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after [[Karpov]]) and [[Dortmund]] 1982 (after Hort) were also [[important]] landmarks in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= [[finish]] at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays [[less]] [[active]] as a [[tournament]] [[player]], he [[has]] nevertheless [[maintained]] a [[highly]] [[competitive]] [[rating]] and is [[able]] to [[win]] smaller [[events]] on the grandmaster [[circuit]], such as Solin-Split 2004 and [[Hotel]] Petra ([[Rome]]) 2005.

[[At]] the [[European]] [[Team]] [[Chess]] [[Championships]] his medal haul [[has]] [[amounted]] to an [[incredible]] 6 gold and 1 [[silver]]. [[His]] chess [[playing]] style [[has]] been [[described]] as [[aggressive]] and this may [[be]] a [[result]] of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a [[group]] of other [[aspiring]] masters, he was first [[coached]] by [[Viktor]] [[Kart]] (an [[instructor]] of the Lviv [[Sports]] [[Academy]]) and then, as an improver, was [[assigned]] a [[senior]] [[master]] as a [[tutor]]/[[mentor]]. In his [[case]] the master was [[Mikhail]] Tal, an ex-world [[champion]] [[noted]] for his [[attacking]] chess. [[In]] respect of chess [[opening]] theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[Pawel]] Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[welding]] 10 [[Yann]] 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Armenian]] [[shortcoming]] [[shaolin]] and former European [[kids]] [[championship]].

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow [[rotator]] from the [[inner]] [[regions]] of the asteroid [[belt]], [[approximately]] 4.7 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American [[female]] [[astronomer]] [[Eleanor]] Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.[[S]]. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost [[dense]] [[concentration]] of asteroids in the [[Solar]] System. The asteroid [[orbits]] the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its [[orbit]] has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's [[observation]] arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7.

"All Saints' [[Church]] is a Church of England [[parish]] [[church]] in the town of [[Reading]] in the English county of Berkshire. The church is on Downshire Square, a tree-lined square in West Reading close to the Bath Road. It is part of the [[parish]] of St. Mark and All Saints, which includes St. Mark's Church. The [[church]] was built between 1865 and 1874, as a daughter church of the Minster Church of St Mary, to serve the growing population of the Bath Road area. It was designed by the architect James Piers St Aubyn. The construction is of coursed rubble with ashlar dressings and weathered buttresses. The roof is tiled, and the [[church]] has a five bay aisled nave with a short transept. The interior includes a painted arcade, a rich five-window apse, and mural mosaics, the finest of which is a glass mosaic reredos depicting the last supper.

The foundations for a tower to the south side of the church were constructed, but the tower itself was never completed.

"90377 Sedna is a large [[minor]] [[planet]] in the [[outer]] [[reaches]] of the [[Solar]] [[System]] that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 [[astronomical]] [[units]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[three]] times as [[far]] as [[Neptune]]. Spectroscopy has [[revealed]] that Sedna's [[surface]] composition is [[similar]] to that of some other trans-Neptunian [[objects]], being [[largely]] a [[mixture]] of [[water]], methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its [[surface]] is one of the reddest among Solar System [[objects]]. [[It]] is most [[likely]] a dwarf [[planet]]. [[For]] most of its [[orbit]], it is even [[farther]] from the Sun than at [[present]], with its aphelion [[estimated]] at 937 [[AU]] (31 [[times]] Neptune's [[distance]]), [[making]] it one of the most distant [[known]] objects in the [[Solar]] [[System]] other than long-period comets. Sedna [[has]] an [[exceptionally]] [[long]] and elongated [[orbit]], [[taking]] [[approximately]] 11,400 years to [[complete]] and a [[distant]] [[point]] of [[closest]] [[approach]] to the Sun at 76 [[AU]]. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor [[Planet]] [[Center]] currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated [[orbits]] by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current [[orbit]] by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another [[star]] [[system]]. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large [[planet]] beyond the [[orbit]] of Neptune. [[Astronomer]] Michael E.
