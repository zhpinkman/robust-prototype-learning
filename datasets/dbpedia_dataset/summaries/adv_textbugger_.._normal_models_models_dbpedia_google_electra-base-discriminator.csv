Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best [[remembered]] for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"The [[2011]] Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was [[held]] on Sunday, [[22]] May 2011, to elect the [[8th]] [[General]] Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish [[autonomous]] community of [[Asturias]]. [[At]] stake were all 45 seats in the General [[Junta]], determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the [[Spanish]] [[Socialist]] [[Workers']] [[Party]] (PSOE) had governed the [[autonomous]] [[community]] since the first election in [[1983]]. However, in the [[2011]] election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. The FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco √Ålvarez [[Cascos]], [[former]] Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as [[PP's]] candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while [[PSOE's]] collapse had been [[predicted]] in [[early]] opinion polls, the PP had been widely [[expected]] to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the [[worst]] result of its history. The [[Asturian]] Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, [[incumbent]] since 1999, did not seek re-election.

"[[Russells]] [[Hall]] Hospital is an [[NHS]] general hospital located in [[Dudley]], [[West]] Midlands, England, run by [[The]] [[Dudley]] [[Group]] NHS Foundation [[Trust]]. [[The]] hospital is situated [[south-west]] of the town centre on the A4101 road, which [[connects]] to the [[Kingswinford]] area of the borough. It was [[first]] planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding [[area]]. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry [[centre]] for the borough's [[hospitals]], and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until [[March]] 1984, becoming fully operational in May that [[year]]. The new hospital included an accident and [[emergency]] unit to replace those at the [[Guest]] [[Hospital]] in [[Dudley]] and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in [[Stourbridge]]. Around this time, the NHS [[first]] began to consider the [[closure]] of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, [[plans]] were [[unveiled]] for Russells [[Hall]] to be [[expanded]] as [[part]] of plans to close [[Wordsley]] and Dudley Guest [[hospitals]], as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital.

In April [[1998]], however, it was [[decided]] that [[Wordsley]] Hospital [[would]] close completely and Corbett and Dudley [[Guest]] would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells [[Hall]] being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in [[2004]] and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size.

"Northampton /[[n…îÀêÀàŒ∏√¶mpt…ôn]]/ is the county town of Northamptonshire in the [[East]] [[Midlands]] of [[England]]. It [[lies]] on the River [[Nene]], about 67 miles (108 km) [[north-west]] of London and 50 miles (80 km) [[south-east]] of Birmingham. One of the largest [[towns]] in the UK, [[Northampton]] had a population of 212,100 in the [[2011]] census.

During the Middle [[Ages]], the town rose to national [[significance]] with the establishment of Northampton [[Castle]], which was an occasional royal [[residence]] and regularly hosted the Parliament of [[England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the University of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town [[walls]]. [[It]] was granted its [[first]] town charter by King Richard I in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by King John in [[1215]]. The [[town]] is also the [[site]] of two medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English [[Civil]] War, which culminated in King Charles II [[ordering]] the destruction of the town [[walls]] and most of the castle. The town [[also]] suffered the Great Fire of Northampton ([[1675]]) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon [[rebuilt]] and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th [[century]]. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union Canal and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and [[leather]] manufacture. After the World Wars, Northampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a New Town in 1968, accelerating [[development]] in the town.

"[[Patoka]] [[Lake]] is the second-largest [[reservoir]] in the U.S. [[state]] of [[Indiana]] (after Lake Monroe) and is spread across Dubois, Crawford, and Orange counties in southern Indiana.

The lake is fed by several smaller tributaries including Allen Creek, Paint Creek, and Ritter [[Creek]]. [[After]] the lake was created several parks and nature preserves were established around it totaling 16,920 acres (68.5 km2). The lake and dam is still managed by a cooperative management team of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Patoka Lake is a great place for photography, as it is inhabited by migrating birds, a large variety of fish and beautiful lake [[shores]]. The lake has been heavily stocked with bass, bluegill, catfish, redear, crappie, and walleye. Once a year the Lake Association hosts GarDaze, an event bringing in avid fisherman from around the world, including fishing celebrities like Babe Winkleman and Bill Dance. Other facilities include an archery range, boat ramps, a cross-country skiing course, fishing areas (including ice fishing), a disc golf course, trails for hiking and bicycling, hunting areas, interpretive and recreational programs, star parties, picnic shelters, swimming areas, and waterskiing zones. The lake also hosts a large campground with over 500 camping sites. Patoka Lake has been very beneficial to the surrounding community and the State of Indiana.

"[[Archibald]] ([[died]] 1298) was a [[13th-century]] [[Scottish]] prelate [[best]] [[known]] for involvement in a dispute with the [[Pope]]. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the [[de]] [[Douglas]] or [[de]] Moravia families [[either]] by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this.

In that year he was consecrated as the successor of [[Simon]] de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of [[Moray]]. Through what appears to have been a [[misunderstanding]], Bishop Archibald [[confirmed]] the election of one Andrew [[de]] Dunn as Dean of [[Moray]]. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own [[candidate]], [[Nicholas]] de [[Hedon]], based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which [[Hedon]] emerged victorious.

A [[provincial]] council at [[Perth]] in [[1273]], however, exempted the [[Bishop]] of Moray as [[well]] as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in 1290.

In March 2005, a [[rotational]] light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7¬±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-).

The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979‚Äì1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92‚Äì87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the league. The team finished the 1978‚Äì79 season with a record of 11 wins and 23 losses, placing them in fourth and last place in the Midwest Division. In the Midwestern Division for the 1979‚Äì80 season, the Does finished with a record of 11 wins and 24 losses.

Saying that he hadn't been paid any of his $45,000 salary since December, Costello left the team on February 6, 1980, and was replaced by Julia Yeater, the team's assistant coach, on an interim basis.","[[Th–µ]] [[Milwa’Ωkee]] Does were a [[t–µam]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball [[Le…ëgue]].

"[[90377]] Sedna is a large minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a [[distance]] of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as [[far]] as Neptune. Spectroscopy has [[revealed]] that Sedna's surface composition is similar to that of some other trans-Neptunian [[objects]], being largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. [[Its]] [[surface]] is one of the reddest among Solar System objects. It is most likely a dwarf planet. For most of its [[orbit]], it is even farther from the Sun than at present, with its [[aphelion]] estimated at 937 AU (31 times Neptune's distance), making it one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets. Sedna has an exceptionally [[long]] and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 [[years]] to complete and a distant [[point]] of closest approach to the Sun at 76 AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been [[tugged]] into its current [[orbit]] by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was [[captured]] from another [[star]] system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit [[may]] be evidence for a large planet [[beyond]] the orbit of Neptune. [[Astronomer]] Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and the dwarf planets Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, thinks that it is the most scientifically important trans-Neptunian [[object]] found to date, because [[understanding]] its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the [[origin]] and early [[evolution]] of the Solar [[System]].","[[9037ùüï]] Sedna is a large minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a [[distanœ≤e]] of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as [[f]] [[ar]] as Neptune.

The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 [[million]] albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), [[Ron]] \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and [[Bill]] Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including [[Mother]] McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in [[1973]], and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its [[entire]] [[30-year]] history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968‚Äì1970), [[Keith]] Godchaux (keyboards; 1971‚Äì1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972‚Äì1979), [[Brent]] Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979‚Äì1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990‚Äì1995).

The band was [[ranekd]] 57th by [[R–ælling]] [[Ston–µ]] magazine in its The [[Gr–µatest]] Artists of all [[TiÔΩçe]] issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their [[Barùöùon]] Hall Concert at Cornell University ([[M]] [[ay]] 8, 1977) was added to the National [[Recordnig]] Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 [[millon]] albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), [[R–æn]] \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and [[Bil‚Öº]] Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including [[Mothe‚≤Ö]] McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in [[l973]], and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its [[–µntire]] [[3O-year]] history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968‚Äì1970), [[Keiùöùh]] Godchaux (keyboards; 1971‚Äì1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972‚Äì1979), [[Brenùöù]] Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979‚Äì1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990‚Äì1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts.

"Ascomycota is a [[division]] or [[phylum]] of the [[kingdom]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, [[form]] the [[subkingdom]] [[Dikarya]]. Its members are [[commonly]] known as the [[sac]] fungi or ascomycetes. They are the [[largest]] phylum of Fungi, with over [[64]],000 [[species]]. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] [[group]] is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: [[·ºÄœÉŒ∫œåœÇ]] (askos), [[meaning]] \""sac\"" or \""[[wineskin]]\""), a [[microscopic]] sexual structure in which [[nonmotile]] spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[species]] of the [[Ascomycota]] are asexual, [[meaning]] that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not [[form]] asci or ascospores. [[Previously]] [[placed]] in the [[Deuteromycota]] along with [[asexual]] [[species]] from other fungal [[taxa]], [[asexual]] (or [[anamorphic]]) ascomycetes are now identified and [[classified]] based on [[morphological]] or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] [[analyses]] of DNA [[sequences]]. The ascomycetes are a [[monophyletic]] group, i.e. it contains all [[descendants]] of one common ancestor. [[This]] [[group]] is of particular relevance to humans as [[sources]] for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and [[plants]]. Familiar examples of sac fungi include [[morels]], [[truffles]], brewer's yeast and [[baker's]] yeast, dead [[man's]] [[fingers]], and cup fungi. [[The]] fungal symbionts in the [[majority]] of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are [[many]] [[plant-pathogenic]] [[ascomycetes]], including [[apple]] scab, [[rice]] blast, the [[ergot]] fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews. [[Several]] species of ascomycetes are biological [[model]] organisms in laboratory research. Most famously, [[Neurospora]] [[crassa]], several species of yeasts, and Aspergillus species are used in [[many]] genetics and cell biology studies.

He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues [[jam]] [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Ni·∏´riya was the culminating point of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also [[known]] as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] [[rail]] [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that [[time]]. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New [[York]]. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in [[continual]] operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January [[1979]] and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

"[[Dolomedes]] /d…íl…ôÀàmiÀêdiÀêz/ is a [[genus]] of large spiders of the [[family]] [[Pisauridae]]. [[They]] are [[also]] [[known]] as [[fishing]] spiders, raft [[spiders]], [[dock]] spiders or [[wharf]] spiders. Almost all Dolomedes [[species]] are semi-aquatic, with the exception of the [[tree-dwelling]] D. [[albineus]] of the [[southwestern]] [[United]] [[States]]. [[Many]] species have a [[striking]] pale stripe down each side of the [[body]]. They [[hunt]] by waiting at the [[edge]] of a [[pool]] or stream, then when they detect the ripples from [[prey]], they run across the surface to [[subdue]] it [[using]] their foremost [[legs]], which are [[tipped]] with small claws; [[like]] other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow [[jaws]] to kill and [[digest]] the prey.

"[[The]] men's [[single]] [[sculls]] competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[took]] [[place]] at the [[Sydney]] [[International]] [[Regatta]] Centre. This rowing [[event]] is a single [[scull]] event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a [[single]] rower. The \""scull\"" [[portion]] means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final. Placing in the repechages determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.

"Ellis [[Edgar]] \""Puss\"" [[Achong]] (16 February [[1904]] ‚Äì 29 August [[1986]]) was a sportsman from Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies. He [[played]] cricket for the [[West]] Indies and was the [[first]] [[person]] of known [[Chinese]] descent to [[play]] in a Test match. Left-arm unorthodox [[spin]] (left-arm wrist spin) is sometimes [[known]] as \""slow [[left-arm]] chinaman\"" ([[SLC]]) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was [[born]] in Belmont, Port of Spain. He played football as a left-winger for a local [[team]], Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from [[1919]] to 1932. [[Achong]] is better [[known]] for [[playing]] cricket. He was mainly a bowler. [[His]] stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm [[spin]]. [[After]] bowling this variation to have Walter [[Robins]] stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire [[Joe]] Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody [[Chinaman]]\"". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery ([[spinning]] from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""[[chinaman]]\"" as a result. [[However]], [[Achong]] was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm [[spin]] ‚Äì that is believed to be Charles [[Llewellyn]] of South Africa. Achong [[played]] in six Test matches for the West Indies against the [[English]] [[cricket]] [[team]] from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, [[Achong]] [[took]] eight Test [[wickets]] at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929‚Äì30 and [[1934]]‚Äì[[35]]. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of [[1931]]‚Äì32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. [[He]] married during the 1933 tour of [[England]] and settled in Manchester. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.
