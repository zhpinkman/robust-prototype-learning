"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club [[faced]] Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

"(148209) 2000 CR105, also written as (148209) 2000 CR105, is the tenth-most-distant known [[object]] in the Solar System as of 2015.

"The Milwaukee [[Does]] were a team in the short-lived Women's Professional [[Basketball]] [[League]]. [[Based]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three [[seasons]], 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan [[mercenaries]] under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the [[spring]] and summer of the same year.

The [[defining]] feature of this fungal group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), [[meaning]] \""[[sac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a [[microscopic]] [[sexual]] [[structure]] in which nonmotile spores, [[called]] ascospores, are formed. [[However]], some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, [[meaning]] that they do not have a [[sexual]] [[cycle]] and thus do not [[form]] asci or ascospores. Previously [[placed]] in the Deuteromycota along with asexual [[species]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and [[classified]] based on [[morphological]] or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] [[analyses]] of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic [[group]], i.e. it [[contains]] all [[descendants]] of [[one]] [[common]] ancestor. This [[group]] is of [[particular]] relevance to [[humans]] as [[sources]] for medicinally [[important]] compounds, such as antibiotics and for [[making]] [[bread]], [[alcoholic]] beverages, and cheese, but [[also]] as pathogens of [[humans]] and [[plants]].

The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice [[blast]], the ergot fungi, [[black]] [[knot]], and the [[powdery]] [[mildews]]. [[Several]] [[species]] of ascomycetes are biological [[model]] organisms in laboratory research. Most famously, Neurospora crassa, [[several]] [[species]] of yeasts, and Aspergillus [[species]] are used in many genetics and cell biology [[studies]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[business]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office.

"Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] [[pass]] in the Jura Mountains in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It connects Sonceboz and Tavannes. The name of the pass comes from the Latin: Petra pertusa, meaning broken rock. The pass road has been dated to the second half of the 1st century AD. A 159 by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the road lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony Aventicum, as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. It probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky gate leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern Avenches)-Salodurum (modern Solothurn)-Augusta Raurica road with the Vesontio (modern Besançon)-Epomanduodurum (modern Mandeure)-Kembs road. The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant Reformation. The first modern road was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel. This road linked the cities of Basel and Biel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the pass became part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the surrounding area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Bern widened part of the pass road in a section between Bözingen (now part of Biel) and Courtelary. In 1874 a railway tunnel was completed through the pass which linked Sonceboz-Tavannes. The first road that was passable for automobiles was built during World War I by the corps of engineers of the Swiss Army. In 1932, a new road was built employing the jobless due to the Great Depression. In November 1997, a 2100-meter-long tunnel was opened for the A-16 Autobahn.","Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mint]] [[fleet]] in the Jura Mountains in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

"Ethno Jazz, a [[form]] of Ethno Music, is sometimes equaled to World Music or is regarded as its successor, particularly before the 1990s. An independent meaning of \""Ethno Jazz\"" emerged around 1990 with globalisation and later the Internet as well as the commercial success of Ethno groups and musicians. From the American and European view, interpretations from developing countries, particularly the developing southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China, became important. Whereas global regions like India, Latin America and Africa had been reached already before 1990, they regained importance in the form of Ethno Music, and Ethno Jazz in particular. Notable examples are the emergence of jazz through the interaction between New Orleans and Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz in the 1940s and 1950s, Arab influence in Jazz in the 1950s and 1960s and Indian influence through The Beatles and Rock Jazz of the 1960s and 1970s. Ethno Jazz, particularly from the 1990s, meant Jazz was in accordance with the more American and European view, but realised with the typical musical differences of non-American and -European regions, particularly the expanding centres of Southeast Asia and China. Superficially, and out of an American and European view, Ethno Jazz is sometimes not as Jazz, but probably something similar missing a more suitable classification. During the 1990s, after the end of the long-time Cold War between east and west, there was a global enthusiasm about the development of Ethno-Musik, especially Ethno Jazz. The rapidly growing megacities (over 10 million inhabitants, like Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Jakarta, Bombay, São Paulo, Mexico City) further promoted substantial urbanisation based development of Ethno Jazz.","Ethno Jazz, a [[imprint]] of Ethno Music, is sometimes equaled to World Music or is regarded as its successor, particularly before the 1990s. An independent meaning of \""Ethno Jazz\"" emerged around 1990 with globalisation and later the Internet as well as the commercial success of Ethno groups and musicians. From the American and European view, interpretations from developing countries, particularly the developing southeast Asia and the People's Republic of China, became important. Whereas global regions like India, Latin America and Africa had been reached already before 1990, they regained importance in the form of Ethno Music, and Ethno Jazz in particular. Notable examples are the emergence of jazz through the interaction between New Orleans and Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz in the 1940s and 1950s, Arab influence in Jazz in the 1950s and 1960s and Indian influence through The Beatles and Rock Jazz of the 1960s and 1970s. Ethno Jazz, particularly from the 1990s, meant Jazz was in accordance with the more American and European view, but realised with the typical musical differences of non-American and -European regions, particularly the expanding centres of Southeast Asia and China. Superficially, and out of an American and European view, Ethno Jazz is sometimes not as Jazz, but probably something similar missing a more suitable classification. During the 1990s, after the end of the long-time Cold War between east and west, there was a global enthusiasm about the development of Ethno-Musik, especially Ethno Jazz.
