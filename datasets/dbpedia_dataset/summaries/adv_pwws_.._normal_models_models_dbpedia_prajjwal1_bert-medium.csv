"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group.

The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the [[grave]] of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is [[defend]] by a [[humble]] permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the [[fort]] numbered 15 men in total. [[be]] the [[incidental]], the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",5

"Sir [[Matthew]] Hale SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, [[judge]] and [[lawyer]] most [[noted]] for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The [[History]] of the [[Pleas]] of the [[Crown]]. [[Born]] to a barrister and his wife, who had both [[died]] by the [[time]] he was [[5]], [[Hale]] was [[raised]] by his father's relative, a [[strict]] Puritan, and [[inherited]] his faith.

On 8 November 1628 he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was [[called]] to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] 1636. As a barrister, Hale [[represented]] a [[variety]] of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been [[hypothesised]] that Hale was to [[represent]] Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality [[saved]] him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale [[Commission]], which investigated law reform. [[Following]] the Commission's [[dissolution]], Oliver Cromwell [[made]] him a [[Justice]] of the [[Common]] [[Pleas]].

"The [[SM]] Kirov [[Stadium]] was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was [[one]] of the [[largest]] [[stadiums]] anywhere in the world. The [[stadium]] was [[named]] after Sergey Kirov. The [[stands]] of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial [[mound]] in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The [[stadium]] was [[open]] on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was [[reduced]] to 72,000. [[In]] 1994 the [[stadium]] was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 [[Goodwill]] Games. This was the [[last]] major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the [[stadium]] was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit [[Stadium]] was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football [[club]] in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a [[match]] against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of [[planned]] deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium.

Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The [[bowl]] was [[out-of-doors]] on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football.
