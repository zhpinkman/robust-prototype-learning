"On 20 October [[1990]], Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a [[brawl]] between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat.

"[[Oleg]] [[Mikhailovich]] [[Romanishin]] ([[born]] 10 [[January]] [[1952]] in [[Lviv]]) is a Ukrainian [[chess]] [[grandmaster]] and [[former]] European junior [[champion]]. Many [[honours]] and awards were [[bestowed]] on him as a young [[man]]. After winning the European Junior Championship in [[1973]], he [[became]] an [[International]] [[Master]] the same [[year]]. In [[1974]] he was a [[member]] of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team [[Championship]] held in [[Teesside]], England, where he [[scored]] the best [[result]] for board 4 (8/9). The [[following]] [[year]], he had a [[terrific]] result at the USSR Championship, sharing second [[place]] with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael [[Vaganian]], after Tigran Petrosian. In [[1976]], his [[Grandmaster]] [[title]] was [[ratified]]. He has an impressive collection of [[tournament]] [[victories]] including Odessa [[1974]], Novi [[Sad]] 1975, Yerevan [[1976]], Hastings [[1976]]/[[77]], Leningrad [[1977]] ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Gausdal [[1979]], Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv [[1981]] ([[shared]] with [[Tal]]), Jurmala [[1983]], Moscow [[1985]], Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojeviƒá) and [[Debrecen]] 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open [[Championship]] at Gy√∂r in [[1990]] he enjoyed a most impressive [[victory]], [[finishing]] a [[clear]] 2 [[points]] ahead of the field. Second [[place]] [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund [[1982]] (after [[Hort]]) were also important [[landmarks]] in his [[career]], as was his [[3rd]]= [[finish]] at Sochi in [[1982]]. Nowadays [[less]] [[active]] as a tournament [[player]], he has [[nevertheless]] [[maintained]] a highly [[competitive]] [[rating]] and is able to win [[smaller]] events on the [[grandmaster]] [[circuit]], such as Solin-Split [[2004]] and Hotel [[Petra]] ([[Rome]]) [[2005]]. At the [[Olympiads]] he represented the Soviet Union in [[1978]] and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, [[winning]] a [[total]] of [[2]] [[silver]] medals and 2 [[bronze]]. At the [[European]] Team Chess [[Championships]] his [[medal]] [[haul]] has amounted to an [[incredible]] [[6]] [[gold]] and 1 [[silver]]. His chess [[playing]] [[style]] has been described as aggressive and this [[may]] be a [[result]] of the [[coaching]] he received as a [[junior]]. Along with a group of other [[aspiring]] [[masters]], he was [[first]] [[coached]] by Viktor [[Kart]] (an instructor of the [[Lviv]] [[Sports]] Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his [[case]] the [[master]] was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. [[In]] respect of [[chess]] [[opening]] theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long [[since]] discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the [[full]] point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[Oelg]] [[Mikhailoviœ≤h]] [[Romani—ïhin]] ([[bron]] 10 [[Janua‚≤Öy]] [[195·íø]] in [[Lvv]]) is a Ukrainian [[ches—ï]] [[garndmaster]] and [[fromer]] European junior [[chaÔΩçpion]].

"[[Archibald]] ([[died]] [[1298]]) was a 13th-century [[Scottish]] prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the [[Pope]].

However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. [[There]] was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a [[state]] of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, [[Pennsylvania]], United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue [[Weirback]]. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their [[brews]] are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the [[IPA]] style. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher [[released]] a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget [[hops]] grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

"90377 Sedna is a [[large]] minor [[planet]] in the outer reaches of the [[Solar]] [[System]] that was, as of [[2015]], at a distance of about [[86]] [[astronomical]] [[units]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[three]] [[times]] as [[far]] as [[Neptune]]. [[Spectroscopy]] has [[revealed]] that Sedna's [[surface]] composition is [[similar]] to that of some other trans-Neptunian [[objects]], being [[largely]] a [[mixture]] of [[water]], [[methane]], and nitrogen [[ices]] with tholins. Its surface is [[one]] of the [[reddest]] among Solar System objects. It is most likely a dwarf [[planet]]. [[For]] most of its [[orbit]], it is even [[farther]] from the Sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at [[937]] AU (31 [[times]] [[Neptune's]] [[distance]]), [[making]] it one of the most [[distant]] known [[objects]] in the Solar [[System]] other than long-period [[comets]]. [[Sedna]] has an exceptionally long and elongated [[orbit]], [[taking]] [[approximately]] 11,[[400]] years to complete and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at [[76]] AU. These facts have led to [[much]] speculation about its [[origin]]. The Minor [[Planet]] [[Center]] [[currently]] places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of [[objects]] sent into highly elongated orbits by the [[gravitational]] influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna [[never]] [[comes]] [[close]] enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner [[Oort]] cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a [[passing]] star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth [[cluster]] (an open [[cluster]]), or even that it was [[captured]] from [[another]] [[star]] system. [[Another]] hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet [[beyond]] the orbit of Neptune. [[Astronomer]] Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and the dwarf [[planets]] Eris, [[Haumea]], and Makemake, thinks that it is the most scientifically important trans-Neptunian [[object]] found to [[date]], because understanding its [[unusual]] orbit is likely to [[yield]] valuable information about the [[origin]] and early evolution of the Solar System.","90377 Sedna is a [[la‚≤Öge]] minor [[plant]] in the outer reaches of the [[Soar]] [[SysteÔΩç]] that was, as of [[201∆º]], at a distance of about [[»¢6]] [[astronomica‚Öº]] [[unit—ï]] (AU) from the Sun, about [[th‚≤Öee]] [[time—ï]] as [[fa‚≤Ö]] as [[Nepùöùune]].

The Minor [[Planeùöù]] [[Ce’∏ter]] [[current‚Öºy]] places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of [[object—ï]] sent into highly elongated orbits by the [[gravitationa‚Öº]] influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna [[nev–µr]] [[come—ï]] [[clo—ïe]] enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner [[Orot]] cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a [[pass]] [[ing]] star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth [[cluter]] (an open [[cluste‚≤Ö]]), or even that it was [[capture‘Å]] from [[anothe‚≤Ö]] [[sta‚≤Ö]] system. [[Anothe‚≤Ö]] hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet [[b–µyond]] the orbit of Neptune. [[Astronome‚≤Ö]] Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and the dwarf [[plantes]] Eris, [[HauÔΩçea]], and Makemake, thinks that it is the most scientifically important trans-Neptunian [[objecùöù]] found to [[dtae]], because understanding its [[’Ωnusual]] orbit is likely to [[yiled]] valuable information about the [[o‚≤Öigin]] and early evolution of the Solar System.",2

The Arkansas RiverBlades was an expansion franchise that [[entered]] the East Coast [[Hockey]] League for the 1999‚Äì2000 season. [[Their]] home games were played at the newly opened ALLTEL Arena. The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The [[ECHL]] franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the [[team]] to finally agree to a name change. In [[October]] 1998, a contest was held to [[establish]] a new name and \""[[RiverBlades]]\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's [[minor]] league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is [[similar]] to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season.

[[The]] [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old [[high]] [[school]] boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always [[come]] true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his [[dream]]. From that [[day]] forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he [[enters]] high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone [[else]]) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of [[Ni·∏´riya]] was the [[culminating]] [[point]] of the hostilities between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in May 2012, some Syrian opposition fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation. Turkey maintains a small enclave within Syria itself, the [[T–æmb]] of Suleyman Shah on the right bank of the Euphrates in Aleppo Province, near the village of Qarah Qawzak (Karakozak). The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. [[Followi’∏g]] the [[i’∏cident]], the [[T’Ωrkish]] government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while [[t’∞en-Prime]] [[M—ñnister]] [[Er]] [[doƒüan]] warned that \""the [[t–æmb]] of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory. Any act of aggression against it would be an attack on our territory and NATO territory.\"" Analysts have cited the tomb as a potential future flashpoint in Turkish-Syrian relations.",5

"The [[Taradale]] Viaduct is a [[large]] wrought iron box girder [[bridge]] over [[Back]] [[Creek]] at [[Taradale]], [[Victoria]] on the [[Bendigo]] [[Railway]] in [[Victoria]] [[Australia]].

[[Construction]] of the Bendigo [[line]] [[commenced]] under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray [[River]] [[Railway]] Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with [[financial]] difficulties when it was [[unable]] to [[raise]] sufficient funds, and was bought out by the [[Victorian]] colonial government in [[1860]] when it formed the Victorian Railways [[Department]]. The [[design]] work was then taken over by Captain [[Andrew]] [[Clarke]], R.

"The Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system.

"[[The]] [[Scottish]] [[Review]] of Books is a [[quarterly]] literary [[magazine]] [[published]] in [[Scotland]]. It was established in October [[2004]] with the support of the Scottish Arts [[Council]]. In 2009 it became a [[limited]] company with a [[board]] of directors, Scottish Review of Books Limited. [[It]] has published articles by many distinguished contributors and commentators. The [[Review]] has been highly [[successful]] since its launch and now has a circulation of around 320,000 copies per year. The [[magazine]] is inserted free of charge in The [[Herald]] newspaper and is also available by subscription in print or online and in schools, museums, libraries, book festivals and bookshops across Scotland. The tie-in with The Herald has been of considerable benefit in improving its reach; Carla Sassi of the University of Verona comments that \""the Scottish Review of Books... probably reaches a larger reading public than any specialised literary journal or magazine did in the past.\"" According to the editor, Alan Taylor, \""our aim ... is to get people talking about issues surrounding Scottish literature and to challenge people‚Äôs perceptions about particular subjects. At a time when Edinburgh has been recognised by UNESCO as the first World City of Literature and when Scotland‚Äôs writers are receiving both critical and popular acclaim, a magazine such as this is a timely and much needed addition to the literature landscape in Scotland.\"" It was established to provide a smaller-scale Scottish equivalent of the London Review of Books, on which it is closely modelled in name and appearance. Unlike the LRB, which covers world literature, the SRB [[deals]] only with Scottish books. The impetus for its establishment came from a Review of Scottish Publishing issued by the Scottish Arts Council in 2004. The [[review]], [[carried]] out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Napier University on [[behalf]] of the SAC, [[recommended]] the creation of a new magazine to promote Scottish books as part of a wider effort to boost Scottish book publishing. The launch of the Scottish Review of Books was underwritten by two publishers, Derek Rodger of Argyll Publishing, and Hugh Andrew of Birlinn and Polygon with the aid of [[grants]] from the SAC.

It was established in October [[204]] with the support of the Scottish Arts [[Concil]]. In 2009 it became a [[liÔΩçited]] company with a [[boar‘Å]] of directors, Scottish Review of Books Limited. [[Iùöù]] has published articles by many distinguished contributors and commentators. The [[Reviw]] has been highly [[successfu‚Öº]] since its launch and now has a circulation of around 320,000 copies per year. The [[magaine]] is inserted free of charge in The [[Hreald]] newspaper and is also available by subscription in print or online and in schools, museums, libraries, book festivals and bookshops across Scotland. The tie-in with The Herald has been of considerable benefit in improving its reach; Carla Sassi of the University of Verona comments that \""the Scottish Review of Books... probably reaches a larger reading public than any specialised literary journal or magazine did in the past.\"" According to the editor, Alan Taylor, \""our aim ... is to get people talking about issues surrounding Scottish literature and to challenge people‚Äôs perceptions about particular subjects. At a time when Edinburgh has been recognised by UNESCO as the first World City of Literature and when Scotland‚Äôs writers are receiving both critical and popular acclaim, a magazine such as this is a timely and much needed addition to the literature landscape in Scotland.\"" It was established to provide a smaller-scale Scottish equivalent of the London Review of Books, on which it is closely modelled in name and appearance. Unlike the LRB, which covers world literature, the SRB [[deal—ï]] only with Scottish books. The impetus for its establishment came from a Review of Scottish Publishing issued by the Scottish Arts Council in 2004. The [[r–µview]], [[carreid]] out by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Napier University on [[behlaf]] of the SAC, [[r–µcommended]] the creation of a new magazine to promote Scottish books as part of a wider effort to boost Scottish book publishing. The launch of the Scottish Review of Books was underwritten by two publishers, Derek Rodger of Argyll Publishing, and Hugh Andrew of Birlinn and Polygon with the aid of [[grant—ï]] from the SAC.

"Dick de Groot (born [[1920]]) was [[born]] in Scheveningen, a beach suburb of The Hague in the Netherlands. After the usual schooling that prepared him for the business world he decided to follow his old dream of being a painter. He studied five years at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and took post-graduate classes in sculpture. In 1959 de Groot came to America with his wife Hans and five children. He started painting gigantic faces, foaming glasses of beer and entire scenes up to eighty feet (24 m) long, for the advertising industry. A good year of this was enough and Dick went on his own, doing murals, portraits in oils or bronze, always on commission. A long period of involvement in [[business]] followed and he kept painting in spare time, without the pressure of having to make a living at it. Now, in retirement he can do as he pleases and describes his work as follows: I refuse to paint \""sure sellers\"", such as the cute, the corny, the romantic, the sentimental, the narrative. My favorite subject is the contemporary American urban scene, which I find exciting and uniquely suited to my taste.

On 6 [[Ju‚Öºy]] 2006 Zenit decided to play a [[matœ≤h]] against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of [[unavailabiliùöùy]] of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the [[currenùöù]] Zenit ground. Part of the [[seat—ï]] were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September [[2]] [[006]]. A new stadium (see New Zenit Stadium) is under construction, tentatively scheduled to open in 2016.",2

"The Basque [[conflict]], also [[known]] as the [[Spain]]‚Äì[[ETA]] [[conflict]], was an [[armed]] and [[political]] [[conflict]] between Spain and the Basque National Liberation [[Movement]], a group of social and political Basque organizations which [[sought]] independence from Spain and France. The movement was built around the separatist organization ETA which since 1959 launched a campaign of attacks against Spanish administrations. In response, ETA was proscribed as a terrorist organization by the Spanish, British, French and American [[authorities]]. The [[conflict]] took place mostly on Spanish soil, although to a smaller degree it was also present in France, which was primarily used as a safe haven by ETA members. It was the longest running violent conflict in modern [[Western]] Europe. It has been sometimes referred to as \""Europe's [[longest]] war\"". The terminology is controversial. \""Basque conflict\"" is preferred by Basque nationalist groups, including those opposed to ETA violence. Spanish public opinion generally rejects the term, seeing it as legitimate state agencies fighting a terrorist group. The [[conflict]] has both political and military [[dimensions]]. Its participants include politicians and political activists on both sides, the abertzale left and the Spanish government, and the security forces of Spain and France fighting against ETA and other small organizations, usually involved in the kale borroka.

Virginia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in its inaugural year in the conference, running off a streak of eight straight wins to end the regular season after a 2‚Äì2 start.

Tech lost to eventual BCS National Champion USC at [[FedEx]] Field in [[Landover]], Maryland, 24-13, losing the lead late in the third quarter. After a 63-0 shellacking of Western Michigan, Tech played its first ever ACC game on September 18, against Duke. Tech prevailed 41-17 in Lane Stadium.

After reeling off three-straight wins, including a 19-13 [[squeaker]] over then #7 West Virginia, the [[Hokies']] fortunes looked bleak in the fourth quarter of their game against Georgia Tech in Atlanta on ESPN Thursday night college football.

"Belfast Central [[Library]] is a public [[library]] in Royal Avenue, Belfast, Northern Ireland. Opened in 1888, it was one of the first major public library buildings in Ireland. A competition for the design of the building was won by architect W H Lynn in 1883 and it was built by H & J Martin builders. Designed to reflect the ambitions of the growing city of Belfast, its architecture is a fine example of a public building at the height of the Victorian age. On a black granite base, the Dumfries red sandstone exterior with a slightly Italianate feel, houses a three-floor interior with a sweeping staircase, a pillared foyer, and a fine domed first-floor reading room. The top floor originally included a museum and art gallery. The building is a notable part of the 19th-century cityscape of modern Belfast. It survived undamaged through the Belfast Blitz of World War II and the Troubles of the late 20th century. The library is located in the library and Cathedral Quarter, on the edge of Belfast City Centre and close to the Belfast Campus of the University of Ulster.

"Nikolas Cassadine is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from [[General]] [[Hospital]], an American soap opera on the ABC network. Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately [[replaced]] by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a recurring basis in honor of the [[soaps']] fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular. Actor Nick Stabile took claim of the role in June 2016 in Christopher's absence. Created by head-writers Robert Guza, Jr. and Karen Harris and introduced by executive producer Wendy Riche in 1996 as the illegitimate son of Laura Spencer, the character was immediately popular with audiences. Hailed by [[Soap]] Opera Digest as the \""Best New Male Character\"" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the supercouple of Luke and Laura's happy life with their children, Lucky and Lulu.

"The Newcastle [[Jets]] 2010‚Äì11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] since the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miliƒçeviƒá to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10. The club has a new sponsor with Hunter Medical Research Institute. The Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department.

"[[The]] Fornebu Line ([[Norwegian]]: [[Fornebubanen]]) is a [[proposed]] rail [[line]] which [[would]] serve the [[peninsula]] of [[Fornebu]] in [[B√¶rum]], [[Norway]]. [[The]] [[line]] is in the [[planning]] stages and the [[transit]] agency Ruter is working [[towards]] connecting it to the [[Oslo]] Metro. [[The]] [[line]] has at various stages been proposed as a [[automated]] people mover, [[tram-train]], tramway, light [[rail]], [[stadtbahn]], [[rapid]] transit, [[bus]] rapid transit and commuter rail. The current [[proposal]] consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 [[meters]] (26,740 [[ft]]).

"[[The]] [[Algiers]] [[putsch]] (French: Putsch d'Alger or [[Coup]] d'√âtat d'Alger), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des g√©n√©raux), was a [[failed]] [[coup]] [[d'√©tat]] to overthrow French President Charles de Gaulle and establish a military junta. [[Organised]] in French Algeria by retired French army generals Maurice Challe (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), Edmond Jouhaud (former Inspector General of the French Air Force), Andr√© Zeller (former Chief of staff of the French Ground Army) and Raoul Salan (former commander-in-chief in French Algeria), it [[took]] [[place]] from the afternoon of 21 April to 26 April 1961 in the midst of the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962). [[The]] organisers of the putsch were opposed to the secret negotiations that French Prime Minister Michel Debr√©'s government had started with the anti-colonialist National Liberation Front (FLN). General Raoul Salan stated that he joined the coup without concerning himself with its technical planning; however, it has always been considered a four-man coup d'√©tat, or as de Gaulle famously put it, \""un quarteron de g√©n√©raux en retraite\"" (a handful of retired generals / generals in retreat). The coup was to come in two phases: an assertion of control in French Algeria's major cities Algiers, Oran and Constantine, followed by the seizure of Paris. The metropolitan operation would be led by Colonel Antoine Argoud, with French paratroopers descending on strategic airfields. The commanders in Oran and Constantine, however, refused to follow Challe's demand that they join the coup. At the same time, information about the metropolitan phase came to Prime Minister Debr√©'s attention through the intelligence service. On 22 April, all flights and landings were forbidden in Parisian airfields, and an order was given to the army to resist the coup \""by all means\"". The following day, President Charles de Gaulle made a famous speech on television, dressed with his 1940s general's uniform (he was 70 years old and long retired from the army) ordering the French people and army to help him.","[[Th–µ]] [[Algires]] [[putsc’∞]] (French: Putsch d'Alger or [[Co’Ωp]] d'√âtat d'Alger), also known as the Generals' putsch (Putsch des g√©n√©raux), was a [[faile‘Å]] [[co’Ωp]] [[d'√©t…ët]] to overthrow French President Charles de Gaulle and establish a military junta.

"The Republicans (German: Die Republikaner, REP) is a national conservative political [[party]] in Germany. The primary plank of the program is opposition to immigration.

[[He]] debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 30 November 2007.

During the early years of Home and Away, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) often spoke of an imaginary friend she called \""Milco\"". When Ritchie announced her departure from the soap, producers decided to introduce the real Milco, as regular character Miles Copeland. The development was described by the media as a \""legacy storyline.\"" Quong Tart announced his departure from Home and Away in October 2011. Miles departed on 23 November 2011. Miles is characterised as being charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and crumpled shirts, with his long hair, this gives him a trademark \""beachy\"" look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits. Miles' storylines have often centred on his friendships and romantic relationships with other characters. He has become a surrogate father to several teenagers, including Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Melody Jones (Celeste Dodwell). Miles and Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) had a long relationship together, during which they lost an unborn child. Kirsty eventually left town, ending their relationship. After sharing a long friendship, Miles and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) entered into a romantic relationship in 2011. Leah becomes pregnant and Miles proposes to her.

"[[William]] [[Froude]] (/[[ÀàfruÀêd]]/; 28 November 1810 in Devon ‚Äì 4 [[May]] [[1879]] in [[Simonstown]], South Africa) was an English [[engineer]], hydrodynamicist and [[naval]] [[architect]]. [[He]] was the [[first]] to formulate reliable [[laws]] for the [[resistance]] that water offers to [[ships]] (such as the [[hull]] [[speed]] equation) and for predicting their [[stability]]. [[Froude]] was born at [[Dartington]], Devon, England, the son of Robert Froude, Archdeacon of [[Totnes]] and was educated at Westminster School and [[Oriel]] College, Oxford, graduating with a [[first]] in mathematics in 1832. His [[first]] employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which, in 1837, led to Brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical [[method]] of [[setting]] out [[track]] transition curves and [[introduced]] [[analternative]] design to the [[helicoidal]] [[skew]] arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley [[Bridge]] Junction, near Exeter. At [[Brunel's]] [[invitation]] Froude [[turned]] his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of [[Naval]] [[Architects]] became influential in [[ship]] design. [[This]] led to a [[commission]] to identify the most [[efficient]] hull shape, which he was able to fulfil by [[reference]] to scale models: he established a [[formula]] (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of [[small-scale]] tests could be used to predict the behaviour of [[full-sized]] [[hulls]]. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the [[picture]]) 12 [[foot]] scale [[models]] and used them in towing [[trials]] to establish resistance and scaling [[laws]]; Raven's sharp [[prow]] followed the \""waveline\"" theory of [[John]] Scott Russell, but [[Swan's]] [[blunter]] profile proved to [[offer]] lower resistance. His experiments were vindicated in [[full-scale]] trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a [[result]] the first ship test [[tank]] was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to combine mathematical [[expertise]] with practical experimentation to such good effect that his [[methods]] are [[still]] followed today. In 1877, he was commissioned by the Admiralty to produce a machine [[capable]] of absorbing and measuring the [[power]] of large naval engines. He invented and [[built]] the world's first [[water]] [[brake]] dynamometer, sometimes known as the [[hydraulic]] [[dynamometer]], which led to the formation of [[Heenan]] & [[Froude]] Ltd in Birmingham.

"[[McKeon]] [[Pavilion]] is a [[3]],500 seat multi-purpose [[arena]] at Saint [[Mary's]] College of California in Moraga, California. Home men's and women's basketball and volleyball games are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project. With gym renovations years away, the college has made several upgrades to the facility. Prior to the 2005-2006 season new floors were installed. Before the 2006-2007 season, the lower level reserved seating (directly behind the benches) was changed from bleachers to stadium-style seats with backs. The bleachers in the student section (also known as Gaelforce) - opposite the benches - were painted dark blue. Large banners were hung from the railings separating the upper and lower seating sections, reading \""Saint Mary's College\"" behind the reserved seating and \""Gaelforce\"" behind the student section. More recently, the student section has been filled with Australian flags, reflecting the prevalence of Australians on the Gaels squad, including former star Patty Mills. In recent memory, the gym has seen the 2001 women's basketball team and the 2005 men's basketball team reach the NCAA Tournament. The women's volleyball team has also achieved much success, reaching the post-season in 2004-2006. During the 2004-2005 season the men's basketball team posted a 15-1 record in their home gym en route to a bubble NCAA tournament berth. On January 8, 2005, the men's basketball team defeated West Coast Conference powerhouse Gonzaga University 89-81 in McKeon, ending a 17-game losing streak against the Zags and handing Gonzaga its first conference loss in 17 games.

It is the largest enclosed arena in Contra Costa County.","[[McKeo’∏]] [[Pav—ñlion]] is a [[∆∑]],500 seat multi-purpose [[ar]] [[ena]] at Saint [[Mray's]] College of California in Moraga, California. Home men's and women's basketball and volleyball games are held in the gymnasium, the team nickname being the Gaels. Many athletic camps for youths also use the gym, primarily in the summer, and other on-campus events, such as the Baccalaureate mass, are also held there. Banners commemorating successful seasons, championships and post-season appearances for all Saint Mary's sports hang on the back wall. At well-attended games, the court-level bleachers opposite the benches are reserved entirely for students. Common criticism of the gym, including by students, is its age and size. It is one of the smaller gyms in the West Coast Conference. The seating is mainly along two sides, running along the long sides of the court. Behind one basket is a large wall, and behind another a handful of elevated, VIP seats. Seating is mostly bleacher-style, not stadium style. However, many feel that the small size of the gym adds to the intensity of the crowd at sold-out games, when the cheers of 3,500 fans are amplified due to the small space. Because of this, McKeon Pavilion is considered by many to be one of the tougher gyms to play in for an opposing team. Current athletic director Mark Orr has said there are design plans that would knock out the front and back walls of the gym, adding 1,000 seats, but there is not yet funding for the project.
