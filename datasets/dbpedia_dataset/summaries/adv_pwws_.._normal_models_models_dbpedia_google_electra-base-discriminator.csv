"Oleg Mikhailovich Romanishin ([[born]] [[10]] [[January]] 1952 in Lviv) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster and [[former]] European junior [[champion]]. Many honours and [[awards]] were [[bestowed]] on him as a [[young]] [[man]]. [[After]] [[winning]] the European Junior [[Championship]] in 1973, he [[became]] an International [[Master]] the same [[year]]. In 1974 he was a [[member]] of the victorious USSR [[team]] at the [[World]] Student Team [[Championship]] [[held]] in Teesside, England, where he [[scored]] the [[best]] [[result]] for board [[4]] (8/9). The [[following]] [[year]], he had a terrific [[result]] at the USSR Championship, sharing [[second]] [[place]] with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. [[In]] 1976, his Grandmaster [[title]] was ratified. [[He]] has an [[impressive]] [[collection]] of [[tournament]] [[victories]] [[including]] [[Odessa]] 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. [[Playing]] the Hungarian Open [[Championship]] at Györ in 1990 he [[enjoyed]] a most [[impressive]] victory, [[finishing]] a clear 2 points ahead of the field. [[Second]] [[place]] [[finishes]] at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win [[smaller]] events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. [[At]] the Olympiads he [[represented]] the Soviet [[Union]] in 1978 and thereafter [[played]] for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 [[silver]] medals and [[2]] [[bronze]]. At the European Team Chess [[Championships]] his medal haul has amounted to an incredible [[6]] gold and [[1]] [[silver]]. His chess [[playing]] [[style]] has been described as aggressive and this [[may]] be a [[result]] of the coaching he [[received]] as a junior. [[Along]] with a [[group]] of other [[aspiring]] masters, he was [[first]] coached by Viktor Kart (an [[instructor]] of the Lviv [[Sports]] Academy) and then, as an improver, was [[assigned]] a [[senior]] master as a [[tutor]]/mentor. In his case the [[master]] was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world [[champion]] noted for his [[attacking]] chess. In respect of chess [[opening]] theory, he has a reputation for the use of [[rare]], offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues [[jam]] [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating [[point]] of the [[hostilities]] between the [[Hittites]] and the Assyrians for [[control]] over the [[remnants]] of the [[former]] [[empire]] of Mitanni.

"Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an [[Orthodox]] Christian [[saint]], commemorated on 14 April in the Church of Greece.

He converted to Islam and took the [[name]] Mehmet, but [[later]] repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a [[deep]] depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who [[tried]] to [[cover]] up for him by altering the [[records]] of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and [[demanded]] to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to [[let]] him go.
