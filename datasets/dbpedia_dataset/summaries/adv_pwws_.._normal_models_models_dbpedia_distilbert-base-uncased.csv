Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The town also suffered the Great Fire of Northampton (1675) which destroyed most of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow following the creation of the Grand Union Canal and the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, becoming an industrial centre for footwear and leather manufacture. After the World Wars, Northampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a New Town in 1968, accelerating development in the town. Northampton unsuccessfully applied for unitary status in 1996 and city status in 2000; the town continues to expand with many areas undergoing urban renewal.

His [[return]] to cycling in 1913 was successful, starting in four Victorian races between 25 and 80 miles finishing either first or [[fastest]] times in each with victories over [[top]] riders including twice defeating Don Kirkham. In 1915 Munro and others broke away from the League of Victorian Wheelmen to form the Victorian Racing Cyclists' Union  and competed at a meeting on 27 February 1915.

"Perfect [[Records]] was a United States-based [[record]] [[label]] [[founded]] in 1922 by Pathé Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs. Many issues of [[Perfect]] [[records]] were pressed in red-brown shellac as opposed to the more common black shellac of the era. Pathe's acoustic recording technique was to record performances on a giant cylinder and dub the music to create the disc master. This didn't degrade the sound quality, but records produced this way tended to have a lot of rumble that was not detected by wind-up phonographs of the day. Their slogan on the record sleeve was \""Better records can't be made\"". Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.","Perfect [[disc]] was a United States-based [[tape]] [[pronounce]] [[found]] in 1922 by Pathé Records to produce cheap 78 rpm discs.

"[[In]] 1303, the [[Byzantine]] Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the [[spring]] and summer of the same [[year]].

When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium.

The [[story]] focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school.

"The [[Word]] is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.

"The Taradale Viaduct is a [[large]] [[wrought]] [[iron]] box girder [[bridge]] over [[Back]] Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo [[Railway]] in Victoria Australia.

The [[design]] [[work]] was then [[taken]] over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the [[bridge]] designs [[completed]] by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the [[bridge]] was [[made]] by Rowland [[Brotherhood]], of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the [[supervision]] of British [[Railway]] [[engineer]] Isambard [[Kingdom]] Brunel.

[[Completion]] of the [[permanent]] [[way]] was to be by 31 July 1861.

"The [[SM]] Kirov [[Stadium]] was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was [[one]] of the [[largest]] [[stadiums]] anywhere in the world.

The [[stands]] of the Kirov [[stadium]] were [[located]] on the [[slopes]] of a [[circular]] artificial [[mound]] in the western [[part]] of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the [[Gulf]] of Finland. Construction [[started]] in 1932, initial [[project]] was [[designed]] by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on [[groundworks]] for the artificial [[mound]] on the sea [[shore]]. Construction was [[interrupted]] by the [[World]] War [[II]] and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the [[return]] of citizens to [[Leningrad]]. Thousands of [[Red]] Army and [[Red]] Navy [[recruits]] were also conscripted as [[labor]] [[force]] for construction. The [[stadium]] was [[open]] on [[30]] July 1950 with the game between [[two]] [[main]] Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the [[stadium]] [[held]] 100,000 people (including 16,000 [[standing]] [[places]]). For the [[match]] between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional [[temporary]] stands were [[installed]], increasing the capacity of the [[stadium]] to 110,000.

"The Usoi [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] landslide [[dam]] along the Murghab River in Tajikistan. At 567 [[metres]] (1,860 ft) [[high]], it is the [[tallest]] [[dam]] in the world, either [[natural]] or man-made. The [[dam]] was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake [[caused]] a massive landslide that blocked the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the [[village]] of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by Usoi Dam now holds Sarez Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the [[dam]], which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the dam at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level.

Geologists are concerned that the Usoi [[Dam]] may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event.
