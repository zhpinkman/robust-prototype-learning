"Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional [[character]] in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Freeza makes his debut in Chapter #247: Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek (暗雲うずまくナメック星 An'un Uzumaku Namekkusei), first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 6, 1989, as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe. Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Freeza is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the series due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. He is also directly responsible for the murder of Burdock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, and the second death of Kuririn, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy.","Freeza (Japanese: フリーザ Hepburn: Furīza), spelled Frieza in Funimation's English anime dub, is a fictional [[series]] in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama.

"The 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was [[held]] on Sunday, 22 [[May]] 2011, to elect the [[8th]] General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of [[Asturias]]. [[At]] [[stake]] were all 45 seats in the General [[Junta]], determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous [[community]] since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 [[election]], the Asturias [[Forum]] (FAC), a split from the People's Party ([[PP]]), won the most seats [[despite]] PSOE [[obtaining]] more votes.

The resulting government, however, was not [[able]] to gather legislative support to approve its 2012 regional [[budget]], with both PP and PSOE blocking the [[vote]], resulting in a fresh election being held in March 2012.","The 2011 Asturian parliamentary [[party]] was [[elected]] on Sunday, 22 [[may]] 2011, to elect the [[31st]] General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of [[asturias]].

"The Ten [[Days]] of Brescia (Italian: Dieci giornate di Brescia) was a revolt which [[broke]] out in the northern [[Italian]] [[city]] of that name, which [[lasted]] from March 23 to April 1, 1849. In the early 19th century Brescia was part of the Austrian puppet state called Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The revolt, headed by the patriot Tito Speri, began on the same day as the Battle of Novara (though news of Austria's victory there had not yet reached Brescia). The Austrian troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily cannonaded the city, damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the revolt, when reinforcements arrived.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children.

"Andrew [[George]] Silver ([[born]] 13 January 1967 in London, England) is a [[former]] international motorcycle speedway [[rider]] who represented England at test level. His [[father]] is former [[rider]] and current speedway promoter Len Silver. Andrew [[Silver]] took his first rides in 1983 at [[father]] Len's Rye House circuit, making rapid progress from [[reserve]] to heat leader in three years. When Len, decided to sell his [[interest]] in the Rockets, son Andrew was widely expected to [[make]] the move into top flight [[British]] League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena [[Essex]] Hammers for a reported £9,000. Andrew, the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the [[club]], setting numerous records wherever he rode. He was [[capped]] by England at senior level, qualified for successive [[British]] Finals and set numerous track records wherever he rode. He has a Hammers career [[average]] of 10.52. Silver also enjoyed considerable [[individual]] success during his tenure with the Hammers, winning the prestigious end-of-season National League [[Riders']] [[Championship]] in 1987 at Coventry to add to the Grand Slam [[title]] he won earlier that year at Oxford. In 1988 Andrew moved into top flight [[racing]], [[signing]] for British League Swindon. His career stuttered from this point on and - [[despite]] four seasons in Robins' colours - failed to [[live]] up to expectations. He moved to Eastbourne in 1992 - and was joined by his father in 1993 - before calling it a [[day]] at the start of the 1994 season. Despite reported attempts to lure him out of the saddle - Andrew [[caused]] a sensation by almost winning an individual meeting at Arena [[Essex]] during a one-off [[appearance]] in 1997 - Silver's leathers remained on the hook. [[He]] retired from speedway early to [[take]] up a post in his father's ski holiday [[company]]. After a long break from the sport, Silver [[made]] a successful comeback as a member of the 2009 Rye House Rockets [[team]] in the Premier League and [[scored]] a six-ride maximum for the Rockets in their [[victory]] over Stoke on 2 September 2009.

"[[In]] 1303, the Byzantine Emperor [[Andronicus]] [[II]] Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de [[Flor]] to campaign against the Turks in the spring and [[summer]] of the same year.

"The George P. Coleman Memorial [[Bridge]] (known locally as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double swing bridge that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. [[The]] bridge is the only public [[crossing]] of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) at just above its source at West Point. Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current 3,750-foot (1,140 m)-long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial highway. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy's Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost 90 feet (27 m) above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world. The toll [[bridge]] was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to 1922 was the head of the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT).

"The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[band]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"".

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s.

"Asia are a British progressive rock [[band]]. The band was formed in 1981 as a supergroup of four members from different progressive rock bands: John Wetton (former bassist/vocalist of bands including King Crimson, Family, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep, UK and Wishbone Ash), Steve Howe (guitarist of Yes), Geoff Downes (keyboardist of Yes and The Buggles) and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Atomic Rooster). With their debut album Asia from 1982 reaching No. 1 in several countries, Asia ranks as one of the most popular progressive rock bands in history. The band has undergone multiple line-up changes during its history, but in 2006, the original line-up reunited. As a result, a band called Asia Featuring John Payne exists as a continuation of John Payne's career as Asia's frontman from 1991 until Wetton's return in 2006. In 2013, Howe retired from the band to continue with Yes and pursue other projects, and was replaced by guitarist Sam Coulson, completing the current lineup.","Asia are a British progressive rock [[album]].

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of population served.

The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger [[route]] in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several [[sections]] of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger [[journeys]]. The WCML is also one of the [[busiest]] freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight [[corridor]] linking the European mainland (via the Channel [[Tunnel]]) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route.

Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h).

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in [[Germany]] on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter [[turnout]] was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller. Following his appointment, Müller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[councillors]] were [[elected]] in [[germany]] on 20 May 1928.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cut-Off]] remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna [[limited]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[railroad]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"The 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead.

"The Hammersmith & City [[line]] of the London Underground runs between Hammersmith and Barking. Coloured salmon pink on the tube map, it serves 29 stations in 15.8 miles (25.5 km). It runs below ground in the central section between Paddington and Bow Road; between Farringdon and Aldgate East it skirts the City of London, the capital's financial heart. The tunnels are just below the surface and are a similar size to those on British main lines. Most of the track and all stations are shared with the District, Circle or Metropolitan lines, the other parts of London Underground's sub-surface railway, and over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year on this line and the Circle line. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway began the world's first underground railway service between Paddington and Farringdon with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The following year, a railway west from Paddington to Hammersmith was opened and this soon became operated and owned jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western railways. The line was then extended to the east, in stages, reaching the East London Railway in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906, and, in 1936, after the Metropolitan Railway had been absorbed by London Passenger Transport Board, some Hammersmith & City trains were extended over the former District Railway line to Barking. The Hammersmith & City route was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, since when it has appeared as a separate line.

"Lava-Ströme (Streams of Lava), opus 74, is the name of a waltz [[composed]] by Johann Strauss II. It was written to commemorate the volcanic activity within Vesuvius in 1850. The waltz was first performed at a benefit ball going under the title of a \""Ball in Vesuvius\"" at the Sofienbad-Saal in Vienna on January 29, 1850. Lava-Ströme was one of the more imaginative of Strauss' waltzes, having a dramatic 105-bar introduction symbolising the eruption of the volcano.

"[[The]] Newcastle [[Jets]] 2010–11 season was the Newcastle Jets' sixth [[season]] [[since]] the inception of the Australian A-League and the tenth since the club's founding, in 2000. It was [[announced]] on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new [[direction]] which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 [[fans]] will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10.

It was [[appointed]] on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new [[management]] which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 [[people]] will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. The line is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. The [[line]] has at various stages been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light rail, stadtbahn, rapid [[transit]], bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro [[line]] starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a [[station]] at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale [[development]] of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker [[Station]]. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the [[site]] be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. [[The]] project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed [[schedule]] for [[construction]].","The Fornebu [[network]] (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway.

A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale [[expansion]] of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker [[stations]]. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the [[place]] be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. [[a]] project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed [[timetable]] for [[build]].",2

DJ Boy must rescue Maria, [[combat]] the Dark Knights, and [[defeat]] the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade [[side]] tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it [[being]] stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and [[combat]] them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various [[tier]] and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, [[resulting]] with a battle with a boss at the [[peak]] of each level. Along the path, the player also [[gathers]] prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each [[tier]] (in the home version, the arcade simply [[displayed]] these as points).

"The 1918 Buffalo Niagaras [[season]] was a top-level semi-professional football team in Buffalo, New York. The team, which was the successor to the Buffalo All-Stars (1915–1917) and predecessor to the 1919 Buffalo Prospects, was one of four teams that played in the newly created Buffalo Semi-Professional Football League. The league was created to accommodate the travel restrictions put in place because of World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic, which required a delay in the start of the season (not starting until October 27) and prevented Buffalo's teams from leaving the city. Because of the greatly fewer number of teams playing across the country in 1918, the Niagaras had greater access to the remaining players who were not in the war. The 1918 Niagaras, whose name was borrowed from an earlier (and later) semi-pro team, were the first Buffalo team to employ former Michigan Wolverines and Youngstown Patricians quarterback Ernest \""Tommy\"" Hughitt; Hughitt would go on to play for the Prospects and its NFL successors through 1924 and live in Buffalo for the rest of his life.

Only in one game did the Niagaras give up any points at all, surrendering a single touchdown and extra point to the Buffalo Hydraulics through the entire season. Because of the travel restrictions, the Niagaras were not allowed to challenge the other teams in the nation (such as the first-place Dayton Triangles, the still-active Detroit Heralds or even Buffalo's regional rivals, the Rochester Jeffersons), leaving it unknown how the team would have fared compared to the rest of the country.","The 1918 Buffalo Niagaras [[were]] was a top-level semi-professional football team in Buffalo, New York. The team, which was the successor to the Buffalo All-Stars (1915–1917) and predecessor to the 1919 Buffalo Prospects, was one of four teams that played in the newly created Buffalo Semi-Professional Football League. The league was created to accommodate the travel restrictions put in place because of World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic, which required a delay in the start of the season (not starting until October 27) and prevented Buffalo's teams from leaving the city. Because of the greatly fewer number of teams playing across the country in 1918, the Niagaras had greater access to the remaining players who were not in the war. The 1918 Niagaras, whose name was borrowed from an earlier (and later) semi-pro team, were the first Buffalo team to employ former Michigan Wolverines and Youngstown Patricians quarterback Ernest \""Tommy\"" Hughitt; Hughitt would go on to play for the Prospects and its NFL successors through 1924 and live in Buffalo for the rest of his life.

"The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[play]]. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.","The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[playwright]].

"The Lifestyle PodNetwork (LPN) [[began]] in 2007 with a show called Podcasters' Emporium, a podcast specifically designed to help people create better sounding podcasts. This show, hosted by Dave Gray and James Williams, attracted a large audience of podcasters almost immediately. Podcasters’ Emporium addressed a growing problem faced by citizen media; People enjoy creating podcasts, but most do not have the technical and marketing knowledge required to attract listeners.

"MacHomer is a one-person [[play]] by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons. Miller first conceived of the idea in 1994, when he was performing in a production of Macbeth. The first performance of MacHomer was at the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1995. MacHomer has been re-written a number of times. The early version of the play was more of a stand-up comedy routine, but in 2000, it was expanded into a theatrical production. In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. The script of the play \""remains 85% Shakespeare\"" and mostly follows the plot of Macbeth. Miller performs the various roles using voices from The Simpsons characters, using more than 50 voices. The set includes a video screen at the back of the stage, and sound and video effects are incorporated into the performance. Miller has performed the play in over 150 cities around the world, including performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival. MacHomer has received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics felt that the play seems more like a group of sketches, while others felt that Miller's Homer Simpson voice was one of his weaker impersonations. According to Miller, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening is a fan of the play and gave him permission to perform it.","MacHomer is a one-person [[cast]] by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons.

The provocative subject matter, musical experimentation, and often nihilistic attitudes explored in their music would prove influential in the development of punk rock and alternative music. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground are now recognized as among the most influential acts of the rock era for their integration of rock music with the avant-garde. Their 1967 debut album The Velvet Underground & Nico (featuring German singer and collaborator Nico) was called the \""most prophetic rock album ever made\"" by Rolling Stone in 2003. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the band No. 19 on its list of the \""100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"".

Cookie is related to Ribon. Ribon Comic, a monthly magazine which was a sister magazine of Ribon, changed its title to Bouquet (ぶ〜け) in 1978. Bouquet stopped publication in March 2000. In 1996, the Ribon editing department at Shueisha began publishing a manga magazine called Ribon Teens which featured a mixture of both the then-new and popular Ribon manga artists like Ai Yazawa, Miho Obana, and Mihona Fujii, and classic Ribon manga artists like Jun Hasegawa, Koi Ikeno, and Aoi Hiiragi. This magazine was published a couple of times in 1996 and 1997 before folding. In 1999, Shueisha revived the Ribon Teens concept in a new magazine which soon received the title Cookie. The first issue of Cookie was soon published and the second issue followed in 2000 and being published on the 26th of each month.

As of 2008, the circulation was about 175,000, which by 2015 had declined to 56,000, part of an industry-wide trend. Cookie is related to Ribon. Ribon Comic, a monthly magazine which was a sister magazine of Ribon, changed its title to Bouquet (ぶ〜け) in 1978. Bouquet stopped publication in March 2000. In 1996, the Ribon editing department at Shueisha began publishing a manga magazine called Ribon Teens which featured a mixture of both the then-new and popular Ribon manga artists like Ai Yazawa, Miho Obana, and Mihona Fujii, and classic Ribon manga artists like Jun Hasegawa, Koi Ikeno, and Aoi Hiiragi. This magazine was published a couple of times in 1996 and 1997 before folding. In 1999, Shueisha revived the Ribon Teens concept in a new magazine which soon received the title Cookie. The first issue of Cookie was soon published and the second issue followed in 2000 and being published on the 26th of each month.

"Ten [[Broeck]] (June 29, 1872 – June 28, 1887) was an American U.S. Racing Hall of Fame Thoroughbred [[racehorse]] whose 1878 match race win in Louisville, against the great California mare Mollie McCarty was [[immortalized]] in the Kentucky folk song commonly called Molly and Tenbrooks. Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten [[Broeck's]] dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the [[horse]] became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for [[two-year-old]] colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten [[Broeck]] was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a [[much-talked-about]] match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood.

"Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a satellite [[providing]] television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat). The television channels it broadcasts include BBC World News, Australia Network and regular feeds of Entertainment Tonight and The Wall Street Journal Report.

Intelsat 8 has an even lower powered beam than Intelsat 19 with a Pacific beam more focused on South East Asia and Australia than the South Pacific.","Intelsat 5 (aka IS-5, PAS-5 and Arabsat 2C) was a satellite [[broadcasting]] television and communication services for ITSO and Inmarsat, which it was jointly commissioned by. It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS). PanAmSat became HSC's first customer to launch the new model, on Aug. 28, 1997, on a Russian Proton-K Blok-DM3 rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. PAS-5 provides satellite services in the Americas, with access to Europe, including direct-to-home television services in Mexico. Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat). The television channels it broadcasts include BBC World News, Australia Network and regular feeds of Entertainment Tonight and The Wall Street Journal Report.

"Flightline was an [[airline]] based in Southend-on-Sea, England. It operated branded wet lease, ad hoc and contract passenger and freight charter services, as well as VIP flights and aircraft sales and maintenance. Sub-services were flown for major airlines in Europe as required. Its main bases' were London Southend Airport. The company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, and was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats. Flightline operated up to 14 flights a day between Aberdeen (ABZ) and Scatsta in the Shetland Isles (SCS) on behalf of Royal Dutch Shell and other members of the IAC (Integrated Aviation Consortium). Offshore workers were flown to Scatsta Airport and then transferred onto helicopters to several oil platforms, however this contract was due to end in February 2009. Flightline also had a maintenance facility at its Southend base which provided base maintenance for the BAe-146 fleet as well as a small number of 3rd party aircraft. The engineering facility was closed in July 2008 in order to raise more funds to keep the airline running. At time of closure of the airline in December 2008, they had contracts to operate several services on behalf of British Airways out of London City Airport, and also for the Ford car company from their base at Southend (near the Ford European headquarters) to Cologne, Germany. The MD-80 fleet operated a range of holiday charter flights to the Mediterranean, Manchester being a common departure point. The MD-80 fleet were grounded at Southend in November 2008 due to the lack of business in the winter season. Upon Flightlines demise the airline had debts exceeding £6 Million.","Flightline was an [[airport]] based in Southend-on-Sea, England.

"Presidential [[elections]] were held in [[France]] on 24 April and 8 May 1988. In 1981, the Socialist Party leader, François Mitterrand, was elected President of France and the Left won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the right regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \""cohabit\"" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \""reserved domain\"" – foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates opposed the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet advocated liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social movements, supported covertly by President Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was challenged by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \""cohabitation\"", claiming that it is incompatible with the \""spirit of the Fifth Republic\"". He appeared as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he announced his candidacy, Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first [[round]] by SOFRES polls institute, against 23% for Barre. But, from the start of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and took the lead among the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist candidate was uncertain. Mitterrand said he was not sure he would run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel Rocard campaigned for the nomination. The favourite to win the [[election]] [[according]] to the polls, the incumbent president announced his candidacy at the end of March. He wrote an open letter to the French, where he proposed a moderate programme (\""neither nationalisations, nor privatizations\"") and advocated a \""united France\"" against \""the appropriation of the state by a clan\"", targeting Chirac and the RPR. He benefited from the decline of the French Communist Party, represented by André Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \""reforming Communist\"", Pierre Juquin and a Trotskyist, Arlette Laguiller. Meanwhile, the Ecologist Antoine Waechter refused to ally the Greens with either the left or the right. On the far-right, the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, tried to confirm the FN's good result in the previous legislative election. The French economy shrugging off the early 1980s recession with 4% growth that year put the economy off the mind's of voters as well as popular social programs being implemented, both of which gave Mitterrand the economic argument to achieve a second term despite the fallback in the last legislative election that caused cohabitation.","Presidential [[inaugurated]] were held in [[france]] on 24 April and 8 May 1988.

"The Church of St. Aidan is an Anglican [[church]] in The Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto, Canada. The church has about 400 members, and around 150 people show up on Sundays.

When the streetcar stretched eastward and the area began to grow rapidly in the 1890s, the church remained housed in a tent, but one large enough to hold 500 people. A permanent church was finally established in 1907, and work on the church building was completed in 1910. In 2006 the church became the centre of controversy when the congregation under Rev. Stephen Kirkegaard decided to participate in the Out of the Cold program to provide shelter to the homeless during the winter. The program takes place in various religious institutions across the city, and helps provide extra space during the winter months when remaining outside can be deadly. St. Aidan's proposed providing beds for twelve people once a week. This sparked strenuous opposition from neighbours in the expensive Beaches area. Concerns about the homeless bringing crime and reducing property values in the neighbourhood prompted some local residents to try to get a court order to halt the program.

"Ah [[Pook]] Is [[Here]] was a collaboration between author William S. [[Burroughs]] and [[artist]] Malcolm Mc Neill.
