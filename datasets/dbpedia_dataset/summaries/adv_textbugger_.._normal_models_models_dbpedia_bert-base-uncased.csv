"[[On]] [[20]] [[October]] 1990, Manchester [[United]] Football Club faced [[Arsenal]] Football Club in a Football League [[First]] [[Division]] fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the [[match]] came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

Their third studio album, 2002's Head on Straight, charted on the Billboard 200 for one week, yet the band was nominated for two Grammy awards related to the album. After the band ended a four year hiatus in 2008, the greatest hits compilation A Casual Affair: The Best of Tonic was released in 2009.

"The Cologne–Aachen high-speed [[line]] is the [[German]] [[part]] of the Trans-European transport networks project high-speed [[line]] Paris–Brussels–Cologne. It is not a newly built [[railway]] [[line]], but a project to upgrade the existing railway line which was opened in 1841 by the Rhenish Railway Company. When it was continued into Belgium in 1843, it became the world's first international railway [[line]]. The line inside Germany has a length of about 70 kilometres (43 mi). The first 40 km (25 mi) from Cologne to Düren have been rebuilt. Since 2002 the line allows for speeds up to 250 km/h (160 mph).

"[[3043]] [[San]] [[Diego]], provisional [[designation]] 1982 [[SA]], is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and [[slow]] [[rotator]] from the [[inner]] [[regions]] of the [[asteroid]] belt, [[approximately]] [[4]].[[7]] [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by [[American]] female [[astronomer]] [[Eleanor]] [[Helin]] on 30 September [[1982]], at the U.S. [[Palomar]] Observatory in California. The [[bright]] E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the [[Hungaria]] [[family]], which [[form]] the [[innermost]] [[dense]] [[concentration]] of [[asteroids]] in the [[Solar]] [[System]]. [[The]] [[asteroid]] [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] at a [[distance]] of 1.7–2.1 [[AU]] once every 2 [[years]] and 8 [[months]] ([[977]] [[days]]). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an [[eccentricity]] of 0.11 and an [[inclination]] of 22° with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. The [[first]] [[observation]] was [[taken]] at Crimea–[[Nauchnij]] in [[1974]], [[extending]] the [[asteroid's]] [[observation]] [[arc]] by 8 [[years]] [[prior]] to its [[discovery]]. [[In]] [[March]] [[2005]], a [[rotational]] light-curve for this [[asteroid]] was [[obtained]] from [[photometric]] observations by [[U]].S. [[astronomer]] [[Brian]] [[D]]. Warner at his [[Palmer]] [[Divide]] [[Observatory]] (PDO), [[Colorado]]. It gave a long [[rotation]] period of 105.7±[[0]].1 hours with a [[brightness]] variation of 0.60 in magnitude ([[U]]=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that [[originally]] gave a [[much]] shorter period of [[30]].72±[[0]].02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude ([[U]]=0). [[This]] [[previously]] [[published]] period was only preliminary and is now [[considered]] [[wrong]] [[upon]] [[re-examination]]. According to the [[survey]] carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field]] [[Infrared]] [[Survey]] Explorer, the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.[[8]] kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve [[Link]]  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.[[2]], corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and [[orbital]] [[group]], respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.[[6]] [[kilometers]], based on an [[absolute]] magnitude of 13.[[7]]. [[The]] minor planet was named for the city of [[San]] [[Diego]], California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the [[local]] [[light]] pollution (see [[dark-sky]] movement). [[Palomar]] mountain is [[located]] [[within]] [[San]] [[Diego]] [[County]], California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the [[light]] pollution from the city [[would]] ruin their ability to use the [[observatory]].

"[[Weyerbacher]] [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in [[Easton]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United]] [[States]], founded in 1995 by Dan and [[Sue]] [[Weirback]]. The [[brewery]] is [[well]] known for its \""huge taste\"" [[beers]]. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a [[one-off]] 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into [[Heresy]], Blithering Idiot into Insanity, [[Merry]] Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into [[Blasphemy]]. These four styles ([[imperial]] stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of [[huge]] [[beers]], though persons accustomed to more [[mainstream]] beer may find them an acquired taste. [[In]] September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a [[seasonal]] India pale ale, marketed as [[Harvest]] Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

"[[Ishpatina]] [[Ridge]] is the [[highest]] [[point]] of land in the [[Canadian]] [[province]] of [[Ontario]], at an [[estimated]] [[693]] m ([[2]],[[274]] [[ft]]) above [[sea]] [[level]]. [[Ishpatina]] Ridge [[rises]] [[approximately]] 300 m ([[984]] ft) above the [[immediate]] [[area]].

Before then, the more popular [[Maple]] [[Mountain]] was thought to be higher. [[The]] [[ridge]] [[lies]] in Lady [[Evelyn-Smoothwater]] [[Provincial]] [[Park]]. Due to its remote [[location]], Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to [[reach]]. [[The]] [[closest]] [[major]] [[highway]], Highway 560, is more than 30 [[km]] north. There are a few logging [[roads]] and trails in the remote area, but they are [[difficult]] to travel in [[poor]] weather.

[[While]] a [[northern]] route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are [[numerous]] portages [[making]] it [[particularly]] onerous. This [[route]] has [[traditionally]] been used for a winter-time [[approach]] by [[ski]]/snowshoe. [[Historically]], a fire tower [[atop]] the [[ridge]] was [[staffed]] by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the [[site]] by [[float]] [[plane]]. [[The]] [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" comes from an [[Ojibwe]] [[language]] [[word]] ishpadinaa, [[meaning]] \""high [[place]]/ridge\"". The [[city]] of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette [[County]], and Spadina [[Avenue]] in Toronto, Ontario derive their names from the same word.

The [[story]] [[focuses]] on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation. This series was first serialized in the Japanese manga magazine Dear+ in 2002. It has been licensed by Taifu Comics.",1
"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] [[includes]] well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the [[culminating]] point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the [[reign]] of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.","The [[Bɑttle]] of Niḫriya was the [[leading]] point of the [[hostilitіes]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main [[line]] between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The [[Cut-Off]] ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The [[Cut-Off]] also had no [[railroad]] crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the [[Cut-Off]] remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976.

"The [[Taradale]] [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box girder [[bridge]] over Back Creek at [[Taradale]], Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia.

"The 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league.

The stadium was [[named]] after Sergey Kirov. The [[stands]] of the Kirov [[stadium]] were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky [[Island]], on the coast of the [[Gulf]] of [[Finland]]. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by [[architect]] Aleksandr Nikolsky and his [[workshop]]. [[During]] the 1930s and 1940s, [[construction]] was mainly [[focused]] on groundworks for the [[artificial]] mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of [[citizens]] to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as [[labor]] force for [[construction]]. The stadium was open on 30 [[July]] 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad [[teams]], Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov [[stadium]] was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006. A new stadium (see New Zenit Stadium) is under construction, tentatively scheduled to open in 2016.","The SM [[Bolshoi]] [[Gymnasium]] was a multi-purpose [[gymnasium]] in [[S𝚝]].

"[[In]] Greek mythology, Lepreus (Λεπρεύς) was a [[son]] of Caucon (Glaucon) or Pyrgeus, and [[grandson]] of Poseidon; [[one]] [[account]] [[calls]] him [[son]] of Poseidon.

[[Nova]] [[Hokeis]] faced a daunting schedule, beginning with a nationally-televisioned game against the defending national co-champion USC Trojans. That game, known as the BCA Classic, was the first NCAA college football game of the year, and would be followed by a tough conference schedule. Tech lost to eventual BCS National Champion USC at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, 24-13, losing the lead late in the third quarter. After a 63-0 shellacking of Western Michigan, Tech played its first ever ACC game on September 18, against Duke. Tech prevailed 41-17 in Lane Stadium. The Hokies dropped to 2-2 following a 17-16 home loss to N.C. State, in which the Hokies missed a would-be winning field goal as time expired. The team then needed to win five of its next eight games to extend its 11-season streak of playing in a post-season bowl game. After reeling off three-straight wins, including a 19-13 squeaker over then #7 West Virginia, the Hokies' fortunes looked bleak in the fourth quarter of their game against Georgia Tech in Atlanta on ESPN Thursday night college [[soccer]]. Tech was down 14-0 at one point and trailed 20-12 with 5:28 left in the fourth quarter. [[Technical]] racked up 22 unanswered points to exterminate the Yellow Jackets. Tech would go on to win their remaining regular-season games, including a 24-10 win over then #16 Virginia in Lane Stadium and a 16-10 away victory over then #9 Miami, to clinch the ACC [[Tournament]]. As ACC Champions, Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2005 Sugar Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game in New Orleans, Louisiana. Virginia Tech faced Auburn, a team that had gone undefeated in the regular season but was denied a bid to the national championship game by virtue of its lower rank in the BCS poll. In a game that was not decided until the final two minutes, Virginia Tech lost to Auburn 16-13. Tech was led by quarterback Bryan Randall during the season. Randall was named ACC player of the Year.",6
