"The [[2011]] Asturian parliamentary [[election]] was [[held]] on Sunday, 22 May [[2011]], to [[elect]] the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias. [[At]] [[stake]] were all 45 seats in the General Junta, determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. The FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco √Ålvarez Cascos, former Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as PP's candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture voting of √Ålvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. [[He]] was a prot√©g√© of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf [[Challenge]], previously known as the [[Million]] Dollar [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] men's professional [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money [[event]] for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes [[place]] between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. [[The]] tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play [[event]], with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. The 2016 [[event]] will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available players from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The remainder of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years winner of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations.

"[[Archibald]] ([[died]] 1298) was a 13th-century [[Scottish]] [[prelate]] [[best]] known for [[involvement]] in a dispute with the Pope.

[[His]] [[origins]] are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before [[1253]]. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of [[Moray]]. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop [[Archibald]] confirmed the election of [[one]] [[Andrew]] de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or [[simultaneously]] appointed his own [[candidate]], [[Nicholas]] de Hedon, based on an [[earlier]] reservation of the [[position]]. There was [[litigation]] at the [[Papal]] see, through which [[Hedon]] emerged [[victorious]]. [[Bishop]] [[Archibald]], apparently [[concerned]] he had been [[placed]] in a state of excommunication, [[petitioned]] Pope [[Alexander]] [[IV]] and was absolved on 22 [[December]] [[1255]]. [[Bishop]] Archibald, like all [[Scottish]] bishops, was summonded to the [[Second]] [[Council]] of [[Lyon]]. [[A]] [[provincial]] [[council]] at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the [[Bishop]] of [[Moray]] as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. [[Bishop]] [[Archibald]] was present at the [[Convention]] of [[Birgham]] in [[1290]]. [[At]] some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, [[Mormaer]] of [[Ross]], committed an [[outrage]] to the church or [[lands]] of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In [[compensation]], Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in [[Ross]]. The bishop was also [[involved]] in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of [[Mar]], which in 1268 [[resulted]] in the latter's [[excommunication]].

Their seventh-place finish in 2013‚Äì14 and loss to Fleetwood Town in the play-offs meant it was their third successive season in League Two. The season ran from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015.

With the team only one place above the relegation zone by mid-October 2014, Worthington resigned and was replaced by former Scunthorpe United manager Russ Wilcox. After a six-match unbeaten run from late-March to mid-April 2015, York ensured survival from relegation before finishing in 18th-position in the 24-team 2014‚Äì15 League Two. York were knocked out of the 2014‚Äì15 FA Cup, League Cup and Football League Trophy in their opening round matches. 32 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were 13 different goalscorers.

The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"Weyerbacher Brewing [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer. Dan Weirback has said the acre of hops were planted on a trial basis, as a response to a worldwide shortage of hops and price increases that suppliers informed brewers of in late 2007. As of November 2008, the brewery had plans to grow another crop and was exploring the availability of small-scale harvest equipment. Weyerbacher sales have increased from $1.2 million in 2006 to $3.6 million in 2011.

"[[Martin]] Bruce [[Cameron]] ([[born]] 24 August [[1936]]), Australian [[politician]], was a [[member]] of the [[Australian]] [[Senate]] and the [[South]] [[Australian]] [[Legislative]] [[Council]]. [[In]] [[1968]] [[Cameron]] contested the [[safe]] Labor House of [[Assembly]] seat of Millicent for the Liberal and [[Country]] [[League]] (LCL) after objecting to the views of [[incumbent]] [[Des]] Corcoran on [[road]] [[transport]] [[control]]. [[Cameron]] gained a 13% swing but lost by [[one]] [[vote]]. [[Cameron]] challenged the result at the Court of [[Disputed]] Returns, which ordered a [[by-election]]. [[Corcoran]] comfortably won the by-election. Early in [[1969]], [[Senator]] [[Keith]] Laught died suddenly and Cameron was [[nominated]] by Premier Steele Hall as his [[replacement]]. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the [[vacancy]] was held to coincide with the 1969 [[Federal]] Election in October and he was [[defeated]] by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). [[Cameron]] [[entered]] South Australia's [[Legislative]] Council in [[1971]] [[following]] the retirement of [[Sir]] [[Norman]] Jude. He [[became]] an important [[ally]] of Steele [[Hall]] (now Leader of the Opposition), [[representing]] the increasingly [[visible]] [[moderate]] forces [[within]] the [[party]]. [[Cameron]] often opposed his [[fellow]] [[LCL]] [[Legislative]] Councillors, due to his support for Universal Suffrage for that [[chamber]]. This tension [[within]] the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the [[following]] year. Led by [[Hall]] and Robin [[Millhouse]], the [[movement]] originally functioned as a faction [[within]] the LCL. [[Cameron]] was one of its most prominent [[supporters]]. [[After]] the 1973 Election, the LCL (led at this [[stage]] by Bruce Eastick) [[expelled]] the [[Liberal]] Movement. [[Although]] some [[Liberal]] Movement members, such as [[future]] Premiers David [[Tonkin]] and [[Dean]] Brown, [[decided]] to remain in the LCL, [[Cameron]] [[left]] with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal [[Movement]] member of the [[Legislative]] Council until the 1975 Election when he was [[joined]] by [[John]] Carnie. [[However]] the Liberal [[Movement]] was vastly outpolled by the LCL ([[renamed]] the Liberal [[Party]] of [[Australia]] in 1974), and there was a [[push]] from within both [[parties]] for reunification. [[In]] 1976 Cameron and Hall [[rejoined]] the Liberal [[Party]], while [[Millhouse]] [[initially]] formed the [[New]] LM before helping [[found]] the Australian Democrats. Despite not [[serving]] in the Tonkin ministry, [[Cameron]] assumed the [[position]] of Leader of the [[Opposition]] in the [[Legislative]] Council after the election of the John Bannon Labor government at the 1982 Elections. [[He]] held this position until his retirement from politics in [[1990]].

[[To]] ascomycetes are a [[monphyletic]] group, i.e. it contains all descendants of [[anyone]] [[shared]] ancestor. This group is of [[singular]] relevance to humans as sources for [[mediinally]] [[pivotal]] compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and [[factories]]. Familiar examples of [[backpack]] [[fungus]] [[icnlude]] morels, [[truffl–µs]], brewer's yeast and [[bakers]] [[fermented]], [[died]] [[mans]] fingers, and [[cups]] [[fungus]]. The [[molds]] symbionts in the majority of [[lich–µns]] ([[faintly]] termed \""[[asco‚Öºichens]]\"") such as [[Cladoina]] belong to the [[Ascom—Écota]]. There are [[innumerable]] plant-pathogenic [[asc–æmycetes]], [[encompass]] [[appe]] [[s]] [[cab]], rice blast, the [[egot]] [[fungus]], black knot, and the [[vaporized]] mildews. [[Various]] species of [[ascomyce]] [[tes]] are biological model organisms in [[experimental]] [[investigative]]. Most famously, Neurospora crassa, several species of yeasts, and Aspergillus [[kinds]] are [[utilized]] in many [[genetic]] and [[portable]] [[biological]] studies.

Love is a Strange and Different Thing) is a fictional [[manga]] written and illustrated by Japanese author Taishi Za≈ç (also known for her sh≈çjo works under the name Mikiyo Tsuda) in 2002. The story focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa.

"Sir [[Matthew]] [[Hale]] [[SL]] (1 [[November]] [[1609]] ‚Äì [[25]] [[December]] [[1676]]) was an [[influential]] English [[barrister]], [[judge]] and [[lawyer]] most noted for his [[treatise]] [[Historia]] [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. Born to a [[barrister]] and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, [[Hale]] was raised by his father's relative, a [[strict]] Puritan, and inherited his faith. [[In]] 1626 he [[matriculated]] at [[Magdalen]] [[Hall]], Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a [[barrister]] like his [[father]] thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his [[estate]]. [[On]] 8 [[November]] 1628 he [[joined]] Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 [[May]] [[1636]]. As a [[barrister]], [[Hale]] [[represented]] a variety of [[Royalist]] figures during the prelude and duration of the [[English]] [[Civil]] [[War]], [[including]] [[Thomas]] Wentworth and [[William]] Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to [[represent]] Charles I at his [[state]] trial, and conceived the [[defence]] [[Charles]] [[used]]. Despite the [[Royalist]] [[loss]], Hale's reputation for integrity and his [[political]] [[neutrality]] saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the [[Hale]] Commission, which [[investigated]] [[law]] [[reform]]. Following the [[Commission's]] [[dissolution]], Oliver [[Cromwell]] made him a Justice of the [[Common]] [[Pleas]]. As a [[judge]], [[Hale]] was [[noted]] for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to [[make]] politically [[unpopular]] decisions which upheld the [[law]]. [[He]] sat in [[Parliament]], [[either]] in the Commons or the [[Upper]] House, in [[every]] Parliament from the First [[Protectorate]] Parliament to the [[Convention]] Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider [[Charles]] [[II's]] reinstatement as [[monarch]], sparking the English Restoration.

Following a bout of illness he [[retired]] on 20 [[February]] [[1676]], [[dying]] [[ten]] months [[later]] on 25 December [[1676]]. [[Hale]] is [[almost]] universally appreciated as an excellent judge and [[jurist]], with his [[central]] legacy coming through his [[written]] work, published after his [[death]]. [[His]] Historia [[Placitorum]] Coron√¶, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law.

This [[included]] him [[going]] to his former barber boss and [[asking]] him to slit his throat [[right]] there, which neither the [[boss]] nor the other barbers did. When this didn't [[work]], he went up to the [[guards]] of a nearby [[leader]] and [[told]] them he had apostatized, which got him [[detained]].

[[Finally]], [[Demetrius]] was taken to the [[local]] market (reportedly, he cheerfully [[sang]] [[Christian]] hymns in his [[way]]), and [[publicly]] executed by beheading; it took three strokes, and his severed head and body, though [[ordered]] to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.","[[St]] [[Demetr—ñus]] the Neomartyr (Greek: [[ŒÜ]] [[Œ≥ŒπŒøœÇ]] ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ [[ŒùŒµŒøŒºŒ¨œÅœÑœÖœÅ]] [[Œ±œÇ]], or [[ŒÜŒ≥ŒπœÇ]] ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œü ŒùŒ≠ŒøœÇ) is an [[Catholicism]] [[Cristiana]] saint, commemorated on 14 April in the [[Churches]] of Greece.
