"[[On]] 20 [[October]] [[1990]], [[Manchester]] United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a [[Football]] League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. [[Arsenal]] won by a single goal, but the game was best [[remembered]] for a [[brawl]] between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of [[deducting]] league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. [[Arsenal]] were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"[[The]] [[2011]] [[Asturian]] parliamentary [[election]] was [[held]] on [[Sunday]], 22 [[May]] 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias. At stake were all 45 seats in the General Junta, determining the President of the Principality of Asturias. Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' [[Party]] (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. [[The]] FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco √Ålvarez Cascos, former Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as PP's candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente √Ålvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture voting of √Ålvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration. The resulting [[government]], however, was not able to gather legislative support to approve its 2012 [[regional]] budget, with both PP and PSOE blocking the vote, resulting in a fresh election being held in March 2012.","[[Te]] [[201]] [[Asturi]] [[an]] parliamentary [[elect—ñon]] was [[he‚Öºd]] on [[Sunda—É]], 22 [[My]] 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966.

Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions.

"[[3070]] Aitken, [[provisional]] [[designation]] [[1949]] GK, is a stony Flora [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana [[Asteroid]] Program of Indiana University at [[Goethe]] Link Observatory in Brooklyn. [[The]] S-type asteroid is a member of the [[Flora]] [[family]], one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 [[days]]).

The used first [[precovery]] was taken at [[Turku]] Observatory in 1942, extending the [[asteroid's]] observation [[arc]] by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the [[asteroid]] was already imaged in [[1907]], at [[Taunton]] in Massachusetts ([[803]]). A rotational light-curve of this [[asteroid]] was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November [[2010]]. The light-curve gave a rotation period of 6.3965¬±0.[[0026]] hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.38 in magnitude (U=2).

From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938.

Artists who recorded on Perfect included Gene Autry, Annette Hanshaw, Willard Robison, Al Bernard, Big Bill Broonzy, Cab Calloway, Vernon Dalhart, Walter Dalton, Morton Downey, Cliff \""Ukulele Ike\"" Edwards, Lee Morse, The Ponce Sisters, Tito Schipa, and Boyd Senter, as well as scores of records by many of the New York area orchestras and studio groups of the day. From the start, Perfect Records were popular and sold well. The Pathe and Perfect labels were part of the merger that created the American Record Corporation (ARC) in July 1929. After the merger, ARC weeded out some of their poorer selling labels (Pathe, for example), and Perfect continued to be a popular label through the 1930s until ARC dropped their entire group of cheaper labels in late 1938. The label was revived in 1993 by Dean Blackwood and issued recordings pressed on 78 r.p.m. vinyl by Sun City Girls, Charlie Feathers, Junior Kimbrough, The Balfa Brothers, and John Fahey.",0

"[[Weyerbacher]] Brewing [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well [[known]] for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their [[brews]] are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

This work provided evidence that supported the Big Bang theory of the universe: that the CMB was a near-perfect black-body spectrum and that it had very faint anisotropies.

"Federal [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats. Voter [[turnout]] was 75.6%. The only two parties to gain significantly were the SPD, who polled almost a third of votes, and the Communist Party of Germany, completing a thorough victory of the left-wing. However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann M√ºller. Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, M√ºller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the [[elections]] after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag. This was due to the fact that Hitler, who had been incarcerated in Landsberg prison for his involvement in the Beer Hall Putsch until Christmas 1924, concentrated on re-establishing himself as the leader of the party following his release, rather than its electability.","Federal [[el–µctions]] were [[he‚Öºd]] in Germany on 20 May 1928.

"[[The]] [[Lackawanna]] [[Cut-Off]] (also [[known]] as the New Jersey [[Cut-Off]] or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the Delaware, [[Lackawanna]] & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""[[super-railroad]]\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that [[time]]. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction ‚Äî near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City ‚Äî to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a [[subsidiary]], Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the [[Lackawanna's]] 1960 merger with the [[Erie]] Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in [[1976]]. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

"[[The]] [[1904]]‚Äì05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football [[Club's]] [[13th]] in the Football [[League]] and their 5th in the First [[Division]]. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904‚Äì05 FA [[Cup]], entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In [[locally]] organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally [[organised]] first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"".

In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904‚Äì05 FA [[C]] [[up]], entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In [[‚Öºocally]] organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally [[organisd]] first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"".

LeMieux, a placeholder who did not run in the election, replaced [[Mart√≠nez]] in the Senate on September 10, 2009. Crist publicly announced he was running for the seat in mid-2009. When he declared his candidacy, he received many Republican endorsements, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Mart√≠nez, and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. However, his support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 hurt his popularity among conservatives, and Tea Party candidate Marco Rubio, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, surged in the polls. In April 2010, Crist announced he would drop out of the Republican primary and run as an Independent.

Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36‚Äì50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha.

Medieval Western Christianity identified Mary of Bethany with Mary Magdalene and with the sinful woman of Luke 7:36‚Äì50. This influenced the Roman Rite liturgy of the feast of Mary Magdalene, with a Gospel reading about the sinful woman and a collect referring to Mary of Bethany. Since the 1969 revision of that liturgy, Mary Magdalene's feast day continues to be on 22 July, but Mary of Bethany is celebrated, together with her brother Lazarus, on 29 July, the memorial of their sister Martha. In Eastern Christianity and some Protestant traditions, Mary of Bethany and Mary Magdalene are considered separate people. The Orthodox Church has its own traditions regarding Mary of Bethany's life beyond the gospel accounts.",0

"[[Nikolas]] Cassadine is a [[fictional]] [[character]] from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network. Originated by actor Tyler Christopher in 1996, he left the show on July 14, 1999. Due to Nikolas' importance on the soap, he was immediately replaced by Coltin Scott on July 20, 1999. Scott left the role on April 16, 2003, as Christopher made his return on April 21, 2003. Christopher vacated the role on July 28, 2011, after he was let go from the series. Christopher once again reprised the role on a recurring basis in honor of the soaps' fiftieth anniversary; he was later upgraded to a series regular. Actor Nick Stabile took claim of the role in June 2016 in Christopher's absence. Created by head-writers Robert Guza, Jr. and Karen Harris and introduced by executive producer Wendy Riche in 1996 as the illegitimate son of Laura Spencer, the character was immediately popular with audiences. Hailed by Soap Opera Digest as the \""Best New Male Character\"" in 1996, Nikolas's arrival immediately implodes the supercouple of Luke and Laura's happy life with their children, Lucky and Lulu. Luke immediately despises Nikolas due to his Cassadine heritage despite Nikolas saving an ailing Lulu's life. The misunderstood Nikolas is forced to grow up when his paternity comes into question and he is led to believe that his uncle Stefan is his father, as opposed to the late Stavros. Nikolas spends majority of his life trying to get out from under his family's treachery and become his own man. In addition to other romances, Nikolas is most known for his widely popular romance with Emily Quartermaine. Nikolas also has a son, Spencer named in honor of the Spencer family. The character was written out in 2011 following his disastrous affair with Lucky's longtime love, Elizabeth Webber. The character's 2013 return features the return of his biological father Stavros, and the ending of the war between the Cassadine and Spencer families. Nikolas also vies for Elizabeth's affection with A. J. Quartermaine, and later befriends Dr. Britt Westbourne.","[[Nikol…ës]] Cassadine is a [[fiction…ël]] [[œ≤haracter]] from General Hospital, an American soap opera on the ABC network.

Prior to Newcastle's round [[4]] games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the [[club]] was under significant financial stress.

After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place.

"DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was [[designed]] as a standard side-scrolling [[beat'em]] up [[game]] partially based on the [[hip-hop]] culture of the U.S. cities. [[What]] made the [[game]] unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters [[rode]] around on [[roller]] [[skates]] rather than walking or running. [[The]] premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking [[part]] of an ultimate fight-race [[known]] as \""Rollergame\"", taking [[place]] in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to [[see]] DJ Boy, but a roller fighter [[gang]] known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs. DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points).

"Age of Electric is a Canadian hard rock [[band]] founded in 1989 with members from Lanigan and Regina, Saskatchewan. The members are singer/[[guitarist]] Todd Kerns, guitarist Ryan Dahle, bassist John Kerns and drummer Kurt Dahle. Ryan and Kurt also provide backing vocals. AOE were a commercially [[successful]] Canadian rock [[band]] of the mid-90s. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995. In 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with their side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada. The band then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997. The album produced the radio rock hit \""Remote Control\"", which peaked at No. 9 on Canada's Singles Chart and was later featured on MuchMusic's diamond certified compilation album, Big Shiny Tunes 2. Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1998 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace. Upon the break-up of Age of Electric, the brothers Kerns would go on to form Static in Stereo with other members including their brother Ryan. Kurt Dahle went on to work with The New Pornographers.

"[[Radio]] [[Trinidad]] was the oldest radio [[station]] in Trinidad and Tobago. It began [[broadcasting]] in 1947 at [[11B]] [[Maraval]] [[Road]] in Port of Spain on the [[frequency]] [[730]] AM.

The [[station's]] [[announcers]] included [[June]] [[Gonsalves]], Barbara Assoon, Glen Antoine, Sam [[Ghany]], Ken Laughlin, [[Hugh]] Blackman, Larry Heywood, Val Douglas, Russell Winston, Trevor McDonald, Holly [[Betaudier]], Peter [[Minshall]], Don Proudfoot, Bob Gittens and Raffie Knowles. Two of the most [[popular]] programmes were: \n*  Sunday Serenade, a show that featured [[performers]] of the [[day]] including the Mighty Sparrow and Ken Hutcheon), broadcast at noon on Sundays [[co-hosted]] by Bob [[Gittens]] and Sam Ghany. \n*  Auntie [[Kay]], a [[children's]] talent show named after its presenter Kathleen Davis, which ran on Sundays at 2 p.m. and was [[sponsored]] by the [[Bermudez]] [[Biscuit]] Company.
