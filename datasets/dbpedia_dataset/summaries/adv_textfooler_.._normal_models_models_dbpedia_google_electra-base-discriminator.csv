She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the [[Rattlesnake]] (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[mannequin]] [[idiosyncrasies]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes.

One trail, leaving from the town of New Russia, is about a ten-mile round trip with a few, steep rock scrambles along the way.

"The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously [[known]] as the [[Million]] Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional [[golf]] [[tournament]] [[played]] at the Gary Player [[Country]] [[Club]] in Sun City, North West province, [[South]] [[Africa]].

"3043 [[San]] [[Diego]], provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

The bright E-type [[asteroid]] is a member of the Hungaria family, which [[form]] the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the [[Solar]] [[System]]. The [[asteroid]] orbits the Sun at a [[distance]] of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 [[months]] (977 [[days]]).

The first [[observation]] was [[taken]] at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was [[obtained]] from photometric observations by [[U]].[[S]]. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It [[gave]] a [[long]] rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude ([[U]]=0).

"(148209) 2000 CR105, also [[written]] as (148209) 2000 CR105, is the tenth-most-distant known [[object]] in the Solar System as of 2015.

"[[The]] [[Milwaukee]] Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their [[name]] was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. [[These]] four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely [[praised]] by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more [[mainstream]] beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher [[released]] a limited run of a seasonal India [[pale]] ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.
