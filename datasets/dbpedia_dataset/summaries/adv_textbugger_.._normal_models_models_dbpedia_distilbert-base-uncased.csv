"[[On]] [[20]] [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990‚Äì91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs ¬£50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute.

"[[Russells]] Hall [[Hospital]] is an [[NHS]] general [[hospital]] [[located]] in [[Dudley]], West Midlands, [[England]], run by [[The]] [[Dudley]] Group NHS [[Foundation]] [[Trust]]. [[The]] [[hospital]] is [[situated]] south-west of the town [[centre]] on the [[A4101]] road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the [[borough]]. [[It]] was [[first]] planned in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for [[Dudley]] and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's [[hospitals]], and the general [[hospital]] buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March [[1984]], becoming fully operational in May that [[year]]. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and [[emergency]] unit to replace those at the Guest [[Hospital]] in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest [[Hospital]]. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest [[hospitals]], as well as parts of the Corbett [[Hospital]]. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley [[Hospital]] would close [[completely]] and Corbett and [[Dudley]] [[Guest]] would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being [[expanded]] to [[include]] all of the borough's [[in-patient]] [[services]].

Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver [[algo]] [[dist]] [[inctly]] harder edged\"".",0

"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 ‚Äì February 3, 1971) was an [[American]] 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief architect for Eastern College. He was a prot√©g√© of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

Elections are scheduled to be held once every four years, normally on the first Saturday of October. The most recent elections were held in October 2014. The President of Latvia can dismiss the Saeima and request early elections. The procedure for dismissing it involves substantial political risk to the president, including a risk of loss of office. On May 28, 2011, president Valdis Zatlers decided to initiate the dissolution of the Saeima, which was approved in a referendum, and the Saeima was dissolved on 23 July 2011. The current Speaker of the Saeima is InƒÅra M≈´rniece. Deputies are elected to represent one of five constituencies: Kurzeme (13 deputies), Latgale (15), Riga (30), Vidzeme (27), and Zemgale (15). Seats are distributed in each constituency by open list proportional representation among the parties that overcome a 5% national election threshold using an unmodified version of the Sainte-Lagu√´ method.",0
"[[3070]] Aitken, provisional designation 1949 GK, is a [[stony]] [[Flora]] [[asteroid]] from the [[inner]] regions of the [[asteroid]] [[belt]], about 4 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. [[It]] was [[discovered]] on 4 April 1949, by the [[U]].[[S]]. [[Indiana]] [[Asteroid]] [[Program]] of [[Indiana]] University at [[Goethe]] [[Link]] [[Observatory]] in Brooklyn. [[The]] S-type [[asteroid]] is a member of the [[Flora]] [[family]], [[one]] of the [[largest]] groups of stony [[asteroids]] in the [[main-belt]]. [[It]] [[orbits]] the Sun at a [[distance]] of [[1]].[[9]]‚Äì[[2]].[[8]] AU once [[every]] [[3]] [[years]] and [[6]] [[months]] ([[1]],[[279]] [[days]]). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an [[eccentricity]] of [[0]].[[20]] and an [[inclination]] of 2¬∞ with respect to the [[plane]] of the [[ecliptic]]. The used [[first]] precovery was taken at Turku [[Observatory]] in [[1942]], extending the [[asteroid's]] [[observation]] arc by 7 [[years]] prior to its [[discovery]]. However, the asteroid was already [[imaged]] in 1907, at Taunton in [[Massachusetts]] (803). [[A]] rotational [[light-curve]] of this asteroid was obtained from [[photometric]] [[observations]] made at the U.[[S]]. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010. [[The]] light-curve gave a rotation period of 6.3965¬±0.0026 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.38 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid [[Lightcurve]] Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 3.9 kilometers. The minor planet was named for of [[American]] astronomer Robert Grant [[Aitken]] (1864‚Äì1951), who was the 4th director of the Lick Observatory from 1930 to 1935, successor of director William Campbell, after whom the minor planet 2751 Campbell was named.

"Pandora (/[[p√¶nÀàd…î…ôr…ô]]/ pan-DOHR-…ô; Greek: Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œéœÅŒ±) is an inner [[satellite]] of Saturn.

Pandora was thought to be an [[outer]] shepherd [[satellite]] of the F [[Ring]].

It is more heavily [[cratered]] than [[nearby]] Prometheus, and has at [[least]] [[two]] large [[craters]] 30 [[kilometres]] (19 mi) in [[diameter]]. [[The]] majority of [[craters]] on [[Pandora]] are shallow as a result of being [[filled]] with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's [[surface]]. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of [[four]] 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their [[orbits]] occur approximately [[every]] 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the [[apoapsis]] of Prometheus and the moons approach to [[within]] about [[1]],400 [[kilometres]] (870 mi). [[Pandora]] also has a [[3]]:[[2]] [[mean-motion]] [[resonance]] with Mimas. From its very low [[density]] and [[relatively]] high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy [[body]].

"[[In]] [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost.

The story focuses on the character, Masafumi Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream.

"The Word is an [[American]] instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The [[supergroup]] includes [[well-known]] musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John [[Medeski]] (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi [[Allstars-]] Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and [[ex-North]] Mississippi [[Allstars]] bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi [[Allstars]], both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a [[then-unknown]] Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel [[bands]], with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and [[sing-song]] preaching that often [[accompanies]] such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by [[Medeski]], is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut [[self-titled]] album, produced by Medeski and released on [[Ropeadope]] Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.

"The Reform [[movement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs. However, organized Reform activity emerged in the 1830s when Reformers, like Robert Randal, Jesse Ketchum, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, and Dr. William Warren Baldwin, began to emulate the organizational forms of the British Reform Movement, and organized Political Unions under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie. The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system. Those who adopted these new forms of public mobilization for democratic reform in Upper Canada were inspired by the more radical Owenite Socialists who led the British Chartist and Mechanics Institute movements.","The Reform [[displacement]] was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues.

"The 1904‚Äì[[05]] Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football [[Club's]] [[13th]] in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh.

In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this [[season]], the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"".

In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904‚Äì05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this [[seasonal]], the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"".

"The [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a [[natural]] [[landslide]] [[dam]] along the [[Murghab]] [[River]] in Tajikistan. At [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] [[ft]]) high, it is the tallest [[dam]] in the world, [[either]] [[natural]] or man-made.

It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the [[1911]] landslide. [[The]] [[dam]] rises to a height of 500 to 700 [[metres]] (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the [[original]] [[valley]] floor.

"[[The]] Basque [[conflict]], also known as the Spain‚ÄìETA [[conflict]], was an armed and political [[conflict]] between Spain and the Basque National Liberation Movement, a group of social and political Basque organizations which sought independence from Spain and France.
