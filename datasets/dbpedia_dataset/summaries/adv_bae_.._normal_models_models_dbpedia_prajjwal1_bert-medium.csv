The team logo was unveiled in February 1998 and the Canadian brothers Dave Berryman and Tim Berryman were granted a lease for Alltel Arena in March. The ECHL franchise was granted in May 1998. The team was originally named the \""Arkansas RazorBlades\"" and adopted a razorback hog as its mascot. The University of Arkansas objected to the name and symbology and pressed the team to finally agree to a name change. In October 1998, a contest was held to establish a new name and \""RiverBlades\"" was chosen. In May 1999, the team selected the slogan \""Greatest Game on Ice\"". Little Rock's minor league baseball team, the Arkansas Travelers, objected to the slogan which is similar to their long standing \""Greatest Game on Dirt\"" slogan. The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season.

The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team.

The RiverBlades played their home opener on October 28, 1999, after moving the date due to construction delays at ALLTEL Arena. The RiverBlades would compete with the cross-town Arkansas GlacierCats who were also in their first season. The two teams played on the same nights in many cases and each developed their own fan following. The next year the GlacierCats would fold, unable to compete with the RiverBlades and their new home arena.In October 2001 the ECHL approved the sale of Dave Berryman's 51 percent stake of the team to Equity Broadcasting which also owned the Arkansas Twisters arena football team. [[of]] the 2000–2001 season the team hosted the ECHL All-Star game at Alltel Arena. Head coach Jeff Ward. Assistant coach Brad Gratton. In the summer of 2002, the Fayetteville Force, a Central Hockey League team out of North Carolina offered to switch franchises with Berryman who turned the offer down. In early 2003, rumors began to circulate that the RiverBlades would not return for the 2003–2004 season but the company denied the rumors. In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the lease with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely. In July 2009, Alltel Arena officially became Verizon Arena after Verizon Wireless, Inc. purchased Alltel Corp.",0

"Asia are a British progressive rock [[band]]. The band was formed in 1981 as a supergroup of four members from different progressive rock bands: John Wetton (former bassist/vocalist of bands including King Crimson, Family, Roxy Music, Uriah Heep, UK and Wishbone Ash), Steve Howe (guitarist of Yes), Geoff Downes (keyboardist of Yes and The Buggles) and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and Atomic Rooster). With their debut album Asia from 1982 reaching No. 1 in several countries, Asia ranks as one of the most popular progressive rock bands in history. The band has undergone multiple line-up changes during its history, but in 2006, the original line-up reunited. As a result, a band called Asia Featuring John Payne exists as a continuation of John Payne's career as Asia's frontman from 1991 until Wetton's return in 2006. In 2013, Howe retired from the band to continue with Yes and pursue other projects, and was replaced by guitarist Sam Coulson, completing the current lineup.","Asia are a British progressive rock [[album]].

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[Railroad]] (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. [[The]] Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad [[crossings]] at the [[time]] of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into [[Conrail]] in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the [[line]] in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial [[restoration]] to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[company]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western [[railroads]] (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad [[expelled]] Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and [[Turkey]] warmed.

"The 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. They also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league.

"Saint Demetrius the [[Neomartyr]] (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian [[saint]], [[commemorated]] on 14 April in the Church of Greece. Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy [[born]] in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. His mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius left home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a barber. He converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. [[Demetrius]] fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. [[When]] this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. [[Demetrius]] was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, [[convicted]] and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to let him go. Finally, Demetrius was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully sang Christian hymns in his way), and publicly executed by beheading; it took three strokes, and his severed head and body, though ordered to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.","Saint Demetrius the [[wise]] (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian [[holy]], [[written]] on 14 April in the Church of Greece.

"The SM Kirov Stadium was a multi-purpose [[stadium]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The [[stadium]] was named after Sergey Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov stadium was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. [[In]] 1994 the stadium was used as the main arena for the St. Petersburg 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the stadium was used for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit Stadium was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov stadium was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo Moscow at the Kirov stadium because of unavailability of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned deconstruction, so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006. A new stadium (see New Zenit Stadium) is under construction, tentatively scheduled to open in 2016.","The SM Kirov Stadium was a multi-purpose [[venue]] in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the largest stadiums anywhere in the world. The [[event]] was named after Sergey Kirov. The stands of the Kirov stadium were located on the slopes of a circular artificial mound in the western part of Krestovsky Island, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to Leningrad. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as labor force for construction. The stadium was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the stadium held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the stadium to 110,000. The stadium was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football.

"The Newcastle [[Jets]] 2010–11 [[season]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the [[tenth]] since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total. As part of a new initiative called \""Be a part of it\"", the Jets will host a community day, where 10,000 fans will be admitted free for the game against Melbourne Heart on 31 October 2010. A new price structure for tickets includes a free season pass for children younger than 15, a family pass for 11 home games with reserved grandstand for $100 and general admission for $10.

The Jets will have the institute's logo on the front of their jersey and will donate $5000 for every goal they score at home and $2500 for an away goal. The changes continued when the club set up a new administration office, extended the contract of coach Branko Culina until March 2015 and unveiled a $2.5 million blueprint for the football department. The Newcastle Jets announced with the FFA and the State Government, that they would host the Los Angeles Galaxy at Energy Australia Stadium on 27 November. The match, an almost certain sellout, will play host to big name players; David Beckham, and Landon Donovan.","The Newcastle [[jet]] 2010–11 [[edition]] was the Newcastle Jets' sixth season since the inception of the Australian A-League and the [[thirteenth]] since the club's founding, in 2000. It was announced on 22 July 2010 that Michael Bridges would be the Newcastle Jets senior team captain, With Ljubo Miličević to be his deputy. Prior to Newcastle's round 4 games against Brisbane Roar, it was revealed that the club was under significant financial stress. This meant that the club was unable to pay staff and player wages on time. This resulted in the club seeking either a loan or an advance on their quarterly share of the television deal. It was announced by the club and the Football Federation Australia that the governing body would give a short term assistance package, making sure the club made it through their next few games and back into financial viability. After giving Con Constantine every chance to show that he was able to prove financial viability, it was determined by the FFA that the best course of action would be to sell the club to mining magnate and horse owner Nathan Tinkler. In the first few weeks under his ownership Tinkler stated that he wished to give the club back to the community, and he made several key changes to the way the club was run. These changes included appointing an executive chairman in Ken Edwards to run the club while a board of directors and football advisory board were put in place. Tinkler also extended his ownership of the Jets to last until at least 2020. This enabled the club to move forward with a new direction which included resigning manager Branko Culina on a four year contract, and doubling the footballing departments budget from $1.1million to around $2.5million, creating 8 new full-time positions at the club and 15 jobs in total.

"The Fornebu Line (Norwegian: [[Fornebubanen]]) is a proposed rail [[line]] which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. [[The]] [[line]] is in the planning stages and the transit [[agency]] Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. [[The]] [[line]] has at various [[stages]] been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light [[rail]], stadtbahn, rapid [[transit]], bus rapid transit and commuter [[rail]]. The current proposal [[consists]] of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 [[ft]]). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, [[Vækerø]], Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter.

Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State [[Railways]] (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line.

The party is the Sudanese regional branch of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party in Sudan. While the branch has always been small, accounting for an estimated 1,000 members in 2003, it has been able to have a bigger impact than what its meager membership numbers would suggest, mostly due to Iraqi financing of the branch.

"The Arizona League is a minor league baseball [[league]] that operates in and around Phoenix, Arizona. It is a rookie-level league run by Major League Baseball since 1989. Along with the Gulf Coast League, it forms the lowest rung of the minor-league system. Games are not marketed to the general public, and no admission is charged for spectators. Games are played at the spring training complexes of the teams' parent organizations from mid-June until the end of August. Every Cactus League team fields an Arizona League team with the exception of the Colorado Rockies. Night games are commonly played in the spring training stadium, though games may be played at the team's practice fields. The regular season is 56 games, with a 35-player roster limit. Players must not have more than three years of previous minor league experience to be eligible to play. Teams primarily consist of players from the Dominican Republic and recently drafted high school and college players, and are owned by their parent clubs. Most of the players have just been selected in that year's entry draft, two to three weeks before the league begins its season. The league is also where major league players often go for their first rehab assignments. No official attendance records are kept as there is no paid admittance fee, and no concessions are sold. Few spectators show up, and games are typically played in temperatures above 100 °F.","The Arizona League is a minor league baseball [[season]] that operates in and around Phoenix, Arizona.

Bentham [[published]] as the \""fundamental axiom\"" of his philosophy the [[conclusion]] that \""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of [[being]] and wrong\"". [[it]] became a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of [[time]], and a political radical whose ideas influenced the development of [[time]]. [[its]] advocated individual and economic freedom, the separation of [[power]] and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, the [[power]] to divorce, and the decriminalising of homosexual acts. [[it]] [[argues]] for the abolition of slavery, the abolition of the [[rape]] penalty, and the abolition of physical punishment, including that of children. [[it]] has also become known in recent years as an early [[critique]] of animal rights. Though strongly in favour of the extension of individual legal rights, he [[emphasized]] the idea of natural law and natural rights, calling them \""nonsense upon stilts\"". Bentham's [[classmates]] [[encompassed]] his secretary and collaborator James [[mill]], the latter's son, John Stuart Mill, the [[noted]] philosopher John Austin, as well as Robert Owen, one of the founders of utopian [[socialist]].

"Tommaso Salini (1575 – 13 September 1625) was an [[Italian]] [[painter]] of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome. [[He]] is best remembered for defending his friend, Giovanni Baglione, in his libel suit against Caravaggio and other painters in his circle. Baglioni describes his still life paintings. [[He]] joined the Accademia di San Luca in 1605. Salini is a frequently forgotten Baroque artist who fell under the spell of Caravaggio, despite having a tempestuous relationship with the great painter. Salini, also known as Mao, was a friend of Giovanni Baglione, the Italian art biographer, who included Salini in his Le vite de’ pittori. Art historians have often shied away from exploring Salini’s career because the canvases that have carried his name seem stylistically dissimilar. The recent tendency has been to attribute these works to anonymous Pseudo-Salini painters. In order for Salini’s oeuvre to be presented with accuracy, connoisseurs have had to inspect the original works that Baglione mentions as being by Salini’s hand, as well as the pictures that have been successfully attributed to him.","Tommaso Salini (1575 – 13 September 1625) was an [[italian]] [[painting]] of the early-Baroque period, active in Rome.

"Pierre Charles Fournier [[de]] Saint-Amant (12 September 1800 – 29 October 1872) was a leading French chess [[master]] and an editor of the chess periodical Le Palamède. He is best [[known]] for losing a match against Howard Staunton in 1843 that is often considered to have been an unofficial match for the World Chess Championship. [[Saint-Amant]] learned chess from Wilhelm Schlumberger, who later became the operator of The Turk. [[He]] played at the Café de la Régence, where he was a student of Alexandre Deschapelles. For many years he played on level terms with Boncourt, a strong player, and received odds of pawn and two moves from Deschapelles and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais. In 1834–36, he led a Paris team that won both games of a correspondence chess match against the Westminster Club, then England's [[leading]] chess [[club]]. After La Bourdonnais' death in 1840, he was considered the country's best player. In December 1841 he revived Le Palamède (at its [[inception]] in 1836 the world's first chess periodical), which ran until 1847. He played two matches against Staunton in 1843. The first, in London, he won 3½–2½ (three wins, one draw, two losses), but he [[lost]] a return match in Paris just before Christmas 13–8 (six wins, four draws, eleven losses). [[This]] second match is sometimes considered an unofficial world championship match. In 1858, [[Saint-Amant]] played in the Birmingham tournament, a knockout event. He won in the first round, but lost in the second by a 2–1 score to Ernst [[Falkbeer]]. Returning to Paris, he witnessed the adulatory reception [[accorded]] Paul Morphy at the Café de la [[Régence]]. The score of one game between them is known, a 22-move rout by Morphy of Saint-Amant and his consultation partner, given as \""F. de L.\"" or \""F. de L'A\"". Outside of chess, [[Saint-Amant]] became a government clerk in Paris at an early age. [[He]] then served as the secretary to the governor of French Guiana from 1819 to 1821. [[He]] was dismissed from that appointment after he protested against the slave trade that still [[existed]] in that colony. After that, he tried his [[hand]] as a journalist and actor, then became a successful wine [[merchant]]. He was a captain in the French National Guard during the 1848 revolution. [[For]] his [[role]] in saving the Palais des Tuileries from destruction by the mob, he was made its Governor for a few months. In 1851–52, he was the French consul to California. Upon returning to France he spent some years writing well-regarded works on the French colonies, and a treatise on the wines of Bordeaux. In 1861 Saint-Amant retired to Algeria.

On 27 June 2013, the Australian Electoral Commission approved a change in the spelling of the party's name from \""Democratic Labor Party\"" to \""Democratic Labour Party\""—with the party stating that the change reflected the \""correct Australian spelling\"" of the word 'labour', and also differentiated it from the Australian Labor Party. On 23 April 2015 the [[constituency]] was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission for 'failure to demonstrate requisite 500 members to maintain registration'. On 1 March 2016, the Australian Electoral commission upheld an appeal by the DLP against its deregistration and reregistered it. The DLP has proven it has at least 500 members in Victoria alone and is registered with the Victorian Electoral Commission.",0

"The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a nationalist political [[party]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969). The [[party]] was effectively a merger of Unity and the Nationalist Party, as the bulk of activists and councillors from the two movements joined IIP. However several independent councillors also joined the party. It was boosted in the late 1970s by the defection of a prominent Protestant Larne Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) councillor, John Turnley, later the party chairman, who was killed in 1980 in Carnlough, County Antrim, by an attack claimed by the Ulster Defence Association. The party first came to prominence by standing four candidates in the 1979 UK general election. Its best result came in the Mid Ulster constituency where Patrick Fahy captured 12,055 votes (19%), however the main effect was to split the Nationalist vote and prevent the SDLP from gaining the seat. The [[IIP]] continued to grow as it became involved in the campaign to support prisoners in the Maze prison who were \""on the blanket\"" and later hunger strike. The IIP won 21 seats on councils in the local elections of 1981 as a result of its involvement with the campaign, although this support was fairly localised, with 17 of the 21 seats being won in just four councils: Fermanagh, Derry, Omagh and Newry & Mourne. However, for a short period of time it came to be accepted by some as a voice of Irish republicanism (although a number of other groups had similar but smaller localised support, with both the People's Democracy and the Irish Republican Socialist Party securing two seats each in Belfast at the same election). The [[IIP]] boycotted the Assembly elections in October 1982, [[leaving]] the field clear for Sinn Féin, who began standing candidates in elections in the early [[1980s]]. As a result, the IIP lost republican support, for example in the first by-election in which Sinn Féin stood, in Omagh in 1983, the IIP were only able to poll 5% in a seat that they had held, while the Sinn Féin candidate took 60%. Meantime moderate nationalists had remained with the SDLP. The [[party]] remained active until at least 1985, when it had four councillors elected in local council elections, but appears to have been disbanded before the next local elections in 1989.","The Irish Independence Party (IIP) was a nationalist political [[campaign]] in Northern Ireland, founded in October 1977 by Frank McManus (former Unity MP for Fermanagh & South Tyrone between 1970 and 1974) and Fergus McAteer (son of Eddie McAteer, who had been leader of the Nationalist Party between 1953 and 1969).

It was manufactured by Aeronutronics. At beginning of life, it generates nearly 10 kilowatts. This version takes advantage of such advances as dual-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, new battery technology and the first commercial use of a high-efficiency xenon ion propulsion system (XIPS).

Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time.

"The Hobart Private Hospital is a 146 bed private [[hospital]] located in the central business district of Hobart adjacent to the Royal Hobart Hospital. It is owned by [[Healthscope]], one of Australia's leading providers of hospitals, medical and pathology centres. [[The]] Hobart Private [[Hospital]] provides private health [[care]] specialising in the areas of emergency, cardiac, maternity, orthopaedics, gastroenterology, urology, plastic and [[reconstructive]] surgery, respiratory medicine, rehab and general surgery. History-The Hobart Private [[Hospital]] was established in 1999 following the Government of Tasmania's decision to privatise the Queen Alexandria maternity [[wing]] attached to the Royal Hobart Hospital. Many were opposed to the privatisation of the wing, but it was a policy agenda of Tony Rundle's Liberal [[Party]] (in power 1996-1998) to privatise the bulk of Tasmania's public infrastructure. Australian Hospital Care Limited purchased the [[site]] following the sale of the Queen Alexandra wing in 1999, but soon found themselves compulsorily purchased by Mayne Nickless Limited (now Mayne Group Limited). Despite the Liberal Party's determination to make their policy of [[privatisation]] of public infrastructure work, the private sector in Hobart, which is a relatively small market, was already well served by Calvary Hospital, St Johns Calvary [[Hospital]] and [[St]] Helens Private Hospital, and Hobart Private was experiencing financial difficulties within months of [[opening]]. Despite frequent requests from the board of the Royal Hobart Hospital to the Tasmanian [[Government]] for them to reacquire the [[site]] in order that the RHH could make [[much]] need expansions, the owners of Hobart Private refused to sell [[unless]] all three of their Tasmanian Hospitals were bought in one package. By 2001 Healthscope had bought Hobart Private from Mayne Health, and through shrewd management made it profitable. The Royal continued to apply [[pressure]] on the government to buy the [[site]], as they were becoming desperate to expand, but Healthscope, now turning a profit, rejected it out of hand. Also the increasing need to turn profit for shareholders led to a reduction of service provision, and the Liberal's grand vision of a private sector which would solve all of the government's healthcare problems was falling apart. In 2005 premier Paul Lennon again requested the return of the [[site]] in order to aid the desperate need for the Royal's [[redevelopment]], but the request was again flatly refused by Healthscope. By June 2005, the Hbart Private was having problems with accreditiation and facilities management, and even had to be evacuated due to flooding. By August 2005 the Hobart Private Hospital had been flagged by Australia's national healthcare standards organisation as one of 26 hospitals nationally that was failing to meet required standards, however this report was claimed to be misrepresentative by Healthscope's chief medical officer, Michael Coglin.","The Hobart Private Hospital is a 146 bed private [[company]] located in the central business district of Hobart adjacent to the Royal Hobart Hospital.

"Michele Tosini (1503–1577) was an [[Italian]] [[painter]] of the Renaissance and Mannerist period, who [[worked]] in Florence.

After 1556, Tosini [[served]] as an assistant to Giorgio Vasari in the [[decoration]] of the Salone dei Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.

"Cape Horn (Dutch: , Spanish: Cabo de Hornos), named after the city of Hoorn in the [[Netherlands]], is the southernmost [[headland]] of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of [[southern]] Chile, and is [[located]] on the small Hornos [[Island]]. Although not the most southerly point of South America (which are the Diego Ramírez Islands), Cape Horn marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans collide. For [[decades]] it was a major milestone on the clipper route, by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and Icebergs; these dangers have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard. The need for ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to [[visit]] Horn [[Island]], or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point). Several prominent ocean [[yacht]] races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the VELUX 5 Oceans, and the Vendée Globe, [[sail]] [[around]] the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route. There have been a number of small boat roundings of the [[Horn]] but one in particular stands out: Howard Rice sailed and paddled a 15-foot (4.6 m) wood canvas folding canoe doubling the Horn. [[In]] 1987 The British Cape Horn [[Expedition]], headed by Nigel H Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing [[kayaks']] called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing [[positions]] between the two kayaks.","Cape Horn (Dutch: , Spanish: Cabo de Hornos), named after the city of Hoorn in the [[dutch]], is the southernmost [[region]] of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago of [[south]] Chile, and is [[set]] on the small Hornos [[islands]].

The need for ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. Sailing around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to [[point]] Horn [[islands]], or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point). Several prominent ocean [[side]] races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the VELUX 5 Oceans, and the Vendée Globe, [[sailed]] [[alongside]] the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route. There have been a number of small boat roundings of the [[horns]] but one in particular stands out: Howard Rice sailed and paddled a 15-foot (4.6 m) wood canvas folding canoe doubling the Horn. [[of]] 1987 The British Cape Horn [[race]], headed by Nigel H Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing [[regatta]] called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing [[boats]] between the two kayaks.",2
