"The [[2011]] [[Asturian]] parliamentary [[election]] was [[held]] on [[Sunday]], 22 May 2011, to elect the 8th [[General]] Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous [[community]] of Asturias.

Originating as a School of Commerce, which was established in 1925 to offer B.A. and B.Comm. degrees in Trinity College, the School was transformed into a School of Business Studies in the 1960s. It is located in the Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences of Trinity College. Established in 1964, its MBA is one of the three original MBA programmes in Europe. In 1976, the M.Sc. (Mgmt) degree in Management Practice for practising senior executives was launched, with a curriculum based on action research principles. In 2015 Trinity Business School embarked on a high growth strategy that will more than double the size of the School and includes the development of new and existing programmes, as well as the construction of a cutting-edge building for the School (that will incorporate an Innovation and Entrepreneurship hub). The new business complex will open up onto Pearse Street on one side, helping to reinvigorate that street, and overlook the iconic Trinity rugby field on the other. The project is expected to be completed by early 2019. In the meantime, Trinity Business School is located on two sites, one at Aras an Phairsaigh, within the main Trinity campus and another at 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2. In 2015 and 2016 it began rolling out a series of pre-experience masters and advanced diploma programs in support of this growth plan",0

"[[Russells]] [[Hall]] Hospital is an [[NHS]] general hospital located in [[Dudley]], West [[Midlands]], [[England]], run by The Dudley [[Group]] NHS Foundation [[Trust]]. [[The]] hospital is situated [[south-west]] of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. [[It]] was first planned in the [[1960s]] as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding [[area]]. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the [[borough's]] [[hospitals]], and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. [[The]] new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in [[Stourbridge]]. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for [[Russells]] Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest [[hospitals]], as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen [[Wordsley]] Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time [[Russells]] Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999. Cricketer Ian Botham, famous for his charity work, opened a state of the art leukaemia unit at the hospital in 1998.

"[[The]] Milwaukee Does were a [[team]] in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball [[League]]. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their name was a play on that of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971. [[The]] league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league's inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night's CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy DeBoer and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points.

"[[90377]] Sedna is a large minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as [[far]] as Neptune. Spectroscopy has [[revealed]] that Sedna's surface composition is similar to that of some other trans-Neptunian [[objects]], being largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. [[Its]] [[surface]] is [[one]] of the reddest among Solar System [[objects]]. [[It]] is most likely a [[dwarf]] planet. For most of its orbit, it is even farther from the Sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at 937 AU (31 times Neptune's distance), making it [[one]] of the most distant known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets. Sedna has an exceptionally [[long]] and elongated orbit, taking [[approximately]] 11,400 years to complete and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76 AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places [[Sedna]] in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune.

"[[Federal]] [[elections]] were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May [[1928]]. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the [[Reichstag]] after winning 153 of the 491 seats.

However, although the SPD now had 153 seats, they still failed to gain a clear majority, resulting in another coalition government led by Hermann Müller.

The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers. When Hindenburg refused, Müller resigned, marking the end of the 'last genuinely democratic government of the Weimar Republic' on 27 March 1930. The recently reformed Nazi Party contested the elections after the ban on the party was lifted in 1925. However, the party received less than 3% of the vote and won just 12 seats in the Reichstag.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] ([[also]] [[known]] as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. [[The]] line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The [[Cut-Off]] ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual [[operation]] for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna [[Cut-Sff]] ([[alos]] [[konwn]] as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[lLne]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"[[The]] men's [[single]] [[sculls]] competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia [[took]] [[place]] at the Sydney International Regatta Centre. [[This]] rowing [[event]] is a single scull [[event]], meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). [[The]] competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The winning boat in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages. The repechages offered the rowers a chance to qualify for the semi-final.
