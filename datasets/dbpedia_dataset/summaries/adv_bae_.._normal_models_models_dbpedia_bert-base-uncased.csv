"[[On]] 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf [[Challenge]], previously [[known]] as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf [[tournament]] [[played]] at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, [[South]] Africa. Originally it was not an official money [[event]] for any of the major tours, but it became an [[official]] tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. [[Like]] [[many]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes [[place]] between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in [[early]] [[November]], and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. [[The]] tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play [[event]], with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine [[Tour]] order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World [[Golf]] Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the [[tournament]] carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999.

In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the [[field]]. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. The 2016 [[event]] will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available players from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The [[remainder]] of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years winner of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations. From 2010 to 2012, a separate tournament for senior golfers was [[held]] [[concurrently]] and called the Nedbank Champions Challenge.","[[the]] Nedbank Golf [[challenges]], previously [[sold]] as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf [[course]] [[established]] at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, [[southeast]] Africa. Originally it was not an official money [[events]] for any of the major tours, but it became an [[accepted]] tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. [[in]] [[certain]] high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes [[years]] between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in [[late]] [[years]], and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. [[every]] tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play [[course]], with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine [[champion]] order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World [[club]] Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the [[venue]] carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan [[pga]] Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first [[laureate]] was increased to US$2 million, but the [[coming]] year the winner's share of the total prize [[endowment]] was reduced from more than half to [[about]] 30%. The standard winner's share on the [[pga]] [[tours]] is 18% and on the European [[toured]] it is 16.67%.

"Dark [[Discoveries]] is an internationally distributed, quarterly slick [[magazine]] formerly published by Dark Discoveries Publications, and now published by [[Journalstone]], LLC. [[It]] [[focuses]] [[primarily]] on the horror fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction [[genres]].

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish [[prelate]] best known for involvement in a dispute with the [[Pope]]. [[His]] Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His [[origins]] are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or [[simultaneously]] appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 [[December]] 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the [[Bishop]] of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the [[Convention]] of Birgham in 1290. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam [[granted]] the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal [[residence]] at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland. He died on 9 December 1298.","Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish [[bishopric]] best known for involvement in a dispute with the [[pope]].

A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the [[diocese]] of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the [[convention]] of Birgham in 1290. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam [[ceded]] the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal [[place]] at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland. He died on 9 December 1298.",0

"3070 Aitken, provisional designation 1949 GK, is a stony Flora [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was discovered on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana Asteroid Program of Indiana University at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn. The S-type [[asteroid]] is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic.

"The George P. Coleman Memorial [[Bridge]] (known locally as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double swing [[bridge]] that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. The bridge is the only public crossing of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) at just above its source at West Point. Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current 3,750-foot (1,140 m)-long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial highway. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy's Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost 90 feet (27 m) above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world. The toll [[bridge]] was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to 1922 was the head of the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The bridge has been one of the sites of a special program to establish and encourage nesting locations for the peregrine falcon population of Virginia. The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge is a toll facility. Tolls are only collected northbound, and are used to pay for the expansion of the bridge to four lanes. Toll Collection Rates are as follows: \n* Commuters (E-ZPass required) 85¢ \n* Motorcycles 85¢ \n* Two-axle vehicles $2 \n* Three-axle vehicles $3 \n* Four- or more-axle vehicles $4 Bicycles are permitted to cross and are not required to pay a toll.

"The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[band]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the [[band]] is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \""Deadheads\"". \""Their music,\"" writes Lenny Kaye, \""touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\"" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\"". The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of all Time issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide. The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), Ron \""Pigpen\"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts. And some members of the band started touring as Dead & Company in 2015. There have also been several spin-offs featuring band members, such as Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Hart and Kreutzmann.","The Grateful Dead was an American rock [[album]] formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail line, built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna Cut-Off (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[system]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

"[[Turkey]], whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his [[departure]] from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar [[Assad's]] father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the [[beginning]] of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations. Together with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Turkey has also provided the rebels with arms and other military equipment. Tensions between Syria and Turkey significantly worsened after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish fighter jet in June 2012, and border clashes erupted in October 2012. On 24 August 2016, the Turkish armed forces began a declared direct military intervention into Syria pursuing as targets both ISIL and the Kurdish-aligned forces in Syria. Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change, and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad. Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been trying to \""cultivate a favorable relationship with whatever government would take the place of Assad.\"" Beginning in May 2012, some Syrian opposition fighters began being armed and trained by the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation.

The Tomb is guarded by a small permanent garrison of Turkish soldiers, who continue to rotate in from a battalion based at the Turkish border some 25 kilometres (16 mi) away, even as the civil war unfolded around them. Up until Syrian forces shot down a Turkish warplane in June 2012, the garrison numbered 15 men in total. Following the incident, the Turkish government doubled the number of soldiers stationed at the tomb to 30, while then-Prime Minister Erdoğan warned that \""the tomb of Suleyman Shah and the land that surrounds it are Turkish territory.

Since the MAC was a non-automatic qualifying (non-AQ) conference, its conference champion had to finish 16th or higher in the BCS ranking and be ranked ahead of at least one AQ conference champion to qualify for a BCS game. With their MAC Championship, the Huskies moved to No. 15 in the final Bowl Championship Series rankings, while Big East champion [[Louisville]] was ranked No. 21. As a result, Northern Illinois received a BCS bid to the Orange Bowl against Florida State.

"The Hammersmith & City [[line]] of the London Underground runs between Hammersmith and Barking. Coloured salmon pink on the tube map, it serves 29 stations in 15.8 miles (25.5 km). It runs below ground in the central section between Paddington and Bow Road; between Farringdon and Aldgate East it skirts the City of London, the capital's financial heart. The tunnels are just below the surface and are a similar size to those on British main lines. Most of the track and all stations are shared with the District, Circle or Metropolitan lines, the other parts of London Underground's sub-surface railway, and over 114 million passenger journeys are made each year on this line and the Circle line. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway began the world's first underground railway service between Paddington and Farringdon with wooden carriages and steam locomotives. The following year, a railway west from Paddington to Hammersmith was opened and this soon became operated and owned jointly by the Metropolitan and Great Western railways. The line was then extended to the east, in stages, reaching the East London Railway in 1884. The line was electrified in 1906, and, in 1936, after the Metropolitan Railway had been absorbed by London Passenger Transport Board, some Hammersmith & City trains were extended over the former District Railway line to Barking. The Hammersmith & City route was shown on the tube map as part of the Metropolitan line until 1990, since when it has appeared as a separate line.

"The Oregon Trunk Rail [[Bridge]] or Celilo Bridge is a single-track railroad [[bridge]] opened in 1912 over the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the [[United]] [[States]]. [[It]] consists of eight steel truss spans and several deck girder [[spans]], and since 1957 it has included a vertical-lift section. [[The]] bridge was [[designed]] by engineer Ralph Modjeski and erected by the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co., of Leavenworth, Kansas. [[It]] is part of the Wishram, Washington to Bend, Oregon [[line]] of the BNSF Railway (formerly the Oregon Trunk [[line]] of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle [[Railway]]). [[The]] bridge is downstream of the site of Celilo Falls, now submerged by water impounded by [[The]] Dalles Dam. The Celilo Canal passed beneath the southernmost [[span]], which was a swing span. Completion of The Dalles Dam in 1957 inundated the [[canal]]. [[Over]] a period of several months starting in October 1956, the bridge was [[raised]] by up to 5 feet (1.5 m) over its entire [[length]], and the truss span to the north of the swing [[span]] was modified to a vertical-lift-type span for river [[navigation]]. The new lift span's first complete raising and lowering [[took]] place on June 21, 1957, and the [[bridge]] reopened to rail traffic the following day. The swing [[span]], to the south of the lift span, [[remains]] in place, but it [[ceased]] to be used after the lift span was installed. [[It]] was \""permanently locked in place\"" in October 1956, for the [[start]] of work to modify the bridge. All of the bridge's [[piers]] rest on rocks that were normally exposed during low water periods. [[During]] periods of [[high]] water, this stretch of the Columbia [[River]] [[became]] raging rapids, so the piers were built during low water. [[The]] north end of the [[bridge]] is a wye, where the [[rail]] line from Bend meets the BNSF Portland to Pasco mainline.

"The Fornebu [[Line]] (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway. The line is in the planning stages and the transit agency Ruter is working towards connecting it to the Oslo Metro. The line has at various stages been proposed as a automated people mover, tram-train, tramway, light rail, stadtbahn, rapid transit, bus rapid transit and commuter rail. The current proposal consists of a metro line starting at Majorstuen Station and running entirely in a tunnel for 8,150 meters (26,740 ft). It would possible have a station at Madserud, and then stations at Skøyen, Vækerø, Lysaker, Telenor Arena, Flytårnet and Fornebu Senter. A depot would be built at Fornebu and the line would connect to the metro's Common Tunnel at Majorstuen. Plans for a light rail to Fornebu were first launched in 1919, but at the time there was not the population to support it. Oslo Airport, Fornebu opened in 1939, and from the 1980s the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) proposed serving it with a branch of the Drammen Line. A 1986 report from said agency also looked at a people mover to a proposed new terminal. In 1992 Parliament voted to close the airport and build Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Fornebu closed in 1998 and the area was to enter into a period of redevelopment. However, the zoning plans state that full-scale development of 6,000 residences and between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs cannot take place until a rail transit has been established. After discarding proposals for a railway and a tram-train, Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead opted for a connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the site be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. The project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed schedule for construction.","The Fornebu [[system]] (Norwegian: Fornebubanen) is a proposed rail line which would serve the peninsula of Fornebu in Bærum, Norway.

"The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[play]]. Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.","The Somonyng of Everyman (The Summoning of Everyman), usually referred to simply as Everyman, is a late 15th-century morality [[playwright]].

He took over the archeparchy after the murder of Paulos Faraj [[Rahho]] in early 2008. Nona, an ethnic Assyrian, was born in [[Alqosh]] in 1967. After completing his secondary education in 1985, he entered the Chaldean Patriarchal Seminary and was ordained priest on 11 January 1991 in Baghdad. From 1993 to 1997 he was parochial vicar at Alqosh, then pastor until 2000. He then enrolled at the Pontifical Lateran University. In 2005 he obtained a doctorate in theology and returned home. From 2005 he served as a professor of anthropology at the Babel College. Later, he was named vicar general of the Chaldean Catholic eparchy (diocese) of Alqosh. He speaks Syriac, Arabic, Italian, and knows English. On May 5, 2009, the Synod of Bishops of the Chaldean Catholic Church elected Nona archeparch of Mosul of the Chaldeans.

He was ordained a bishop on 8 January 2010, with Mar Emmanuel III Delly, patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans, as principal consecrator. At the age of 42, he was the youngest Catholic archbishop in the world. Speaking on the violence in Iraq in 2014 Archeparch Nona said, all the Christians who were still living there have now fled. Nona, corroborated this while speaking with the worldwide Catholic relief service Aid to the Church in Need. “All the faithful have left the city. Who knows whether they will ever be able to return,” Abp. Nona said. “In 2003 there were still 35,000 faithful living in Mosul. Three thousand were still there in early 2014. Now probably not one is left here, and that is tragic,” the Archbishop declared. The city of Mosul, with a population of three million, was already mentioned in the Bible as Nineveh, and for thousands of years it has been a place of Christian civilisation. Archbishop Nona reported on the capture of Mosul: “We have never experienced anything like it before. A major city like Mosul has fallen victim to chaos.” The fighting, he said, began on Thursday, June 5; at first, however, it was limited to several districts in the western part of the city. “The army began to bombard the areas that were affected, but then the armed forces and the police suddenly left Mosul during the night between Monday and Tuesday, leaving the city at the mercy of the aggressors.” More than half of the inhabitants and the entire Christian community immediately fled to the nearby Nineveh Plain. “At around 5:00 on Tuesday morning we took in the families of refugees and tried to lodge them in schools, catechism classrooms and abandoned houses,” Nona reported.","Emil [[ie]] Nona (born November 1, 1967) is the [[diocese]] of the Chaldean Catholic Diocese of Australia and New Zealand, prior to this he has been the Chaldean Catholic [[diocese]] of Mosul in the northern part of Iraq since the consent of Pope Benedict XVI to his election on 13 November 2009.

Podcasters who create free content can not compete with the huge followings generated by commercially based content producers and therefore quickly become lost in the background noise in the podcast directories. Podcasters' Emporium was created to help solve this problem.",0
"MacHomer is a one-person [[play]] by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons. Miller first conceived of the idea in 1994, when he was performing in a production of Macbeth. The first performance of MacHomer was at the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1995. MacHomer has been re-written a number of times. The early version of the play was more of a stand-up comedy routine, but in 2000, it was expanded into a theatrical production. In 2006, for the 10th anniversary tour, Miller further revamped the play, adding new songs and characters, and incorporating videos. The script of the play \""remains 85% Shakespeare\"" and mostly follows the plot of Macbeth. Miller performs the various roles using voices from The Simpsons characters, using more than 50 voices. The set includes a video screen at the back of the stage, and sound and video effects are incorporated into the performance. Miller has performed the play in over 150 cities around the world, including performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and the Just for Laughs comedy festival. MacHomer has received largely positive reviews from critics, with praise going to Miller's impersonations. However, some critics felt that the play seems more like a group of sketches, while others felt that Miller's Homer Simpson voice was one of his weaker impersonations. According to Miller, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening is a fan of the play and gave him permission to perform it.","MacHomer is a one-person [[playwright]] by Rick Miller which blends William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth with the animated television series The Simpsons.

"Solarium Down the Causeway is the second [[EP]] by the Australian alternative rock and post-punk band Witch Hats, released on Z-Man Records in September 2009.

"Mosh n' Roll is the sixth studio [[album]] from metalcore band Bury Your Dead. Most notably, the [[album]] marks the return of the [[band's]] former vocalist, Mat Bruso. Bruso, who departed from the band after the recording of their 2006 effort, Beauty And The Breakdown, was eventually replaced by the [then] [[fill-in]] frontman Myke Terry. During his time with the band, Terry [[helped]] write and record two full-length albums: Bury Your Dead (2008) and It's Nothing Personal (2009). Terry [[left]] the band in 2010, paving the way for Bruso's return. Mosh n' Roll contains [[11]] audio tracks, although the final track, \""Mosh n' Roll\"" (identical to the album title) is not listed on the back cover or in the liner notes. The song itself was originally recorded and featured on the band's first official album, You Had Me At Hello (2002). The version that appears on Mosh n' Roll (the 2011 album) is simply a re-recorded version of the original, which has become somewhat of an anthem at Bury Your Dead shows throughout their many years of touring. Both the re-recorded track, as well as the 2011 album's title pay homage to Bury Your Dead's roots, particularly when the essential reformation of the band under which the song was originally written is taken into consideration. Of interesting note, with the exception of the above-mentioned title track, all of the songs on the album are named after Kurt Vonnegut works. This would not be the first time a Bury Your Dead album carried thematic overtones -- all of the song titles on Cover Your Tracks (2004) are named after movies featuring Tom Cruise, while Beauty and the Breakdown carried an even more holistic theme based on children's fairy-tales. The theme was not simply impressed upon track titles; it permeated the artwork, style, and was creatively incorporated into the fundamental lyrical content, itself. The album was recorded in Hyannis, MA at the The Brick HitHouse studios by Producer Shane Frisby (Frisby also produced the previous album \""it's nothing personal\""). Some 7-8 months after the announcement of Mat Bruso's return to the band, Mosh n' Roll was released on August 2nd, 2011 through Mediaskare Records. The album's record release show took place the same day at The Palladium Upstairs in Worcester, MA. The track listing, as displayed below, reflects the correct naming conventions used on the official album release (verbatim), including any punctuation (or lack thereof).","Mosh n' Roll is the sixth studio [[project]] from metalcore band Bury Your Dead.

A million-dollar yearling, big things were always expected of the son of Zabeel, and although he didn't break his maiden until his fifth start he soon started to live up to expectations. A runaway win in the Avondale Guineas at his last start before the Derby ensured that he would start favourite in the Classic, and he didn't disappoint. Given an excellent ride out in front by Greg Childs, the colt was never headed and scored a narrow but authoritative win. After the Derby his career went downhill. After disappointing performances in an autumn Sydney campaign, St Reims failed to win a single race as a four-year-old and looked to be a shadow of his former self. But at Hastings in the spring of 2004 he regained his interest in racing and put together a string of wins against horses the quality of Waitoki Dream and Zafar, culminating in a return to Group race success in the Lindauer Grandeur Stakes at Ellerslie, the scene of his Derby triumph. But he didn't stop there. He followed that win up with the Group 2 Counties Cup, a desperately close second under a demanding weight in the Group 2 Waikato Cup and a well-deserved second Group 1 victory in the Zabeel Classic at Ellerslie, just over two full years after his last Group 1 win. Following another Group 1 placing behind Xcellent in the Darley Stakes and a seventh behind the same horse in the Kelt Capital Stakes, he was retired to stand at Stoney Bridge Stud.

There are also some new manga artists as well. Perhaps the most popular manga in Cookie is Nana.

The first issue of Cookie was soon published and the second issue followed in 2000 and being published on the 26th of each month. At that time, the former Bouquet editing department was made into the Cookie editing department. The editor-in-chief had been a former editor-in-chief of Ribon. Cookie began being published monthly starting from the May 2000 issue, and switched to being published bimonthly in July 2012. Today, the manga artists featured in Cookie are a mixture of former Bouquet manga artists (some series that ran in Bouquet, such as Toriko Chiya's Clover and Yumi Ikefuji's Zoccha no Nichijou, were transferred to Cookie) and former Ribon manga artists such as Miho Obana and Ai Yazawa. There are also some new manga artists as well. Perhaps the most popular manga in Cookie is Nana. It was one of the first manga to run in Cookie and still continues today, and is also being published in many other countries around the world.",1
"The [[Basilica]] of Saint Nicholas (Dutch: Basiliek van de Heilige Nicolaas) is located in the Old Centre district of Amsterdam, Netherlands. It is the city's major Catholic [[church]]. Officially the church was called St. Nicholas inside the Walls, i.e. the oldest part of the Amsterdam defence works. The architect, Adrianus Bleijs (1842-1912) designed the [[church]] basing himself on a combination of several revival styles of which Neo-Baroque and neo-Renaissance are the most prominent models. The facade is crowned by two towers with a rose window in between. The centre of this window is formed by a bas relief depicting Christ and the four Evangelists, made in the Van den Bossche and Crevels workshop in 1886. A sculpture of the patron saint of both the church and the city of Amsterdam was placed in a niche in the upper section of the gable top. The well-known sculptor Bart van Hove (1850-1914) made the sculpture in 1886. The crossing is articulated by a large octagonal tower with a baroque dome and lantern and crowned by a cross. The basis of the groundplan is the scheme of the classic three-aisled cross-basilica, i.e. a nave, two aisles and a single transept. The choir is located as is usual, at the end of the nave. In the corners formed by the [[transept]] and the nave, two chapels are located, traditionally devoted to Mary and Joseph. The basilica has a collection of religious murals. Above the high altar is the crown of Maximilian I, which is a symbol seen throughout Amsterdam. Inside the newly renovated church, a 19th century Sauer Organ can be found, on which concerts are given and mass is accompanied.","The [[atory]] of Saint Nicholas (Dutch: Basiliek van de Heilige Nicolaas) is located in the Old Centre district of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

"Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire among ) is a white wine [[grape]] variety from the Loire valley of France.

The [[grape]] may have been one of the first to be [[grown]] in South Africa by Jan van [[Riebeeck]] in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James [[Busby's]] collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862. It provides a fairly neutral palate for the expression of terroir, vintage variation and the winemaker's treatment. In cool areas the juice is sweet but high in acid with a full-bodied fruity palate. In the unreliable summers of northern France, the acidity of under [[ripened]] grapes was often masked with chaptalization with unsatisfactory results, whereas now the less ripe grapes are made into popular sparkling wines such as Crémant de Loire. The white wines of the Anjou AOC are perhaps the best expression of [[Chenin]] as a dry wine, with flavors of quince and apples. In nearby Vouvray AOC they aim for an off-dry style, developing honey and floral characteristics with age. In the best vintages the grapes can be left on the vines to develop noble rot, producing an intense, viscous dessert wine which may improve considerably with age.","Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire among ) is a white wine [[vineyard]] variety from the Loire valley of France.

Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky.

Controllers began noticing degradation of the nickel-hydrogen battery in PAS-5 earlier 1998. The effect on operations was analyzed in June 1998. During periods of peak solar eclipse, which occur twice a year, PanAmSat will be required to shut off a portion of the satellite's payload for some time. PanAmSat reportedly received a compensation of US$185 million from its insurers after the satellite was declared a \""total loss\"" because its capacity was reduced by more than 50 percent. PAS 5 was leased in May 2002 to the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat).

"Ah [[Pook]] [[Is]] [[Here]] was a collaboration between author William S. Burroughs and artist Malcolm Mc [[Neill]]. [[It]] began in 1970, when Burroughs was living in [[London]] and Mc Neill was in his final [[year]] of art school. [[It]] first appeared under the [[title]] The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the [[English]] Cyclops. When that magazine ceased publication, Burroughs and Mc Neill [[decided]] to [[develop]] the concept as a book.

"The Vancouver Dragons were a professional basketball [[team]] in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and one of seven (7) minor league sports franchises owned by Seattle attorney and businessman Michael Tuckman, CEO of West Coast Sports, LLC. Tuckman negotiated a three-year lease with the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, British Columbia to play 24 home games each year in the 4,500-seat Agrodome in 2006. That same year, Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics and the Dragon's lease was deferred until the conclusion of the games due to the high demand for indoor sports facilities in the run-up to the Olympics. In 2001, Tuckman proposed a $150 million sports arena and performing arts center project to the city council of Bellevue, Washington, an affluent Seattle suburb, to be built on three acres of city-owned land downtown. Tuckman needed sports tenants to sign long-term leases in order to obtain financing for his project, so he paid $125,000 in cash in 2003 to purchase a CBA expansion franchise for Bellevue to become an anchor tenant. The league gave Tuckman permission to play at nearby Bellevue Community College for three years while Bellevue Civic Center Arena was being built at NE 8th and 112th NE across the street from the Meydenbauer Convention Center. When it was determined that BCC would not be a suitable venue for pro basketball, Tuckman moved the team to Vancouver and changed the name to the Dragons. In a 2006 interview with the Vancouver Sun newspaper, Tuckman cited one of the hurdles to playing in Vancouver being that most international players had single-entrance visas, which meant that if they left the United States to play a game in Canada, they could not return to the U.S. The Dragons were initially slated to play in the ABA along with Tuckman's other teams. This would be the fourth time that Vancouver had a professional basketball team; Vancouver's other professional teams were the World Basketball League's Vancouver Nighthawks, the second being the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and the International Basketball League's Vancouver Titans.

"The Fitzroy Football [[Club]], nicknamed the Lions or the Roys, is an Australian rules football [[club]] formed in 1883 to represent the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, Victoria and was a foundation member club of the Victorian Football League (now the Australian Football League) on its inception in 1897. The club experienced some early success in the league and was the first club to win a VFL Grand Final. It also achieved a total of eight VFL premierships between 1898 and 1944, and more recently two VAFA promotions in 2009 (-D Division) and 2012 (-C Division). The club ran into financial difficulties in the 1980s after decades of poor on-field performance and was forced to merge its AFL playing operations with the Brisbane Bears at the end of the 1996 season to form the Brisbane Lions. Despite this, the club survived in its own right and The Fitzroy Football Club Ltd came out of administration after the merger of its AFL playing operations in late 1998. For a brief time it experimented in partnerships with other semi professional and amateur clubs before incorporating the Fitzroy Reds (formerly University Reds) to play in the Victorian Amateur Football Association. Fitzroy largely resumed its original VFL-AFL identity through its continued use of their 1975–1996 VFL-AFL jumper, their theme song and their 1884–1966 home ground at the Brunswick Street Oval. Fitzroy began in the D1 section of the VAFA in 2009, and since then the club achieved multiple promotions to be playing in the Premier B division as of the 2016 season. It is notable for being the only club to have played in the VFA, VFL, AFL and VAFA competitions of Australian Rules football.

He was sired by Roselyon who had sired the 1930 King's Plate winner, Aymond. Roselyon was a son of the 1911 Epsom Derby winner and British Horseracing Hall of Fame inductee, Sunstar. Willie the Kid raced under the name of Willie Morrissey's girlfriend, Miss Mildred A. Kane. Trained by Gordon McCann, the oft-injured colt did not race at age two but as a three-year-old won three times in ten starts. In the May 18, 1940 King's Plate he beat a field that included Curwen, the Harry Hatch-owned colt who had been sent off as the betting favorite. The victory marked the first time a female owner won the Plate, and it was the first of six career Plate wins for trainer Gordon McCann. In the ensuing Prince of Wales Stakes, Willie the Kid again beat third-place finisher Curwen but was second to race winner, Hood. Willie the Kid came out of the race with an injury that ended his racing career.

After some consideration and a closer look at the success that they had, it occurred that they had done very well and made a good living doing it . R.B. Smith and Phil Barry returned to Oshkosh from New York and Chicago, respectively, and reformed the band in the spring of 1974. Cimmeron was a well rehearsed band with multiple costume changes and a well choreographed stage show. Perhaps they were best known for their strong vocals and their ability to do the complex harmonies. The fact that they were all good singers, they could recreate the vocals of Beach Boys and the Four Seasons. They used this formula to get the band started, and for many years to follow.

Currently, all [[servicing]] is [[issued]] under a five-year total routine maintenance (TRM) contract with Roy [[ey]] Associates, Inc.

The [[railroad]] passes through three Texas counties (Dallas, Collin and [[beaumont]]) and nine Dallas [[stations]] (Rowlett, Sachse, Garland, Richardson, Plano, Carrollton, Farmers Branch, Irving and Grand Prairie). [[prior]] the PGBT was equipped with traditional toll plazas for cash payment as well as RFID-based TollTag express lanes.

This [[had]] the turnpike the first in the United States to transition to all-electronic toll collection. The ZipCash rates, however, come at a premium being significantly higher than both the TollTag rate and the earlier cash prices.",2

"Bonnie-Briar County Club is an [[18-hole]] golf [[course]] and country club located in the Town of Mamaroneck in Westchester County, New York. The course architect was A. W. Tillinghast, one of the most prolific architects in the history of golf, and designer of nearby Southern Westchester courses including Quaker Ridge Golf Club, Wykagyl Country Club and Winged Foot Golf Club. The course design made excellent use of Bonnie Briar's hilly and low wetland areas, surrounding a wooded interior. A.H. Tull, Geoffrey Cornish and Robert Trent also contributed to various aspects of the course layout, drainage, tees, greens and bunkers. After World War I, real estate activity in the Town of Mamaroneck surged and the number of families moving into the area brought about a need for country and beach clubs which were then few in number. The land had belonged to the Lyman Bill estate. Colonel E. Lyman Bill, a successful publisher and one of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, had owned a large piece of property along the Mamaroneck and New Rochelle border, on which he had a private club with tennis courts and a rudimentary golf course. The first and ninth fairways became the site of the first golf layout in the United States. The Colonel wanted to build a palatial residence on his estate, yet died before its completion.

For decades it was a major milestone on the clipper route, by which sailing [[ships]] carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and Icebergs; these dangers have made it notorious as a sailors' graveyard. The need for ships to [[round]] Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. [[Sailing]] around the Horn is widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus, a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe, and almost all of these choosing routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point). Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the VELUX 5 Oceans, and the Vendée Globe, [[sail]] around the world via the [[Horn]]. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route. There have been a number of small boat roundings of the Horn but one in particular stands out: Howard Rice sailed and paddled a 15-foot (4.6 m) wood canvas folding canoe doubling the Horn.
