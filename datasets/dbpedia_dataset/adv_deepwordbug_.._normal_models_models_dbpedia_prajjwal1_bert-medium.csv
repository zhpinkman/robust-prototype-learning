"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club [[faced]] Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage [[band]], they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter.

"(148209) [[2000]] [[CR105]], [[also]] written as (148209) 2000 [[CR105]], is the [[tenth-most-distant]] known [[object]] in the Solar System as of 2015. [[Considered]] a detached [[object]], it orbits the Sun in a highly eccentric [[orbit]] every 3305 years at an average distance of 222 astronomical units (AU). Mike Brown's website lists it as a possible dwarf [[planet]] with a diameter of 328 kilometres (204 mi) based on an assumed [[albedo]] of 0.04. The [[albedo]] is expected to be low because the object has a blue (neutral) color. However, if the albedo is higher, the object could easily be half that size. (148209) 2000 [[CR105]] and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational influence of the planet Neptune even at their perihelion distances (closest approaches to the Sun). It is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been put forward: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered (albeit unlikely), giant planet. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an [[undiscovered]] companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a star like the Sun had an early close encounter and a 1% probability that outer planetary exchanges would have happened. (148209) 2000 [[CR105]] is estimated to be 2–3 times more likely to be a captured planetary object than Sedna. (148209) 2000 [[CR105]] is the first [[object]] [[discovered]] in the Solar System to have a semi-major axis exceeding 150 AU, a perihelion beyond Neptune, and an argument of perihelion of 340 ± 55°.

[[Considred]] a detached [[bject]], it orbits the Sun in a highly eccentric [[orbio]] every 3305 years at an average distance of 222 astronomical units (AU). Mike Brown's website lists it as a possible dwarf [[palnet]] with a diameter of 328 kilometres (204 mi) based on an assumed [[abedo]] of 0.04. The [[abedo]] is expected to be low because the object has a blue (neutral) color. However, if the albedo is higher, the object could easily be half that size. (148209) 2000 [[C105]] and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational influence of the planet Neptune even at their perihelion distances (closest approaches to the Sun). It is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been put forward: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered (albeit unlikely), giant planet. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an [[undiscovehed]] companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a star like the Sun had an early close encounter and a 1% probability that outer planetary exchanges would have happened. (148209) 2000 [[R105]] is estimated to be 2–3 times more likely to be a captured planetary object than Sedna. (148209) 2000 [[C105]] is the first [[oject]] [[discoevered]] in the Solar System to have a semi-major axis exceeding 150 AU, a perihelion beyond Neptune, and an argument of perihelion of 340 ± 55°.

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of population served. The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger [[route]] in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.","The West Coast Main [[Linb]] (WCML) is a major inter-city railway [[orute]] in the United Kingdom.

In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h). The WCML has a significantly higher number of curves than most other main lines in Britain, hence the requirement for tilting operation for higher speeds.",2

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared. The former idea that Niḫriya was to be equated with Na’iri, along the Upper Tigris, has been shown to be wrong. As per the Mari and Dur-Katlimmu letters, Niḫriya was located in the Upper Balih region.","[[he]] [[Battl]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hosilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[line]] that was [[built]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil [[War]], Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations.

"[[The]] 1904–05 Football League [[season]] was Small Heath Football Club's 13th in the Football League and their 5th in the First Division. In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh.

"[[Col]] de Pierre Pertuis ([[el]]. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] [[pass]] in the Jura [[Mountains]] in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. [[It]] connects [[Sonceboz]] and [[Tavannes]].

A 159 by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the road lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony Aventicum, as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. It probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky gate leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern Avenches)-[[Salodurum]] (modern Solothurn)-Augusta Raurica road with the Vesontio (modern Besançon)-Epomanduodurum (modern Mandeure)-Kembs road. [[The]] [[pass]] was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel.

Notable examples are the emergence of jazz through the interaction between New Orleans and Cuba, the Afro-Cuban jazz in the 1940s and 1950s, Arab influence in Jazz in the 1950s and 1960s and Indian influence through The Beatles and Rock Jazz of the 1960s and 1970s.

They played their home games at Huskie Stadium. They [[finished]] the [[season]] 12–2, 8–0 in MAC play to win MAC West Division Title. With their win over Kent State in the MAC Championship Game on November 30, NIU moved to 12–1, the most regular season wins in the program's 113-year history. Since the MAC was a non-automatic qualifying (non-AQ) conference, its conference champion had to finish 16th or higher in the BCS ranking and be ranked ahead of at least one AQ conference champion to qualify for a BCS game. With their MAC Championship, the Huskies moved to No. 15 in the final Bowl Championship Series rankings, while Big East champion Louisville was ranked No. 21. As a result, Northern Illinois received a BCS bid to the Orange Bowl against Florida State. It was the first major-bowl appearance in school history, as well as the first-ever major-bowl appearance for a MAC team. Head coach Doeren did not coach the Huskies in the Orange Bowl after accepting the head coaching job at North Carolina State. Co-offensive coordinator Rod Carey was named his successor, and coached the bowl game. The Huskies lost to Florida State 10–31. The [[season]] marked the Huskies' [[fifth]] consecutive trip to a bowl game.","[[he]] [[2V012]] Northern Illinois Huskies football team represented Northern Illinois University in the [[2B12]] [[NACA]] Division I [[BFS]] [[fooball]] [[seasoqn]].

"KLG (Chinese: 快樂雞; pinyin: Kuàilèjī in Taiwan; referred to as Kuai Le Gee in Malaysia, meaning \""Happy Chicken\"") is a fast food chain in Taiwan, headquartered in Fengyuan District, Taichung. It was a fast food [[restaurant]] chain in Malaysia, Taiwan, and mainland China, which had several similarities with KFC. The lettering of KLG adopted the same font and colour as KFC. KLG's logo depicted a plump chicken wearing a bow tie. In Malaysia, there were several outlets in Ipoh, Penang (near Farlim) and Langkawi Island. KLG's menu was relatively similar to that of KFC's in that fried chicken, french fries, chicken burgers and soft drinks were available in both restaurant chains. All KLG locations are now closed.","KLG (Chinese: 快樂雞; pinyin: Kuàilèjī in Taiwan; referred to as Kuai Le Gee in Malaysia, meaning \""Happy Chicken\"") is a fast food chain in Taiwan, headquartered in Fengyuan District, Taichung.
