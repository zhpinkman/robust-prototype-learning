"One of the greatest [[lessons]] I ever had in how to watch a movie happened this way: <br /><br />I was working in Roger Corman's offices, like so many other wanabees before and since, I was interning and trying to figure out how it all worked and how to make myself indispensable (hah!). One afternoon Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in her own right, asked me to load up a tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I got the impression it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, some sort of calling card. Whatever the reasons she had to see it, the only free video machine in the offices at the time happened to be in the room I was working in, and I was the nearest person to the machine. I started the [[tape]].<br /><br />Fade in: On screen a figure sat at a desk facing the camera. Behind him, screen left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the far wall was a coat rack. A second character entered through the door and started talking. The first character, the guy at the desk, turned round to reply, (this is all one take, static camera, there are no cuts [[pans]] or dolly shots. Just one locked off camera). The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and [[delivered]] his next line. Julie [[Corman]] said ""[[I've]] seen [[enough]]."" and left the room.<br /><br />What she had seen in the ten seconds of footage she had watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera delivering lines? [[Nope]], sorry. Next! That's how long you've got. Ten seconds. Cock it up in the opening shot and you are dead.<br /><br />I was reminded of that moment while I watched the opening of this piece of [[crap]]. After an interminably long travelogue of jungle we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into cages. A man carrying a gun laughs. A jet liner lands and we see it taxi the whole way to the terminal. God this is [[boring]]! Cut to the interior of the Airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle of the two men -<br /><br />- and the director crosses the line.<br /><br />The first two shots of the movie that have any kind of spatial relationship with each other and the guy has cocked up. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those basic rules of movie grammar that keeps the characters from jumping about from side to side on the screen and confusing the audience. Audiences don't like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. Audiences love all of those. Confused? No. You loose them. They walk out. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those things they pound into you at film school, or should. It's basic stuff. It's not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors break it all the time - but not on the first real cut of the movie.<br /><br />I thought, ""I've seen enough"". And switched off.",0
"[[The]] [[Comebacks]] is a spoof on [[inspirational]] sports [[movies]], and [[let]] me just [[tell]] you-it is not a [[good]] [[one]]. Tom Brady (the director) [[probably]] found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from [[Gridiron]] [[Gang]], Invincible and [[even]] Miracle! to [[The]] [[Longest]] Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex [[jokes]], would be the funniest [[thing]] since [[Airplane]]! Well, he was [[wrong]]. They did such a [[slipshod]] job, you'd thought it was written in a [[week]]. I have found it that if a [[director]] loves the [[genre]], the movie will be good. [[Obviously]], Brady does not [[love]] the genre he is [[spoofing]]. This movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing, so don't see it!",0
"I have a strong feeling that what you think of this film will strongly depend on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a Miyazaki film before, then it will probably confuse the heck out of you. If you have seen a [[Miyazaki]] film before, then it will still probably confuse the heck out of you....but you won't really care! [[That's]] because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated [[films]], I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and [[why--and]] it impacted my [[enjoyment]] of the film. Now that I have seen just about every [[Miyazaki]] film, [[I]] [[see]] the bizarreness and just take it all [[in--enjoying]] the beauty of it all. In many [[ways]], these films (at least to [[Western]] audiences) is [[like]] [[drugs--lots]] of strange and [[beautiful]] [[images]] that don't [[always]] [[initially]] [[make]] sense but sure [[feel]] [[great]] to [[see]]!! [[Of]] all the [[Miyazaki]] [[films]], this might have the most unusual and [[incomprehensible]] story [[line--even]] more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS [[MONONOKE]] or [[MY]] NEIGHBOR [[TOTORO]]. [[But]], like these and many other Studio [[Gibli]] films, if you just sit back and watch you are rewarded with a [[fabulous]] [[tale]]. But, because it is so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won't even go there.<br /><[[br]] />As for the artwork, it's very typical of one of these Japanese [[films]], though there was one noticeable [[change]]. There was a very extensive use of what looked like colored pencils for the [[backgrounds]]. This was [[NOT]] a [[bad]] thing at all--the [[lovely]] pastel-like look was very pleasing and unique. In some ways it looked like a tiny bit of [[Bill]] Plympton's art style was infused into a typical Miyazaki film. With a [[high]] [[frame-rate]], [[exceptional]] [[character]] animation (which imbued them with tons of personality) and a great ""wow-factor"", this is an [[exceptional]] film for all [[ages]]. Though clearly designed more for younger audiences (the TOTORO fans especially), it is a bit scary here and there (during the storm segments) but there is plenty of great stuff for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically so), I loved the cute stuff and applaud the other-worldliness of the film.<br /><br />A great film--among Miyazaki's best. I don't give it a 10 because I am hesitant to ever do that--plus I did like a few of the studio's other films a bit more (particularly TOTORO). But that DOESN'T mean you shouldn't rush out now and see it--do it and do yourself a favor.",1
"Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. [[Credible]] performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are [[artificially]] propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you will learn something about the script meetings. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn, you'll be able to pick them out. [[Despite]] the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this one should have [[washed]] out the very first day.",0
"In this [[era]] when almost everything makes it on to DVD (I'm expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now) this film has been unfairly [[neglected]]. There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60's as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment. This one wasn't even released on VHS to my knowledge, despite the talents involved in the making (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Anne Jackson, Murray Shisgal (notable later for co-writing Tootsie), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). It's obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era. All films reflect the tastes and customs of the times in which they are made. This was released the same year as The President's Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. That film was finally released on DVD and has developed a cult following. This film has many memorable bizarre, goofy, wacky moments. Sure, it's painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music throughout but that's part of its charm. It creates its own absurd universe. If whoever is in charge of DVD production for Columbia Pictures releases (I believe Columbia released it) takes polls for new releases this gets my vote.",1
"[[Not]] since ""8 Heads in a Duffel [[Bag]]"" and the ""How High"" previews<br /><br />have I laughed so little at something that the film makers thought<br /><br />[[would]] be hysterical.<br /><br />Jerry Lewis is the [[richest]] [[man]] in the [[world]]. [[He]] is [[rejected]] as 4-F<br /><br />by the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army-<br /><br />of about half a [[dozen]]. He then impersonates a [[Nazi]] commander in<br /><[[br]] />Italy, and eventually tries to kill [[Hitler]]. [[That]] is the description of the<br /><br />[[flimsy]] plot.<br /><br />This film is as funny as a heart [[attack]]. [[This]] film [[makes]] ""Hogan's<br /><br />[[Heroes]]"" look like [[Shakespeare]]. If the [[money]] men of ""The<[[br]] /><br />Producers"" had really wanted to lose their cash, they should have<br /><br />[[shown]] this film. [[I]] cannot stress how [[bad]] this thing is.<br /><br />Lewis' [[direction]] consists of two different cameras shooting the<br /><br />action from two different angles, then being edited together. This<br /><br />sitcom type of direction works on television, but here it is an<br /><br />obvious attempt to cheat the audience. He ends most of his<br /><br />scenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to double<br /><br />over in stitches before going to the next [[tired]] set up. I spent most of<br /><br />the movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied with<br /><br />severe flatulence, over this thing.<br /><br />Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes<br /><br />no attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone wears the<br /><br />latest style and has the latest interior design...for 1970. The<br /><br />supporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on his patented tangents,<br /><br />which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to<br /><br />watch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the<br /><br />last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a<br /><br />performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring<br /><br />in at the beginning.<br /><br />The final embarassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to<br /><br />put one over on the Japanese. They wear buck teeth, squint their<br /><br />eyes, and talk in a ""funny"" accent. It may be one of the most<br /><br />blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. I was<br /><br />slack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing, but that put<br /><br />me over the edge. Watch for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene<br /><br />where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.<br /><br />""Star Trek""'s George Takei has two small scenes, then wisely<br /><br />drops out of the picture. This has less laughs than Mel Brooks' last<br /><br />three films combined. There is nothing sadder than watching a<br /><br />formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, you<br /><br />actually feel ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned that with ""The<br /><br />Majestic,"" but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a<br /><br />while pulling the same unfunny schtick. I feel sorry for him.<br /><br />""Which Way to the Front?"" is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid.<br /><br />I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this.<br /><br />I do not recommend it.<br /><br />Though rated (G), this contains some physical violence, some gun<br /><br />violence, and some adult situations. If your child shows interest in<br /><br />seeing this, please consult professional help.<br /><br />",0
"I've seen a few of Mr. Boorman's movies and didn't like much of them. Not that they are bad movies, quite the contrary are good movies, but not content I personally found entertaining. However I think Where the Heart Is, although made to cater to the less than art savvy American audience, is [[masterful]] as satire, and as social commentary of the times it was made in. I've had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times, since every time I loan it out to someone I know could appreciate it's artistry on all its levels, my copy fails to come back home to me, lol. The last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales, has never been made as a DVD that I know of, and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before I could tape it again.<br /><br />My favorite aspect after the nail-on-the-head social commentary is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I've searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale. Or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in, and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of her work. If anyone does know of where I can acquire any sort of copy of Timna's work or where her studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me via email.",1

"The 2002 version of ""The Time Machine"" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. <br /><br />What a [[lousy]], [[uninspired]] bland [[story]], with no [[imagination]]. [[Why]] so totally [[rewrite]] such a wonderful sci-fi [[classic]]? Are today's movie audiences too hip for the H.G. Wells writing largely as is? [[The]] [[1960]] George Pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky [[low-budget]] effects, beach-party looking Eloi, and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />The 2002 [[version]] must have H.G Wells [[turning]] in his grave:<br /><br />1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. This sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy Einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma  not have it dawn on him 800,000 yrs in the future  from a Morlock no less, Doh!! What's wrong with time-traveling just for fun & adventure & curiosity -- as embodied in the 1960 version?<br /><br />2. Only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it. [[The]] George Pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of 'travel' though a 4th dimension.<br /><br />3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look geeky, a worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little nerdy too (at least around Weena) but managed to be swashbuckling, playful and charming.<br /><br />4. Among the key themes of the 60's version -- abandoned in the remake -- is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing up the Moon to destroy humanity is pointless -- and doesn't do much for science literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but this is just plain dumb and meaningless.<br /><br />5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blowing up the machine to kill Morlocks is sort of a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointingly, Pearce never comes back to the 1800s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back.<br /><br />6. Having Morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night. A true cinematic opportunity lost. Also, Wells depicted the Eloi as frail and childlike. These guys in the movie looked like they could take on Morlocks, if they weren't such big baby wusses.<br /><br />7. The one smart Morlock  kind of a bleached-out Star Wars Evil Emperor -- had potential, but is so lame and aloof he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic high point! In the book the Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it, and fight to keep it.<br /><br />8. The goof ball hologram at the N.Y. Public Library is too much. It makes light of the idea of human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the ""talking rings"" that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind. Derailed evolution is serious stuff.<br /><br />Its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.",0
"[[Margaret]] [[Mitchell]] [[spins]] in her [[grave]] [[every]] time somebody [[watches]] this [[mess]]!

[[Even]] [[worse]] than the [[acting--and]] perhaps partially [[explaining]] [[it--is]] the script, which is astoundingly cliched and [[predictable]]. [[Add]] to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster I wouldn't wish on any viewer.

"J.S. Cardone directed a little known 'Video Nasty' in 1982 called ""The Slayer"" and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films; including the rubbish 2001 [[vampire]] movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, [[boasts]] a plot that [[sounds]] decent as well as a creepy looking poster that I seem to [[remember]] [[surfacing]] a couple of years ago in relation to a film that Tobe Hooper was meant to direct. Well I guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie [[fungus]] movie 'Mortuary' and so turned this [[one]] down. [[I]] don't blame him for it either. The [[plot]] [[focuses]] on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. However, what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier; a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a [[mineshaft]]. [[Naturally]], that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge <br /><br />The film is [[essentially]] a collection of [[clichés]]; from the youngest kid with an ""imaginary friend"", the mother who dismisses it and all the usual [[zombie]] rubbish. J.S. Cardone [[attempts]] to get the [[horror]] fans back on side with shocks and [[gory]] scenes (mostly involving kids) but its not [[enough]]. The story doesn't [[play]] out very [[well]] at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier Mortuary, and that's not a [[good]] thing (although Mortuary is actually a better film than this one). The acting is [[nothing]] to write home about either; Lori Heuring is decent [[looking]], as is eldest daughter Scout [[Taylor-Compton]]; but [[neither]] manages to provide an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor. The plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can't [[even]] be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals. It all boils down to a typical and rather [[dull]] ending and overall I have to say that if you know your horror [[movies]], then you can feel free to [[skip]] this one!",0
"I have to say this is [[better]] than most SyFy outings, but that isn't saying much.<br /><br />The [[plot]] is that someone [[buys]] a [[game]] that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and nobody ever expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway through when the friend who went on the beer run is killed in a way that the game predicted.<br /><br />What then follows are a series of kills that are typical for a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. It has the puzzle at the end and the [[interesting]] subplot with the cop who wants the game to [[bring]] back his family... but otherwise, it's just a [[mess]].",0
"Wow! It's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure. It's my [[favorite]] of the [[season]]. [[Six]] people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure [[isolated]] in the [[middle]] of the arctic with an [[unknown]] organism that [[causes]] murderous aggression, the drama can't get any [[better]] than that. Paranoia reigns supreme as even Mulder and Scully have doubts about each [[other's]] sanity. I've heard people complain about this episode's similarities to the movie 'The Thing'. I haven't seen it, so I wouldn't know. Ice is more than worth watching just to see Mulder and [[Scully]] truly testing their still developing trust of one another. This episode is intense and suspenseful to the end. You won't be [[disappointed]]!",1
"Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish ""epic"" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the Earth. Potentially exciting story [[fails]] to take off, [[despite]] an eclectic cast. Varied players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this [[soggy]] sci-fi is pretty cheesy. Good for a few stray laughs, but Allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. Later a popular TV series. ** from ****",0
"Meh, Sums it all up for me really. Boring story, bland dialogue, dull action scenes (HOW do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring? Do you actually have to TRY to do that?), no real characters etc. [[Just]] [[dull]]. [[Snipes]] is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work, when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. [[Imagine]] a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action, fights, shootouts, etc. How can it be that hard to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man etc? Awesome, intense [[performances]] [[complemented]] by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supporting casts and [[wicked]] [[action]].<br /><br />None of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous [[shame]]. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover, knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.<br /><br />I'd love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. Together they [[would]] all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.<br /><br />Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, which chews, but it still really [[sucks]].",0
"This movie is one of the only historical documents displaying the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses, and dancers. Many who are no longer with us. Those which we are blessed to be able to enjoy today in 1999, through this film lets [[us]] recognize the talents that existed then. This is why those individuals still living today as well those who are deceased are super star icons. Due to the educational history in music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this movie alone belongs to the people of this country.<br /><br />I viewed this movie recently. The sound was [[excellent]]! The movie appeared to be complete, color and clarity was fare, but good [[considering]] how old this [[movie]] is without any repairs on frames. I agree with all prior positive reviews. I do not have any negative views.<br /><br />I only would like to make one request.

"Spoilers!!<br /><br />I hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting [[worse]]. I hope Gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one. A lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc. How much farther can we watch their relationship evolve. Drugs, bad guys why South Africa! I found that unbelievable, maybe South American, some country in the Golden Triangle would have made the [[script]] better. It seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie Die Hard, the mighty Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself over. This one with a similar story has to go over the top. The attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top Gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. Like many part 2's, they get [[worse]], and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10",0
"I am not a fan of musicals, but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly [[surprised]] even expecting greatness from the [[classic]] director.

I cannot [[express]] how [[much]] this movie [[transcends]] itself... it's not [[really]] a [[musical]], it just has a couple of [[well-placed]] musical [[numbers]] and a grand dancing finale. But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel [[absolute]] JOY when watching it.<br /><br />I am a fan of [[foreign]] art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like [[Die]] Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in ""la la land,"" but this movie has an [[overwhelming]] positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.",1
"This is one odd film. It [[seems]] to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual [[innuendos]]. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some [[shrunken]] heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little [[far-fetched]], but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a [[lack]] of authority figures to keep the kids in line.<br /><br />The cast are good [[though]], Meg Foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome A.J. Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well cast as the young lovers, though for a comic actress of her talent, Leigh [[Allyn]] Baker is notoriously wasted in this film.<br /><br />Overall, the film is unusual, but I don't think that is enough to make up for the [[poor]] quality and bumbling [[execution]]. The scenery is all rather [[dull]] and the ""special effects"" quite dismal. Sit this one out, [[unless]] your in the [[mood]].",0
"I saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because I felt it was a waste of time.

"Never mind if 'National Velvet (1944)' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing, Clarence Brown's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral. After achieving modest success through her appearance in 'Lassie Come Home (1943),' young Elizabeth Taylor, age 12, landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown, a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses. Though filmed in California, the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township on the English countryside, and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs. Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor, a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions, whose relationship with young Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new, optimistic chapter in his life. Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence, when he must confess the traumatic experience that [[led]] to his fear of horses, Rooney is [[enjoyable]] as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth.<br /><br />It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those entrancing violet eyes, because her acting abilities, at this young age, were rather limited. Her more emotional sequences, in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity, strike one as being [[rather]] hollow, and the touchingly-naive notion that simply ""believing"" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made. Nevertheless, Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic, and she works well with Mickey Rooney, who was no stranger to being a child-star. Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvet's mother, once a famous athlete, who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than Mi Taylor's own father. I liked that Mi was not told about this until the film's final seconds, with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency, rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain, as he would undoubtedly have done at the film's beginning.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes, where Velvet has, at the last moment, decided to ride her own horse, the Pi, in the world-famous competition. Under the guise of a Latvian male, she goes on, as expected, to win the race, but is later disqualified - either because she's a girl, or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount (what a stupid rule!). This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done, effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds, and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney's character, stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update. It doesn't really matter that we know it's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes, we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same. I'll wager that 'National Velvet' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years, and it's power to inspire has decreased little with time.",1

"Where the heck is Andreas(Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the bothersome man steps off the subway platform and meets an onrushing train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; riding solo, the newest arrival, in a dead netherworld where all the suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the corporeal biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the bothersome man from the barren flatlands to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ringer for the sort of urban landscapes that he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleepwalker in a trance, a man estranged from people and objects, struggling to find his bearings; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the bothersome man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard(Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him, ""You'll get used to it,"" which covers more than just crunching numbers, we suspect, in this world, same as the old world.<br /><br />If life is meaningless, like French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same can be said for death, as well. The subculture of office life might be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context that ""Den Brysomme Mannen"" operates on. To work in the afterlife, in essence, is to work for the rest of your life. The social intercourse among Andreas' office mates may pass as normal in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he/she now [[recognizes]] the [[drudgery]] of white-collar labor performed by white-collar laborers, who kill the hours with their inconsequential small-talk and designated jobs they perform during the course of a day like automotons, each and every day, seem irrational in its self-evident absurdity. To see daily life replicated in a speculative light, ""Den Brysomme mannen"" makes normal human interaction look like deadpan comedy, as quotidian life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word ""alienation"", because here, the men and women in the office, ""do"" identify with their labor, like actors in a play who conspire to make their fictionalized selves appear real. But the bothersome man never fully participates in the facade. He's always aware of the cracks.<br /><br />From a wooden bench, Andreas witnesses the aftermath of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while people on their lunch breaks walk on by, indifferent to his escaping intestines that create red splatters on the clean sidewalk. Andreas faces the same impassivity from his own co-workers after he purposely cuts off his own finger, with the hope that he'll feel the pain, on a paper slicer. He doesn't. It's just another sensation, in addition to being able to taste and smell that's lost to the bothersome man. This inability of being able to take solace in the simple pleasures, amplifies the bothersome man's need for love,where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt(Petonella Barker). They hit it off. He walks her home. She invites him in. They become a couple. He moves in. When they have sex, however, it's good for neither Andreas, nor Anne, who seems to get more pleasure out of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that's unattainable in this world, but love matters to the bothersome man, so he tries again with Ingeborg(Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. ""Den Brysomme mannen"" deconstructs love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances from both the man and woman. When Ingeborg doesn't elicit the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but odd city, with an open-endedness that's solvable, and offer up multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his avowal of love for her, the bothersome man wanders into the same subway station, stands at the same platform, leers at the same couple aggressively making out, and jumps. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after train, Andreas' face turns into ground beef; his body contorts in angles previously seen only seen in art. When the bothersome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks out the man from the club, who was willing to say what goes unsaid in this city of the walking dead. Which is: death, not life, has no meaning.<br /><br />Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind Andreas' whereabouts drives the narrative, and to the filmmaker's credit, this enigma is satisfactorily addressed, in a scene that recalls Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"", when Andreas crawls through a tunnel in order to cross over into another world, like a newborn baby, which resembles the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz charges people to crawl through. Andreas' attempt to traverse the great divide presents a beguiling paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable boundary acts as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that ""heaven is a place on Earth"". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of a hell; the place that Andreas is sent to after being banished from the city of his destination.",1

It brought him food and before long the soldier became almost totally wild so acute was his bonding with the animal.

"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was [[awful]]. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it [[fleetingly]].",0
"At 20 years old, Francis Ouimet (Shia [[Lebouf]]) as his whole life ahead of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant family living in the [[late-19th]] to [[early-20th]] Century-era United States, class was a very limiting fact of life. If one is born poor, one stays poor; if one is born into the bourgeoisie, one has a tiny bit of opportunity; if one is born into the wealthy class, they essentially have it made in the shade. British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis' golf idol (played by the criminally underrated Stephen Dillane) is the exception that proves the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his accomplished skill at golf allowed him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorest slums to the lush greens of the English country clubs. He has not [[forgotten]] this life lesson. Francis wishes to follow in [[Vardon's]] footsteps and similarly uses his great skill at golf to get into the 1913 US Open at age 20. But a tough course and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis must deal with as a [[less-than-understanding]] father and cruel societal framework stand in his way of living his own dream.<br /><br />I know what you are thinking - I thought it too - a Walt Disney produced film about the 1913 US Open [[starring]] the [[irritable]] Shia [[LaBeouf]] holds the possibility of being entertaining but it cannot possibly be a great film. Well, I am here to encourage you to think again. Despite what it may look to some on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sport films in creation.<br /><br />As with every great sport film, The Greatest Game Ever Played includes many exciting sport scenes but it is not a film *about* golf - it is a character centered film about using [[one's]] talents, following [[one's]] dreams, and breaking out of class barriers. Where The Greatest Game [[Ever]] Played [[works]] [[excellently]] as a themed sport film it also works just as well as a period film - the film's featured costumes and sets being the next best thing to actual time travel. The film also simply *looks* great and virtually unknown music composer Brian Tyler set the film to a wonderful piece of music. The cast is great as well with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as British golfing champion Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as man's man golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh Flitter as Francis' pre-teenaged caddy Eddie, and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the lead role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) turns director here for the second time (directing a full-length feature) in The Greatest Game Ever Played. He produces a fine product - incorporating plenty of heart, ingenuity, and an attention to detail in the making of the film.",1

"It just so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II both had entries in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty [[poor]] films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and ""googly eyed looks"" than I have ever seen before!! Director Eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film ""artsy and profound""--and since I am legally sane, I must say that I hated this first film!! The second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! While part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to Ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that Ivan's life story is left very incomplete. Even without all the truly awful behaviors of Ivan, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a HUGE waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as a crazy guy just like Ivan! <br /><br />By the way, there was one segment of this [[tedious]] film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. And, the scene was done in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by Technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. So, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very odd indeed for the 1940s.",0

"Venice, in 1596.Jews are separated from the good Christians.[[Bassanio]], a young but poor Venetian loves the fair [[Portia]], who is a wealthy heiress.So he approaches his friend, a merchant called Antonio for three thousand ducats to travel to Belmont and propose [[Portia]].All of [[Antonio's]] ships and merchandise are busy at sea, so he turns to the [[moneylender]] [[Shylock]], the one of Jewish faith.[[Shylock]] does not like Antonio, for he spat on his face.He offers Antonio a [[three-month]] loan at no interest, but if he will not pay the money in that time, he will own a pound of his flesh.Also, [[Shylock's]] [[daughter]] [[Jessica]] elopes with the Christian [[Lorenzo]].The Merchant of Venice is based on [[William]] Shakespeare's [[play]] that's believed to have written between 1596 and 1598.[[I]] read the play last summer and now [[I've]] seen the movie, made in 2004 by Michael [[Radford]].I liked the play, and I don't quite agree with the accusations of it being [[anti-Semitic]].[[The]] [[Jewish]] character does not appear as an inhuman monster, [[even]] [[though]] he's ready to cut a piece of [[Antonio's]] [[flesh]].There's a lot of depth in his character, which all comes out in his speech where he [[asks]] ""If you [[prick]] us, do we not bleed?"" and so [[forth]].There is much more human in [[Shylock's]] character than in one of Antonio's, who spits on the [[good]] [[Jew]].Al Pacino is unbeatable as [[Shylock]].[[He]] gives such a [[strong]] [[performance]].[[Jeremy]] Irons is [[also]] terrific as [[Antonio]].[[Lynn]] Collins is most beautiful and brilliant in the role of [[Portia]].Zuleikha Robinson does [[great]] job as Jessica, and Charlie Cox as Lorenzo is also very good.Kris Marshall plays Gratiano, and he does a good job.In the role of Nerissa we see [[Heather]] Goldenhersh.Mackenzie Crook [[plays]] Launcelot [[Gobbo]].As in [[Shakespeare]] plays [[usually]], also this one contains most [[brilliant]] [[dialogue]].[[The]] [[movie]] paints a [[fantastic]] portray of the [[era]].It deals with some great issues, in a [[Shakespearian]] way.",1
"Last week on Friday, I went to see ""Snakes on a Plane"" with my friends. It was [[amazing]] compared to this [[horrible]] [[film]] (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically, some [[woman]] has a [[Mayan]] curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside of they're [[victims]]. [[The]] [[girl]] with the bag of coke is pretty hot. On the title screen it says ""100 Passengers... 3,[[000]] Venemous Vipers!"" Scary, [[I]] know. There weren't even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. It's [[worth]] the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and [[devour]] the whole train then get sucked into a [[huge]] vortex though. It's just sad that someone would go to such [[lengths]] to [[make]] a crap film, only to make a few bucks because of the ""Snakes on a Plane"" craze.",0
I really loved this movie and have [[spent]] [[several]] [[years]] [[trying]] to [[get]] it. It is just not [[available]] and it has not been on [[TV]] for many [[many]] years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something [[different]] to say and made you think how every person looks at something from [[different]] prespectives. Also we [[often]] don't appreciate something we have till it is no [[longer]] there.<br /><br />[[My]] [[12]] year old daughter just discoverd the music and is entranced with some of the songs. Someday I hope to get a copy of the film so she can have an opportunity to view it. ([[Oh]] would I [[love]] to see it again too!)<br /><br />,1
"I'm rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent, if provocative, idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship, but one (if I can judge by the real-life examples I've known) is extremely deep and loving.<br /><br />However, the film is cheaply scripted--poorly scripted--and although it has a number of very pretty-looking shots, I didn't find it to be anything special.<br /><br />Probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly-composed to give its audience time enough to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don't really care about any of them, and so their stresses and obstacles don't really touch us.<br /><br />I think a REMAKE--from the screenplay up--with some character development by some really good writers--could improve it greatly. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the screen-writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay--screen-writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy, and carried out their task with care, planning, and superb craftsmanship! However, people only seem to remake those films that don't need it! You're not really missing anything if you skip this one: I found it very [[disappointing]] indeed, and it is only saved from getting a 1-star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject.",0
"What happened to Ava Gardner in the 1940s and Marilyn [[Monroe]] in the '50s also seemed to take place for modern-day actress [[Michelle]] Pfeiffer in the '[[80s]]: Her remarkable good [[looks]] got in the way of her being taken seriously as an accomplished, superbly talented actress. [[Anyone]] looking for validation of Pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's ""Frankie and Johnny"" or '92's ""Love Field"" (a personal favorite of mine); those looking to see what a splendid [[comedic]] [[actress]] she can be, when given the right part, should [[check]] out 1988's ""[[Married]] to the Mob."" [[In]] this one, she [[plays]] Angela Demarco, the widow of a recently ""[[iced]]"" Mob hit-man, who moves from her garishly tacky [[Long]] [[Island]] home to start a [[new]] life for herself and her son, while being pursued by [[Mob]] [[boss]] Dean Stockwell and FBI man Matthew Modine. While this movie has lots going for it (a very [[amusing]] [[script]]; [[offbeat]] characters; sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence, as in director Jonathan [[Demme's]] previous effort ""Something Wild""; and hilarious [[yet]] menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl, as his jealous wife from hell), Michelle steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails Angela's undereducated, Long Island Italian accent, and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character. Once upon a time, long ago, Oscars were handed out to actresses for comedic roles such as this one. Had this film been made 60 years ago, Michelle mighta been a contenduh...",1
"I can't [[imagine]] why it hasn't been [[theatrically]] [[released]] [[yet]]. [[It's]] got a [[great]] ensemble cast, with Sutherland, Lane, and [[especially]] Chris [[Evans]] doing [[spectacular]] [[work]].

[[He]] [[said]] they aren't stupid, they're very smart (as opposed to how they may portray themselves), they've got plans, and they are a threat!<br /><br />In many ways, this film is extremely timely.",1
"A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be [[gruesome]] death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />[[Make-up]] effects artist and monster creator, John Carl [[Buechler]] [[directs]] this supernatural [[slasher]] without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his ""dump in the woods"" scene and current unemployment status.",0
"[[Emilio]] is a successful business [[man]], a perfect [[father]] and a good husband. Or that is what [[everybody]] think. The [[perfect]] storyline he has carefully built all [[along]] these years will start [[closing]] [[around]] him all of a sudden. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies?<br /><br />This is a very well [[laid]] out [[drama]], with great acting and steady direction. Even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension, the movie explores some of our [[worst]] [[fears]]... Do we really know the people we deal with? Can we be so sure?<br /><br />The story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where Emilio is not in control of his lies anymore. A good deal of [[Spanish]] movies have interesting stories but are far from technical proficiency. The perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible, we get inside Emilio, and hate him, and suffer for him, as his situation gets more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is this an attempt to create a Hollywood style flick. This is real [[Spain]], 2002, and regardless the obvious unlikeliness of Emilio's life existing in reality, there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be. Not just a great commercial product, it will let you wondering where lies can get us to. Can we keep up?<br /><br />Well done.",1
"[[I]] got this on a double feature DVD called ""[[Scream]] [[Theater]]"" and it's no [[doubt]] one of the most terrible [[movies]] [[I've]] [[ever]] [[seen]]. And [[I've]] [[seen]] some really [[bad]] ones.

"[[WEll]] first and for most I'd just [[like]] to say that I'm back out of [[retirement]] from [[writing]] [[well]] deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie in [[titled]] ""Scarecrow gone wild"" [[could]] bring me [[back]], so here [[I]] am.<br /><br />[[With]] that being [[said]], I like to start off with this [[comment]]. [[OUCH]]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really horrible, [[I]] [[mean]] I [[know]] it was [[going]] to be bad. But [[I]] had no [[idea]] that I [[would]] be spending 60 [[minutes]] out of a possible [[90]] minute [[film]] laughing at what [[I]] [[thought]] was a horror movie.<[[br]] /><br />[[Let's]] start with the biggest flaw of the [[film]] (to me that is). [[Ken]] Shamrock. Now if [[memory]] [[serves]] me correctly, Shamrock is [[one]] of the [[worlds]] most dangerous [[men]]. Now if memory serves me again, he was also in this [[stupid]] [[movie]] being a stupid [[comic]] relief (or [[that's]] how it [[looked]] to me). [[I]] [[mean]] how [[else]] do you [[explain]] all of his [[lines]]. My all [[time]] favorite [[line]] of his in this so called movie was ""[[It's]] been a [[long]] [[time]] [[coming]]"". OK????????? [[The]] [[funnest]] thing about that line was that no more then [[five]] minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the [[beach]] [[talking]] to the soon to be dead kids about how the [[dam]] scarecrow [[could]] not be killed. [[So]] if he has [[knowledge]] of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he [[sees]] it (the [[scarecrow]] that it). Like [[I]] said before, he must have been the comic relief, except [[I]] don't [[think]] his [[UFC]] [[buddies]] where laughing.<br /><br />Now that I've finished that [[well]] deserved paragraph on to the [[movie]].<br /><br />[[I'll]] [[admit]] that [[I]] can't remember a lot of [[scenes]], and [[that's]] not [[good]] considering that [[I]] just watch the movie no more then [[fifteen]] minutes ago. [[So]] what [[I'm]] going to do is [[list]] the top five [[things]] [[wrong]] with this film 1. Usually when horror [[movie]] [[monster]] have their own [[theme]] [[music]], it's not heard by the [[victims]] or even by the [[monster]] itself. So why were just about [[every]] person [[involved]] in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. [[I]] mean I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. Why on earth were there murders on a beach. I'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. But I guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. Plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. I mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. The girl running in the gray sweat pants. That really bother during the duration of this film. I mean she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. I mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. People trying to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I don't' remember the whole scene, but from what I do remember it was not pretty. This one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. The funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. I mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the ""token black guy"". And that's sad because if I'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all into his new song or whatever. In the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. And boy does he look pi**ed off at this. I mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do about this jealousy, well I'm glad you ask. He wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. I don't want to give the death scene away, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. This movie was way longer then I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. I mean I'll admit, I didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping that the film was over and done with. But no they had to do they twist s**t. Needless to say that when I say that coming, I just turned off the T.V. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. Thanks to my rather fast judgment I can say that I'll never know what was to happen next. But I promise that I do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.",0
"[[I]] have yet to [[watch]] STARCRASH ([[1979]]) - that notoriously cheesy Italian [[take]] on STAR WARS ([[1977]]) - but it can't be much [[worse]] than this misbegotten piece of [[junk]] which, suffice it to say, [[makes]] Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS (1987) [[look]] [[like]] a veritable [[work]] of art! In fact, the [[main]] reason why GALAXINA is [[remembered]] at all nowadays is because of the tragic fate which befell its [[leading]] [[lady]] - Playboy centerfold [[Dorothy]] Stratten who was killed by her insanely jealous estranged husband - before the film had even had its official premiere! <br /><br />[[Although]] Statten (who subsequently had two biopics made about her wherein she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, for the first half of the film she is reduced to being propped up in a chair ostensibly driving a spaceship on a 27-year journey to some planet or other; in fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android who also serves the wacky crew their snacks, gets them all hot under the collar and even goes scouting for the Blue Star (cue choral music) once they land! Having said that, Statten certainly [[looks]] [[luminous]] in her white attire and, even if her role hardly demands much exertion of any acting talent she might possess, it's not exactly demeaning either.<br /><br />Still, it's ironic that for a film which bears her name, she is overshadowed by the campy and would-be zany antics of her fellow crew members, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of the level of comedy on display here), a long-eared, wing-sporting colored guy, a pot-smoking, proverb-quoting old Chinaman and, best of all (relatively speaking) a foul-mouthed, rock-eating, hairy alien creature they hold prisoner. The villain of the piece is a metal-clad non-entity who does, however, have the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music following his every mention of the Blue Star, exclaims, ""What is this s**t?"" There is [[little]] point in [[listing]] the sci-fi classics which are mauled by this [[stinker]] in its ludicrous attempts at spoofing the genre since they are not only lame but obvious; incredibly enough, a chest-busting but ultimately benign alien is apparently played by diminutive Hollywood veteran, Angelo Rossitto!<br /><br />For what it's worth, then, the scenes shot on the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western set than a planetary landscape) have a yellowish, sun-like hue and its inhabitants are 'human gourmets' (delicacies on their menu include Skin and Tonic, Scotsman on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Baked Alaskan, etc), not to mention a motorcycle gang who serve their own particular deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape on the back of it, they dare not shoot at them for fear of hitting their ""Lord"".

"Thankfully [[I]] [[watched]] this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the [[worst]] scenes (aka most of the film, actually).

"I hesitated seeing this movie, having really enjoyed the original, 'Mostly Martha'. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. The original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. No reservations felt like it never connected. The food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. In Mostly Martha, the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. It was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. See the [[original]] - it's a truly enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.",0
"""ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ""! If IMDb would allow one-word reviews, that's what mine would be. This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. The [[singing]], the [[story]], everything is [[dull]] and washed out--just [[like]] this public domain print. Like other comedy team films with [[roots]] in traditional kids stories (such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE [[STOOGES]] and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age [[well]]. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! So my advice is DON'T watch this film. If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for A&C GO TO MARS) would be an [[improvement]].",0

"I can't believe the amount of reviewers who [[praise]] this as [[realistic]]. I'm a million miles from being an expert, and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading Into Thin Air, and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest docs [[meant]] that this film just got more and more [[ridiculous]] as it went on. There is some good [[climbing]] footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film ""How much experience above 8000 metres do you have?"", I was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate [[man-vs-nature]] odyssey. Instead you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no acclimatisation; climbing with goggles off in full sun, and they are barely ever out of [[breath]] performing miraculous feats of endurance. Only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as an afterthought. If you have no knowledge of mountaineering, give it a look: be prepared for some clichéd heroics (although no more clichéd than a hundred other passably diverting flicks), and a clichéd outcome. I've been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching K2; but other than some amazingly beautiful [[scenery]], it was a [[let]] down because it was so far removed from reality. I can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie, but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the [[heroic]], and sadly [[fantastical]] storyline.

"Rutger Hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category, and rather obviously so, so it needs a lot of help.<br /><br />The beginning holds a lot more promise, of a film that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got hooked into the beginning. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from great and intriguing to basically [[nowhere]].<br /><br />It's fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. I'm sure that will be enough for many people. The problem is it all feels contrived and empty which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization.

"[[I]] remember a [[time]] when the only [[thing]] that did [[exist]] where [[clubs]], drugs pubs and parties. This [[movie]] came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing. If i had never discovered the ravier side of [[things]] this movie [[may]] not have made sense to me. That night when i watched it for the 1st time, with some mates, i was completely blown away. I had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time. [[Almost]] everything i could relate to in some way. There was [[never]] 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another. My mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them. We had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in HT. We where coming down while we watched and when the movie ""came down"" i remember actually coming down a bit further. it was [[actually]] [[quite]] depressing in our room during those ""low points"". Thats what's so [[good]] about [[Human]] [[Traffic]]. it really [[taps]] the whole situation.<br /><br />its a [[unique]] movie in the way its not plot driven, but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important. it [[always]] seemed to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to the lostness in the same way. work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. for them its their holiday. But the reality is you cant truly escape. Another situation they all have to face.<br /><br />Me and my mates where no different from these guys. We all had our own stuff going on. [[Human]] [[traffic]] helped explain to us what we didn't understand about our selves. It does it in a [[way]] that doesn't talk down to you. It made us feel like we weren't the only ones out there like us and that the lessons learned where [[ones]] many others, from all over the world, had gone thru. it wasn't until my [[lifestyle]] changed from party popper to [[career]] driven that i would fully understand this movie. these days i watch HT, every now and then(as i just have), and reminisce the old days.

"Empty shortening of John Irving's [[novel]] strives for profundity courageously but ends up being [[absurd]]. It's a quirky, [[goofy]] and bittersweet string of sketches, attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close.(The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over as Garp reaches adulthood.) The story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. Williams gives a cherub-faced performance. This [[script]] was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. He's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. John Lithgow's [[role]] as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, [[also]] doesn't make sense. This movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies. Williams had recently shed his Mork and Mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. Audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.",0
"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.<br /><br />On the whole, Ali G Indahouse is hilarious British comedy at its best - and funniest, and most clever. A great job! 9/10",1
"The film [[opens]] with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power, and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such harm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)[[begins]] a rather [[blossoming]] [[romance]] with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge, passed down from mom, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save [[Sherri]] before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare.<br /><br />Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and [[I]] must agree with his [[detractors]] that, just from this film alone, it seems he holds them together with [[paper]] [[clips]] and [[Elmer's]] glue. The [[animation]] with which we see the [[spirit]] [[take]] [[control]] of [[Sherri]] is beyond awful and rather [[laughable]]. A little soft-core nonsense as filler, some [[demonic]] possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's [[possessed]]), with naughty [[nurse]] [[behavior]](..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a [[little]] bit [[violence]]/gore. The [[film]] is [[essentially]] shot in tiny [[rooms]] with dull dialogue from a rather [[mundane]] cast. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and [[Al]] [[often]] shoots them without revealing all that [[much]]. [[The]] film looks [[embarrassingly]] [[cheap]] and there's an absence of [[thrills]], although the [[chilling]] score(..which [[sounds]] like something from Dark Shadows)does help a [[little]] bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who [[seems]] to be a nymphomaniac if she'll [[even]] screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated ""lost"" [[version]] which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.",0
"[[For]] me, [[reviewing]] [[movies]] is an [[extension]] of my [[love]] of film--and of [[horror]] [[cinema]], in [[particular]]. The [[reviews]] [[I've]] [[written]] [[thus]] [[far]] have been for [[films]] that [[I]] love, respect, and [[admire]], and I have [[eagerly]] rewarded them with [[glowing]] [[accolades]] and [[perfect-ten]] [[ratings]]. A life-long horror [[movie]] [[fan]], it is a [[tremendous]] [[pleasure]] for me to be [[able]] to [[share]] with others my thoughts and [[ideas]] about [[great]] horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in [[exposing]] people to movies they may not otherwise [[seek]] out. I only recently [[began]] reviewing films for the [[IMDB]], and it was my [[initial]] intention to [[concentrate]] only on my own [[personal]] favorites, [[examining]] those which [[I]] [[believe]] are of substance and of lasting [[value]] to the horror genre. [[However]], the existence of [[films]] [[like]] ""[[Graduation]] [[Day]]"" is, without pun, a [[thorn]] in my side. Completely [[devoid]] of any [[merit]] [[whatsoever]], this [[1981]] [[hodgepodge]] of [[unformed]] ideas is [[amateurishly]] [[directed]], [[poorly]] acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema. During the [[brief]] [[couple]] of years before and after this [[movie's]] release, we saw the appearance of [[domestic]] (and Canadian) films such as ""Halloween [[II]],"" ""Prom Night,"" ""Terror Train,"" ""Madman,"" ""[[My]] Bloody [[Valentine]],"" ""[[The]] [[Prowler]],"" ""[[Just]] [[Before]] Dawn,"" ""Final Exam,"" and ""[[Hell]] Night,"" among others. [[These]] [[films]], though of varying degrees of quality, [[clearly]] [[strove]] to achieve [[something]] in terms of story [[line]], plotting, acting, [[direction]], and overall tone. [[Not]] [[every]] movie released during this bountiful season of the Slasher Era would be of the artistic [[merit]] or [[commercial]] success of the [[original]] ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th,"" but these films were all [[well-made]] and [[clearly]] contributed to the [[ongoing]] development of horror [[cinema]]. ""Graduation [[Day]],"" an abysmal farce about a [[masked]] killer stalking members of a [[high]] [[school]] track team, was directed by [[Herb]] Freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the [[horror]] genre with such a [[travesty]]. The [[task]] of [[creating]] worthwhile horror [[films]] is best left to those who have a genuine [[love]] and respect for the [[genre]]. This [[movie]] fails [[miserably]] on every [[possible]] [[level]], not the least of which are dreadfully wooden [[performances]], dime-store [[special]] [[effects]], an irritating [[musical]] score, and, most of all, a [[story]] lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. A pointless exercise in how to waste film, ""Graduation Day"" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema.",0

"After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. ""Etude In Black"" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />Last week I reviewed ""Just Married"" and compared it unfavourably to ""Meet The Parents"". Well here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch extra characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely [[divine]] as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of ""Etude In Black"" just how well the pair worked together!",1
"I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting super bug budget, no storyline Batman's either)<br /><br />A couple of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpion can be added to that collection.<br /><br />If you've seen the Demolitionist then get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It even stars the same guy in both movies)<br /><br />If you haven't, then let me explain...a cop's father is murdered and she seeks vengeance. She laces up the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks absolutely great on Joan Severance) and goes out to kick some booty.<br /><br />It's a fun, action [[packed]] movie, mind you, you may not wish the kids to see it...without screening it first to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene Severance has in it. Which in my opinion, was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)",1

"The Hebrew Hammer is a clever idea [[wasted]], as the execution is weak. As if often the case with [[iconoclastic]] humor, it relies overly on outrage to generate laughs, which simply isn't enough. Poor-taste humor has two elements -- poor taste and humor -- and both are needed here, but the humor is pretty [[scarce]]. As a result, it is often [[painful]] to watch, all the more so because of good attempts on the part of the performers, particularly Adam Goldberg as the HH himself. The Shaft references are funny, though, but only to those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry The Hebrew Hammer.<br /><br />Another problem is that many of the jokes rely on knowledge of American Jewish culture, and many in the audience will simply not understand the jokes.",0
"In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. Within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. We are also [[swept]] away by [[powerfully]] performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema being what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called [[gratuitous]]. A great film it may be, but [[mainstream]] viewing it is not.",1
"This [[movie]] is just about as [[good]] as the first [[Jackass]], but with [[slightly]] more disgusting [[skits]]. I wouldn't say this was as good as the first, but it came very close. Jackass [[fans]] will not be disappointed, but if you didn't like the first movie, you will hate this one. There are scenes that will be seen as Jackass [[classics]] (the elderly suits with ""additions"", the ""cab ride"", and many others), and those that you will wish you [[never]] watched (eating crap, drinking semen, etc...) Overall this movie was a [[good]] watch, and I am glad I got to see it. I'm [[sure]] this movie will not have the best rating due to [[critics]] that rate it (I sat in the press section and most of the older viewers seemed disgusted), but don't let that stop you from enjoying it.",1
"I'm astounded and dismayed by the number of reviewers on this site who did not get the point of Black Snake Moan. It's not about black/white relationships or old/young relationships, though I think director Craig Brewer deliberately threw in both elements to tweak imagined taboos. It's not about sexual abuse or sex addiction, though Christina Ricci's character, Rae, typifies those. It's not about folk religion in the black community, though religion plays a large role. It's not a love story, though there are not one, but two happy couples at the end. And it's certainly not about the south, where ""everything is hotter,"" though it's set in the south and it's undeniably hot; holy smokes, even the tag-line writers didn't get the point.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is a parable about Mississippi Delta Blues; who feels them, who writes them, who plays them, what they're playing about, how it heals them.<br /><br />It's as though the film producers sat down with a blank slate and asked, ""Ok, if we were going to help people understand what the Blues are really about, what would it look like?"" So they set it in the rural south. Then they dream up two characters, one whose wife left him to live with his best friend, the other who goes off to war and his badly abused girl sleeps with everybody in town. Then, we throw in grizzled worldliness touched just a little by folk religion (they know Jesus wants their lives, and though they respect Him, they know they can't give Him that), some violence between men and women, and lots and lots of steamy sexual images, including -- ready to go over the top? -- a black man in a sleeveless undershirt holding a half-naked white girl captive on the end of a 40 lb chain. Fill it with authentic delta blues sounds, make it about a genuine blues picker, use music as the main healing element in the plot, slap clips of blues-man Son House on both ends, and Voila -- you have a modern parable about what the Blues are all about. Even the film's climax is not character conflict, but the whole town dancing steamy dances to hot, raunchy blues.<br /><br />Of course, there's a bit of a dilemma here. Rae (Ricci) is being destroyed by uncontrollable lust, and is being healed by Lazarus' (Jackson's) homey religion and steadfastness (and don't forget the chain.) But then, we're shown the restored Rae dancing raunchily to blues at the end. Is this an expression of a restored, healthy life force, or just more of the same trashy behavior that ruined her in the first place? Brewer wants it both ways, but blues really is about sex and violence, not to mention depression. I suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both (sex and violence) without unleashing either. I have my doubts.<br /><br />Not for the first time, Samuel L Jackson plays so well that we forget we're watching Samuel L Jackson; the man is unbelievably good. He even picks some of his own tunes in the film, and his playing is authentic, dirty, and hot. Christina Ricci isn't usually this good, either. Granted, half her job is done by the Costume That Wasn't There and her slinky figure, but she's a marvelous combination of cynical lust, rebellion, and vulnerability; bravo to her, she's arrived. I was impressed by the country preacher, John Cothran, Jr. I had to check the database to assure myself that he's a professional actor and not a genuine country minister.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of what they're getting if their kids bring this one home. The language is pretty far off the charts, the first half-hour is full of graphic sex, and women are violated in a dozen ways during the course of the film (Lazarus means well and is decent, but honestly, chaining a woman to the radiator?) Plus, Ricci spends half the movie dressed for sex; if you've got teenage boys, they'll be licking the screen halfway into the film. I don't recommend this for kids of any age. Adults only, please.<br /><br />That being said, Black Snake Moan is informative and accurate about blues, folk religion, and sexual abuse, and tells a tale that's redemptive in lots of ways. It's unorthodox, but well worth the time. And, my goodness, is the sound track hot.",1
"Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another driver. Stanley Adams might want to put him on his team of racers, but the other drivers aren't for having him around.<br /><br />Desperate for employment Fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner Jan Murray who's paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on Fabian's bad rep. He's got to take it, but Annette Funicello who's Murray's daughter provides another reason to stick around.<br /><br />The rest of the film is Fabian's struggle to get back to the NASCAR circuit while at the same time juggling both Annette and his current girl friend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has it all over Annette.<br /><br />Thunder Alley is helped by location shooting at the southern NASCAR tracks and good film footage of NASCAR racing. Not helped by a rather [[silly]] story which delves into the real reason for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from same.<br /><br />Still fans of NASCAR might go for this.",0

A 10 year old roams a bizarro America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the screenwriter delights in making you squirm. I remained unaffected, due to the broad acting. You know you're in for it when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most appealing perfs. (And what did this kid's screen test look like? He's insufferable.)

"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining. In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years. While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not. When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin. As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /><br />MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB give a [[great]] example of pre-teens, [[teens]] and young [[adults]] living their summer with no [[concerns]] other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college. [[The]] opening title [[song]] that goes ""Are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks..."" describes [[exactly]] how summer is viewed by school kids. <br /><br />I [[personally]] enjoyed the two campers [[Spaz]] and Fink. What [[boy]], [[nerd]] or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty [[girl]] [[camper]]? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are somewhat over the top I [[bet]] [[everybody]] who watches the [[film]] [[can't]] help but to like these [[two]] [[guys]]. These two [[characters]] are a mix of Charlie Brown from [[PEANUTS]] and [[Jack]] Tripper & Larry Dallas from [[THREE'S]] COMPANY. I [[would]] [[bet]] that most viewers even cheer for [[Spaz]] in the egg carrying competition and for [[Fink]] as he attempts to ""beat the stomach"" in the [[hot]] dog [[eating]] contest. <br /><br />Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors. No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing. It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.",1

"I first heard about Commander's Log when I was on the concom for the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks, and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making TV on a shoestring budget. I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the chance to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, since the first seasons of Red Dwarf were also shot on a low budget (although Commander's Log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time), and thus have to make up for the lack of ""eye candy"" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Petty Officer Blather, does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona.<br /><br />Bowlsby's original idea was for the story to be told in two minute ""interstitials"", shown in between other shows over the course of an evening, although for some reason, Space didn't get how cool an idea this would have been, and so the [[interstitials]] were all rolled up into a one-hour show, which Space normally showed in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD doesn't include episode 3 (which premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (which was previewed at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you're in touch with your local fannish community, you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you.",1

"It is interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of Clive Barker's writing). Even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so, the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that [[need]] standard Hollywood plot hooks, and [[layered]], so that if you expect to be fed, you will see a [[normal]] [[monster]] [[flick]] with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.<br /><br />Those who need a linear, specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie, because the story lies, like in the [[novella]], partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in comments and the imagination.<br /><br />Another [[possible]] hang-up is the ending, of which I can say, without spoiling it, that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. It is, in fact, not very defined at all, which I know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened, but to me, and to many others, I'm sure, just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, in addition, the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.<br /><br />There is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. Summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.<br /><br />I [[love]] this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. I'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.",1

"It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched ""The Crime Doctor's Courage"" all the way through. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever. I guess that's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.<br /><br />The ""Crime Doctor"" is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast. He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's. Though the story location is California, the Braggas appear to live in a castle!<br /><br />There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but I won't divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (even though I can think of many, many, B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the ""Crime Doctor"" series, so I can't make any comparisons.",0

[[The]] [[answer]] isn't far away, as in the next scene we move to a funeral parlor, where the [[next]] [[stunning]] fashion statement [[comes]] in a sexy off-the-shoulders black dress worn by one of the mourners.<br /><br />Aggressively inappropriate costuming isn't the film's only [[flaw]]. The dialog is a treat for connoisseurs of [[bad]] writing. ""You turn my tears into wine,"" is a sample gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering that one with a straight face.<br /><br />The director reinforces every cheeseball scene with what is possibly the schmaltziest soundtrack score ever recorded, which veers from embarrassingly maudlin in the dialog scenes to cheesy groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transitional scenes.<br /><br />The script introduces characters with no rhyme or reason and story beats are doled out as if with a broken ladle.<br /><br />Let's not forget this is a ""horror"" film, though. Our characters find themselves in a forest wherein lurks Dr. Chopper and his two ""scary"" henchwomen, who are supposed to be some kind of Frankencreatures but look exactly like Valley Girls with fake blood dabbed beneath their Supercut shags. I've honestly seen scarier make-up on eight-year-olds out trick-or-treating on Halloween.<br /><br />And again we get a whiff of the costume designer's malodorous handiwork, as Valley Ghoul One prances around in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend smock while her buddy wears a nondescript ensemble that might have been almost fashionable in less hip corners of the 1980s.<br /><br />Dr. Chopper makes the big fashion statement though, looking like a Crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black Harley, clad from head to toe in zippered black S&M leather.<br /><br />If this sounds intriguing, by all means check it out. There is plenty of side-splitting and belabored dialog (like the precious ""elephant's graveyard"" scene or the ""intellectual"" discourse on Ginsburg).<br /><br />To be fair, the cinematography is good, considering what was put before the camera, and the actors strive (with wildly extreme results) to make something from a scrap heap of clichés and inanities. You do have to wonder if they were really really stupid or just blindly desperate, not to walk off the set after catching one glimpse of the ridiculous-looking villains with their 99 Cent Store weapons.",0

"[[This]] movie will likely be too [[sentimental]] for [[many]] [[viewers]], [[especially]] [[contemporary]] [[audiences]]. [[Nevertheless]] [[I]] enjoyed this [[film]] [[thanks]] [[mostly]] to the down-to-earth charm of [[William]] Holden, [[one]] of my favorite [[stars]], and the dazzling [[beauty]] of Jennifer [[Jones]]. There are some [[truly]] [[heartwarming]] [[scenes]] between the pair and the [[talent]] of these [[two]] actors [[rescues]] what in [[lesser]] [[hands]] could've been [[trite]] lines. The [[cinematography]] of [[Hong]] Kong from the period of filming is [[another]] highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than [[average]] [[romantic]] drama, [[7]]/10.",1
"This is [[without]] a [[doubt]] the worst movie [[I]] have [[ever]] [[seen]]. I say this without [[hyperbole]], and [[believe]] me, [[I've]] [[seen]] a [[lot]] of [[bad]] [[movies]]. [[It's]] embarrassing and [[annoying]] that millions of [[dollars]] went into this film and that [[hundreds]] (thousands?) of craftspeople spent so [[much]] [[time]] working on what the writers and [[producers]] MUST have [[known]] would be a [[colossal]] [[failure]].<[[br]] /><br />When a 90 [[minute]] [[film]] feels this [[long]], [[drawn]] out, [[boring]], and [[incomprehensible]], you know that [[something]] went wrong [[somewhere]]. [[Also]], [[Jamie]] [[Kennedy]] ([[whose]] [[work]] I've enjoyed [[elsewhere]]) is simply terrible in this role; he was [[obviously]] never [[given]] a [[screen]] test, because no producer in their [[right]] [[mind]] would consider him [[entertaining]] in any way, especially in the guise of [[The]] [[Mask]]. [[Simply]] awful.<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[Personally]], [[I]] can't wait to see the [[reviews]] by the major [[film]] [[critics]], because I know they're do a better job than me at tearing this [[train]] [[wreck]] to shreds.<[[br]] /><br />The [[producers]] of this film should be [[embarrassed]], and more importantly, NEVER be [[allowed]] to make theatrical films again.",0
"This show [[reminds]] me of an episode of ""The Simpsons,"" where Smithers had just been fired by Mr. Burns and was forced to live a miserable life being unemployed. All he did to while the way the hours was to drink and watch Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic TV channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time. ""Mind of Mencia"" is [[slightly]] better than most of Comedy Central's programming, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is low-quality filler for people with absolutely no [[lives]]. <br /><br />Truth be told, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who [[throws]] out trite, soft-ball ethnic jokes and cashes in on bland stereotypes of people based on their race, gender, or economic status, or a combination of two out of three of these characteristics. If you've heard one of these jokes by one of your friends at a bar or at work, believe me, you've [[heard]] what passes as comedy on ""Mind of Mencia."" [[Carlos]] also tries to make fun of current events, but [[lacks]] creativity or originality. This is not to say that Carlos is a washout all the time. I [[found]] some of his skits amusing, such as his rap video portrayal as an oil sheik. If you find [[bland]], [[run-of-the-mill]] comedy up your alley, you'll probably enjoy ""Mind of Mencia."" For those people who are tired of repetitive, pedestrian comedians trotting out the same old time-worn jokes, stay away.",0
"This [[movie]] is ageless and would probably appeal to children [[today]], [[even]] if there isn't a [[Jedi]] in the entire thing. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her [[acting]] is [[great]] too. Even Mickey Rooney is good; so are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The [[world]] was a different [[place]] when this movie was [[released]], and it certainly is a great place to visit.",1
"[[An]] [[amazing]] film, I've only just seen it and I [[already]] want to see it again. [[I'd]] never [[heard]] of Derek [[Jarman]] before I saw this film but now I am, [[I]] can't wait to [[see]] his [[others]]. The film [[takes]] a whole new perspective of Shakespeare's The Tempest, I'm sure he'd have appreciated it for Jarman's use of the the play's themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. OK, OK there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which I hadn't really anticipated but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable. One Spoiler (for those of a nervous disposition: [[Fast]] forward the flashback [[scene]] with Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, its pretty graphic. Overall, if you are starting to [[find]] [[Kenneth]] Branagh's Shakespeare performances flaccid and [[monotonous]] then you need to see this [[film]]. Fantastic and surreal, [[it'll]] blow you away, but only if you let it. Have an [[open]] mind - and then [[let]] this [[film]] work it's magic on you.",1
"Komodo vs. Cobra is not going to set the world on fire. It's not a hallmark of cinema history. What it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such I give these efforts a lot of slack. I mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. Not a lot of big budget films getting made there. BUT-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever [[lame]] American monster flick needs affordable SFX. And I get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. If for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where Pare and company are walking through a ""jungle."" Look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of ""AI Assault"" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. I can admire the [[thriftiness]] of these films. Every dollar really does show up on the screen! Too bad there just aren't enough dollars......",0
"The most [[amazing]] film I have ever seen. I didn't read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident. I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw. I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about ""punishment park"" in the U.S. It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the US if you are from Europe. I must admit that I felt really anti-american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way.",1
"Sean [[Connery]] is very good as the Great Raisuli, Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful. This is an adventure movie with Arabs, Germans and the USMC all coming to grips at one point or another. There is also a lot of [[humor]] in the interplay among the main and supporting characters. The story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy Greek-American businessman was kidnapped by the Raisuli in the early 1900s. Milius has substituted Candace Bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping, and this opens the story to a lot of literary license.<br /><br />On the other hand, the [[movie]] gives Milius the opportunity to remind the [[viewer]] of two of the most famous (though [[mostly]] forgotten) political quotations of the TR era. Brian Keith (very [[good]] as TR) says, ""Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead!""; and John Huston (also good as Sec of State John Hay)asks the Japanese Ambassador at a White House dinner, ""You likee knifee, you likee forkee?""",1
"83 minutes? [[Nope]], this thing is [[72]] minutes, tops.<br /><br />If you cannot [[guess]] the killer in this movie, you had [[better]] throw your [[TV]] out the window, because you ain't learned nothing in 20+ years of [[cinematic]] [[slasher]] history.<br /><br />And how come the plain [[star]] who never gets naked is always the [[one]] you want to get naked?",0
"[[I]] had to [[suffer]] through this [[movie]] [[three]] [[times]] while [[I]] was a [[zombie]] [[extra]] in the director's new movie [[After]] Sundown.

I [[could]] not take it any more I busted out laughing right in [[front]] of the guy. [[The]] [[movie]] has no [[direction]] whatsoever and the one thing that [[could]] make this [[movie]] [[decent]] (Female [[Nudity]]) was nowhere to be [[found]]. I am a [[fan]] of [[low]] [[budget]] horror movies, but this was just too much for me. The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. [[Also]] do not expect the [[new]] movie to be any better.",0
"This [[documentary]] was neither professionally nor objectively made. The whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by IBM to win the match in question just to make some money. Garry Kasparov has an ego problem. He was puffed up before the match and when he lost, he didn't like it. I remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win. As time went on, I started to lose and didn't [[like]] it. Today, I simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good. Not only that, the games are [[uninteresting]] and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities. This documentary keeps [[showing]] us images of The Turk which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being. From the start until the end we are lead to believe that IBM short of literally hid a human GM in the back of their cupboard-sized computer. I'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because Garry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It's not magic and it's no mystery. They can be trained, have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. It's really no surprise that Deep Blue won. Perhaps at the time it was. If it happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of machines; people would hardly blink. If a machine couldn't at least draw with a GM today, people would think the program was weak.",0
"[[Bill]], Jeremy [[Theobald]], is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.<br /><br />Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that [[he's]] been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills [[Bill's]] [[lonely]] life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows [[religiously]] when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. <br /><br />One day Bill follows [[Cobb]], Alex [[Haw]], home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. <br /><br />Amazingly [[good]] low-budget [[movie]] made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in [[Hollywood]] with his [[ground-breaking]] and original motion picture classic ""Momento"" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. <br /><br />""Following"" is actually a much better movie then ""Momento"" because it's a conventional and [[easy]] to follow story. [[Compared]] to ""[[Momento's]]"" which was at [[first]] [[confusing]] and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. Whats makes ""Following"" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. [[The]] [[movie]] is [[far]] more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like ""Momento"" did. ""Following"" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.<br /><br />Made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars.",1
"[[Notorious]] HK [[CATIII]] [[actor]], Anthony Wong, is for once (well...not actually once - he was a cop in the [[DAUGHTER]] OF DARKNESS films and a few others...)not a [[psychopathic]] weirdo in EROTIC NIGHTMARE. Usually recognized for his role as a [[complete]] wackadoo in such CATIII ""nasties"" like THE UNTOLD STORY and [[THE]] EBOLA SYNDROME - this time, [[Wong]] is on the receiving-end of the nastiness...<br /><br />Wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams, for a [[price]]. True to his word, the dreams that Wong has involve having mad donkey sex with [[smokin']] hot schoolgirls - but the dreams come with a price that's more than money. The sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost, blackmails Wong out of his cash and business, kills his family, and eventually kills Wong himself...Wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on, and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer - but as it turns out - Wong's brother is a pretty dope-ass sorcerer himself, and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife - turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes...<br /><br />EROTIC [[NIGHTMARE]] is one of the more [[enjoyable]] CATIII films I've seen in a while. Absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other CATIII entries like RED TO KILL, THE UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter, is more ""fun"" then some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable to ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - a more ""carefree"" CATIII entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore, without being overly comedic either. Definitely worth a look, especially to the genre enthusiast. 8/10",1
"Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case, I'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a [[worthy]] choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British/Spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood though, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon, he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as well, there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way, fancy that.<br /><br />What this results in of course is a more adventure style approach. The concentration is less on the workings of the English military with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, hob nobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby.<br /><br />This slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.",1
"Lifeforce (1985) was a Cannon funded film directed by Tobe Hooper. It's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to Earth during the latest space shuttle mission. Steve Railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy. But really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May. She's one smoking hot [[number]]. The director was a huge fan of Female Vampire (a.k.a. Erotikill). Miss May recreates Lina Romay's title role The film is beautifully photographed and directed. There's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy.<br /><br />I have to give this film a very high rating. Tobe Hooper was the man. He made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period (Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars as well). If you like science fiction/horror films, Tobe Hooper films or Mathilda May this film's just up your alley.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation!<br /><br />Did I mention Mathilda May is smoking hot?",1

"I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily, my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy...silly comedy, and surprises.

"A film that reveals the unease of modern men and women in life when confronted to death. We are beyond the simple religious belief in the afterlife, and what's more in any kind of hell or heaven. Religion is declared dead. Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can push it away for quite a long time. What's more the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. That was quite typical of the end of the 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States himself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists speaks of their search for truth and qualifies that truth as being of course relative because it is more a quest than a final end, objective or achievement. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thinking that was starting to evolve into a truth obsession, an obsessive conception that truth was unique and irreversibly reachable. Post modernism had not reached Hollywood yet, though today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go into death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactivates old guilty feelings and frustrations that had been buried into the unconscious. One has to do with a drug addicted father of a Vietnam veteran who commits suicide, another with a young boy who was stoned to death by some others the death tripper included, another still with a young black girl who was victimized and bullied in grade school out of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in front of her shyness. It is so naïve that you could cry out of shame for these young adults who are highly qualified and behave like babies who are crying for their bottles of edulcorated fruit juice. The film though is interesting but in something quite different. The setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of any detail is baroque, morbid, decadent, quite in the style of ""Death in Venice"" or Greenaway, or some other works of art that deal with making friends with the basic enemy that death is. Of course that does not save the film but at least that makes it worth watching.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",1

"[[When]] [[one]] of my friends [[recommended]] this to me, raving about how [[well]] it was [[filmed]], the underlying [[themes]] and the [[general]] [[greatness]] of the [[film]], [[I]] [[obviously]] [[expected]] an [[amazing]], at [[least]] [[entertaining]] film.<br /><br />The [[two]] [[hours]] [[I]] [[spent]] watching this [[turned]] out to be a [[huge]] disappointing waste of my [[time]].<br /><br />[[I]] understand that this movie is meant to be [[surreal]], but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest.

"This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. It isn't. Instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene where Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) Some characters are more entertaining than others. The best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, does some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his pursuit of the profound. It's a long trip, which drags in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie I've ever seen. And the finale [[hardly]] makes it seem worth while, at all.<br /><br />I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll learn me.

He is the [[hero]], the most [[charming]], [[disarming]] rickshaw [[driver]] you will [[ever]] [[encounter-]] he's [[magical]]. A lovely, real, sweet, [[incredibly]] talented actor who I cannot wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!",1
"Might contain spoilers.<br /><br />This is just a [[good]] movie. Lots of good silly stuff to laugh at. However, do not watch the TV version, they cut to much out. Dom Deluise is rather awesome as the mafia Don who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long drive from Jersey. Also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox.<br /><br />[[Any]] [[bad]] stuff? The rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated. The [[songs]] were [[rather]] lame. One time while watching this movie, I could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or 2. <br /><br />On the whole, however, an enjoyable movie experience. A must watch for comedy fans.",1
"Even for the non-opera loving public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men. But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire, the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by Prosper Mérimée in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda ('Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love','Amantes', 'If they tell you I fell', etc.). Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - José - provides just the right vantage for the story of this [[famous]] gypsy wild [[lady]] to be told. <br /><br />Carmen (the amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper José (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is stationed. [[Carmen]] is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy, Carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps her pact, providing José with his first sexual encounter, and José is doomed. His lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while, but at his release José encounters Carmen again, kills a fellow officer, and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are Carmen's people. Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behaviors take over, behavior's that include Carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and José comes to a tragic [[end]]. <br /><br />One factor that makes the [[story]] (as [[adapted]] for the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jordà move so well is the role that Prosper [[Mérimée]] ([[Jay]] Benedict) plays: his questioning of José completes the story that Bizet's opera only [[outlines]]. The acting is superb, the cinematography by Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score by José Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film. This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen, and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",1
"I am a glutton for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In fare like this movie. This film, made for very little money it seems, does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail. It is cheezy. It is gory. It has no real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock. There are a few great effects like a shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by a knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth, and one gross-out with a guy getting his eyeballs yanked out. But there is also loads of zombies, and some psycho killers patterned after Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a demon possessed scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people. It has great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's and it still has a cheeze factor that ranks mighty high. Don't expect Romero, just second-rate Fulci. I would say that Horror fans will like it, and it is funny and cheezy and a fast ride through B-movie Land.",1
"From Kreestos: <br /><br />The [[dialog]] is terrible, [[awful]], [[drivel]]. Acting poor. Many plot flaws. I don't [[recommend]] this at all.<br /><br />From Wikipedia:<br /><br />Artistic licenses The working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [1], both of whom were male, not female as depicted in the film.<br /><br />The copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score. In fact, they were berated by Beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Throughout the movie Beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In reality, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. At this point in his life, most of Beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.<br /><br />In the film, Beethoven makes an allusion to the Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism as the Sonata No. 14 ""quasi una fantasia"" was not named ""Moonlight"" until several years after his death.",0
"My girlfriend wanted to see this ([[lol]] this is the case a lot)...so I rented it. Then I saw how acclaimed this was [[nominated]] for 10 [[Oscars]]. GREAT! this should be good ol' drama. This movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. [[But]] once the movie ended, I couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just couldn't [[tolerate]] her [[character]] at all. Warren Beatty was [[excellent]] in the film [[acting-wise]], but again I just found it hard to have sympathy for his character....he just came off essentially as a [[idiotic]], hotheaded loser of a gangster..who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. How'd he get in with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway??? This film just left me with a [[bland]] but uneasy feeling...what was the big deal with this movie? I just didn't feel a completeness with [[Bugsy]]. Beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. I'm guessing that's how Siegel really was....but it was just too much of that. There just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. My basic assessment of it would be <br /><br />""a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'Las Vegas'....but his failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with having no regard for his mob bosses' money gets him killed.""<br /><br />What else is there besides that? I just didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big [[disappointment]]. There must've not been many movies to come out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 Oscars is [[beyond]] me (although the two it won is justifiable). 1.5/4 stars.",0
"I'm a [[collector]] of films starring Ms. Weaver, so I bought this only because of her being in it. I find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many [[awful]] [[movies]]. She started with [[incredible]] promise in Alien but then had a slew of bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two, and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. In the time between Alien and it's 1986 sequel, Aliens, the only movie she did that was worth anything was Ghostbusters. before the release of Aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out. Luckily she wasn't.<br /><br />Back to Eyewitness though, the film is boring. It doesn't create any [[suspense]]. William Hurt seems like a cardboard stand in, and the atmosphere is just to [[dry]]. Sigourney is [[decent]] but [[nothing]] worth remembering.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars like Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.",0
"I usually don't write reviews for shows unless I've seen them in full. However, there were so many positive views of this show on here [[I]] felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism.<br /><br />This show is hysterically [[bad]]. I don't think it was meant to be, but it is. [[I]] see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show, and I honestly can't understand why--- this show is so [[poorly]] [[acted]], the dialogue is so awful, and the plots are thin around their holes.<br /><br />I think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work, which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me.<br /><br />If you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it, anticipating clichéd lines and such, this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule, if you have that sort of time on your hands.<br /><br />The pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show. If the nonsense saccharin cliché ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock, then this may be a show for you.",0
"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*<br /><br />I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we [[glad]] we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a [[perfect]] mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****",1
"[[Engaging]] [[characters]], nice [[animation]], dynamite [[songs]]...all this and cute [[kitties]], too.

[[Among]] them: its [[length]], its technical problems, its [[colossal]] [[mistreatment]] of [[animals]] on set -- the list goes on and on.

It is a classic [[example]] of [[naturalistic]] storytelling on [[par]] with [[Strindberg]] -- its moments lasting as long as they might in [[reality]], having not been dumbed down for [[good]] [[cinematic]] timing.

"I really [[wanted]] to love this film. I have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is marvelous. This film is very far from the book. The book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.<br /><br />In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong, and NEVER does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. That's the POINT of the book! She behaves as a ""princes"" regardless of circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.<br /><br />In the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. Sara does what is right simply BECAUSE it is RIGHT.<br /><br />Outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is VERY hungry. She gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. When she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. She continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 I think - I don't remember how many.<br /><br />The baker is watching through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara.<br /><br />And in the book, her father has died. The man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. Her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find Sara; he takes her and Becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course.<br /><br />Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she remains in her same post at the school. But she is humiliated as Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara does speak to Miss Minchin in the end - Miss Minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs Miss Minchin that she had been cruel.<br /><br />There is no comeuppance for Miss Minchin. She continues on in her miserable existence. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.<br /><br />The book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. It is about self control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This film does NOTHING to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. We were not rewarded.<br /><br />I cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that Shirley Temple acted in. I don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that I do not recognize it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time - buy the book. It is unforgettable... even for a dad!",0
"It's a shame House Calls isn't better [[known]]. Is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle-aged, shopworn, and gun-shy, rather than oversexed teen-stars? Could be. If you're over 35, you'll probably get this comedy. If you're over 45, you're really going to get this comedy. If you're 25, wait until you're older to see it.<br /><br />[[The]] [[unlikely]] pairing of Matthau and Jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely. There's a [[wonderful]] line of [[Matthau's]] that sums up what is happening between the two of them--""I like old broads because you don't have to explain who Ronald Coleman is."" (If that's not the exact line, it's close...)<br /><br />The premise of a sub-par [[hospital]] run by incompetents rings true. Art [[Carney's]] portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely [[brilliant]]. It is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery. Subplots, if you can call them that, are fun too, like between Matthau and Jackson's teenage son. Everything hits just exactly the right tone. <br /><br />Okay, there's the bit where Matthau has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over-the-top and an easy mark.

"I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival 2002. This seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.<br /><br />The story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. Moreover, the characters playing in the [[film]] are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. Not only do they all happen to be good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards Jia are very effective.<br /><br />Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some [[Chinese]] action films late eighties start [[nineties]]. Later you can see him in great films such as Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths Jia becomes a drug addict and [[looses]] all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making [[somewhat]] futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.<br /><br />I like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after [[withdrawal]] more than on the horror of [[drugs]]. [[We]] [[really]] feel the [[pain]] and [[struggle]] [[Jia]] is in. [[At]] the same time we hate him for the way he [[treats]] those around him.<br /><br />The film [[draws]] the viewer into a tiring pattern Jia seems to be [[caught]] in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. Because there are [[personal]] 'interviews' with the characters we feel like we are getting to know Jia not only through himself but through others as well.<br /><br />The film has a heavy feel, but scenes of Jia cycling through Bejing and partying with his friends [[lighten]] the tone. So does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. The music is [[beautiful]] and stayed with me for a while after. This is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and [[modern]] Chinese [[film]] this is a [[strong]] [[recommendation]].",1
"""Return of the Seven"" has a few good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's score is as [[rousing]] as ever. Nevertheless, it's a boring film, because it [[simply]] [[fails]] to involve us emotionally.

"I am a huge fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete knock-off of Northern Exposure. There's the city-folk from New York stuck in a remote backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She immediately doesn't hit it off with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The town only has one pilot who is not often available. Ther is only one radio show. And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. I'm [[bored]]. Give me something new to think about.<br /><br />On the upside, the writing is pretty good. [[But]] if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. <br /><br />Perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.",0
"I've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy. Having been born too late to see 'Hair' in its contemporary setting, I have just been familiar with the UK and Broadway cast recordings for many years; and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little creaky but still, great fun.<br /><br />[[The]] [[film]]. It drops some of the songs (The Bed, My Conviction, Frank Mills) and cuts others (Walking in Space). However, what is left is presented very well indeed. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the key performers (especially Treat [[Williams]] as Berger, Beverley [[D'Angelo]] as Sheila, John Savage as Claude) are [[memorable]].<br /><br />As a hippy celebration and anthem, 'Hair' manages to be remain potent even in a [[film]] made ten [[years]] too late.

"The first time [[I]] saw ""Alice in Wonderland  an X-rated [[Musical]] Comedy"", was in the early '80 in a [[Movie-Theater]] in N.Y. [[City]] with some friends. [[I]] remember we actually [[enjoyed]] it very [[much]], although we were left wondering why all the ""goodies"" were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one, [[leaving]] us [[guessing]]...what we just missed. Obviously it was the soft-core [[edited]] ([[chopped]]) [[version]], which [[left]] me with the desire to [[watch]] it again [[soon]], but in its [[original]] [[integral]] [[version]]. Well, more then 20 [[years]] went by, during which I forgot all about this movie and, only a few days ago, by sheer chance, I stumbled upon a heavily used VHS copy (which had seen better times: a [[bit]] washed-out [[colors]], scratchy sound and a few flaws), but guess what? It's the original uncut version and, this time, I really had a ball! Humor, Musical and [[Porn]] may sound an [[awkward]] combination but, in this case, it really [[works]] and, unlikely the big majority of boring porn-flicks nowadays invading our screens, this is a really amusing and entertaining sex [[fantasy]], which will not disappoint you. The direction is clever, the swift editing [[makes]] the movie fly like a bird, all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny, all the actors seem having a good time, the songs are catchy (worth mentioning the one about ""growing up"" sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious ""What's a nice girl like you doing on a Knight like this""), the dance numbers are well choreographed and [[staged]] (amazingly energetic Terry Hall proves that she can ""also"" dance and dances enthusiastically her guts away...[[Don't]] worry, she also does what she was best known for...), the acting, the singing, the set, the costumes are of quality level and then...there is Kristine ""[[Blue]] Eyes"" DeBell, in the first starring role of her career and (oh boy!) she indeed has a few H.C. [[sequences]]! [[Personally]] I think they are absolutely not distasteful, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite arousing. She is young and (ohhh!) so very pretty; with the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality so, she sings, she dances and...what do you expect? She is also [[experimenting]] sex! The closing sequence, when she finally makes love to her boy-friend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie. I think her ""physique du role"" (the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile) and her acting ability, make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable. There is plenty of sex going on in (this) Wonderland and everybody seems eager to ""get busy"" with the first available boy(s) or girl(s), which means lot of hard-core action to be seen. On the other [[hand]], some close-up shots, clearly ""spliced in"", just to make the ""porn-hounds"" really happy, are a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, the sex-action is not [[offensive]] since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music, the dances and the comedy. If you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex, watch it together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of very good time (perhaps also an after-show extra action...) This is ""Adult Entertainment"" so be careful, don't leave this video around or among other kid's videos. If your 10 years old can put his hands on it, he might amuse himself, but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why ""this"" Alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in Lewis Carroll novel or he watched on the Disney's video.

This [[guy's]] physical prowess resembles a more femme Mark Gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to Chris Mitchum as ""Tom Selick."" Powerful. At least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring Asian [[stuntmen]] risking their lives for what is essentially a [[poorly]] [[constructed]] [[movie]] by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. One poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are [[tasteless]] and priceless and quotable dialog such as, ""I would rather trust a rattlesnake!"" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. Movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10",0
"[[I]] [[saw]] this late at night on a [[minor]] [[channel]] and [[I]] put it on expecting a [[laugh]] or [[two]].

One of them gets their tongue stuck on it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying ""COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!"".

"I actually joined this [[site]] simply to write in about this [[movie]]. I was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels. I made it about an hour through before I simply had enough. Curious to see what the general [[movie-opinionated]] public thought of this movie, I looked it up on this site. I was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was [[great]]. I needed to have my say, and here it is: This movie is absolute [[garbage]]. It was a chore to sit through. The ""[[jokes]]"" were uninspired rehashes from other, better shows and movies, and Leguizamo's [[manic]] portrayal of this [[obnoxious]] character should only appeal to age ten and below. That actually may be a stretch even for that age. I'm all for slapstick ridiculousness, but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness. I have an idea, lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed. Now that's [[funny]]. Ha. Ha.<br /><br />Movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality: The Marx Brothers' A Night at the Opera, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut,...and the list goes on. Don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap.<br /><br />By the way, I can only assume that the reason that David Bar Katz (the other writer) did VERY little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted. I'm actually impressed that [[Leguizamo]] was [[able]] to recover after this [[mess]].",0
"The [[subject]] matter was good, direction was OK. [[Mohanlal]] was efficient in his role as a Major. The [[acting]] of the supporting actors was amateurish at best.

"CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children's zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular 'you are there' power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the 'opera house tickets' cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to 'have been to the Sydney Opera House'...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show 'there'. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min 'how George did it' short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a 'you had to have been there' fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.",0
"Eisenstein's [[first]] sound film retells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, eager to bring Russia under Roman Catholicism. Made in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets are obvious stand-ins for the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian town seems a prophetic warning of the massacres of World War II. The film ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a daguerreotype), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. By the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experimentation and made movies that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. That stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he came back with his more accessible film. Nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which features the battle itself, and it is justly seen as a [[milestone]] in movie history: never before (and probably never after) a battle would be so vivid in the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev's [[beautiful]], [[haunting]] [[soundtrack]] (using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time). One of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simpleton Russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful Russian peasant) is really jarring.",1
"I caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

"This [[film]] is [[outstanding]]! On this date of APR, 8 2007 it was on On demand from show time. It had been a while since i seen it, but it does feature Thomas Jane in the first role i seen him in. At first you see a normal guy that seems kind of henpecked, with a wife that seems close to going her own way. The directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed as a cheerleader type, looking very fresh and hot. Trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry, Paulina shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal. Meeting up with his old road pal Nick played by Aaron Eckhart was cool at first, and he even loans him his wife's car to take care of some business. Then he spots nicks silver briefcase, and the day changes for the weird and violent. There is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes. But, Paulina's Dallas steals the show i think. Her telling of a Casey story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a adoption application, is outrageous. As a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy,but as with any rule there are exceptions. Paulina is as one has never seen her before in films. Sexy and lethal, like in the one movie with Tom Selleck, but with a never seen before malevolence. If your looking for film to add to your collection, this one is worth the price. Paulina in the nude is worth the price alone, but this story has everything one might hope one has. Love,friendship,sex and violence in a [[terrific]] mix. When i first seen it years ago it blew my mind, and i know you will feel the same way.",1

"I've been [[strangely]] attracted to this [[film]] since I saw it on Showtime sometime in the early 80's. I say [[strangely]] because it is [[rather]] a ludicrous bit of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not particularly interested in. The dialogue is pompously and nonsensically philosophical (making sense, no doubt, only to it's Franco-Italian producers)and the plot completely extraneous.

"I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book either Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. The well-known vigilante, Paul Kersey tried to visit his friend, Charlie but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because of Charlie didn't pay the protection to the huge and infamous underground gang leaded by Manny Franker. After some altercation during his time in jail, Kersey learned that Franker, who he fought with in jail had his own agenda to make the New York City in the hellfire (and also his influence) by sending his henchmen to set the crime every time, everywhere and everyday. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker who know his profile well and like him very much. [[Kersey]] decided to set the war with Franker and his gang.<br /><br />I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the most straightedge and extreme violence action film which I had seen from the past. This movie used the very straightedge way to tell the story. No ponderous story-telling and less [[unnecessary]] scenes which was the one merit of the movie. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. I believed that many of viewers could like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the crude, [[extreme]] and blast of action for every minutes of the movie, especially the climax scene of the movie and the death of Manny Franker which I thought that it was the maximum action scene.<br /><br />For about the cast, I think everyone was good and get through their role. Charles Bronson made everybody believe that he still be great as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the ""big old cat"", but the great vigilante. Gavan [[O'Herlihy]] also did his job very good. His main villain role in the movie made him look nasty and look like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this movie was pathetic. She didn't look like the main character. I thought that she was appeared only two or three scene before she was killed by Franker and his follower to make a heat on Paul Kersey. She could have more role to appear.<br /><br />For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence made this movie great for extreme action film fans. Fast-paced with back and Forth style made this movie very interested to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had some silly scene and some plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very corny because you attacked your favor guy before you want him to help, it similar to how you punch some guy before you try to borrow him some money. Haha! that's like a joke! Although, I liked the plot twist when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because at first, Shriker looked like the villain very much due to his act to Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was cleared that he had no hidden agenda with Kersey.<br /><br />In another case, the ending scene of the movie set back me. It stumble on everyone's feeling because it ended too easy. Franker's gang members looked unbelievable after they found that Franker was dead, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out from his town before the police caught him. I thought that this style of ending scene could be found in many Cannon Film's movie, but I dislike it.<br /><br />For the summary, I am OK with Death Wish 3 due to my explanation I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even it had some scene I don't like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence could be the best short description of this movie.",1
"I like the good things in life as much as anybody, I suppose, but until about five years ago, opera didn't figure into my entertainment choices. Oh, I made a few attempts to learn what all the fuss was about; I'd watched several television productions -- notably parts of Wagner's Ring Cycle on public television -- hoping to understand other people's fascination with the art form. And I knew I could like parts of various operas (I remember being surprised as a kid that I actually LIKED the [[snippets]] of ""Madame Butterfly"" in ""My Geisha, and I enjoyed the opera scenes in ""Moonstruck"" and ""Pretty Woman""), but unlike the characters in those films, I just didn't ""get it.""<br /><br />[[Then]] in 1995 I saw a live performance of ""Rigoletto"" presented by the New York City Opera Company, and that night I ""got it."" What a [[wonderful]], [[glorious]] [[pageant]] of color and music and raw Emotion! [[And]] I do mean Emotion with a capital E! The key, I think, is that the operatic music allows the [[performers]] to over-act freely and [[believably]] in a way that would seem silly if their words were just spoken. Everything hinges on the music, of course, and when the music is magical, as it is in ""Rigoletto,"" an opera can be a magnificent entertainment.<br /><br />A sympathetic [[family]] member gave me a laserdisc copy of the 1982 TV production of the opera, and I've found that since I can't see live performances of ""Rigoletto"" live on a regular basis, this video version is a [[fine]] substitute. Luciano Pavarotti is perfect in the part of the Duke; Ingvar Wixell is excellent as his mean-spirited court jester Rigoletto; and Rigoletto's beloved daughter Gilda is played by the somewhat plain-featured Edita Gruberova. The sets and costumes are lavish, and the location shots on the river late in the film bring a heightened sense of drama to the [[story]] that could never be matched on a stage.<br /><br />If you've never seen ""Rigoletto,"" or if you think you don't like or understand opera, I urge you to find this one on videotape and buy it or rent it. If you don't like this, if this production of ""Rigoletto"" doesn't make you appreciate the power of the art form of opera, well, just give it up and move on to something else. But I suspect, if you're new to opera as I was, that you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Bill Anderson",1
"Victor Buono as the Devil? Surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made. That's not the worst part of this silly mish-mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it. While the film is by no means terrible it doesn't even approach other 1970's ""haunted house"" flicks like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The Evil can be entertaining in spots, but don't expect to be scared. It's better approached as what it is: a silly horror film made all the sillier by it's over-serious approach.",0

[[Though]] [[I]] felt that the [[directing]] was done well, the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think I got about an [[hour]] into this before I even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. [[You]] catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them, it's just a little too slow. This movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. The only [[thing]] that made it [[bearable]] was the two bottles of wine that I downed during the course of the flick. [[Bring]] on the [[slasher]] films folks, because at least I know what to expect out of them. This was not my thing, too much dark humour, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. I have to say that [[Randy]] Quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and I will give him props for that as I normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.<br /><br />In conclusion I give this horror/comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10.",0
"[[I'm]] a [[dance]] teacher and was [[looking]] [[forward]] to some [[good]] [[dance]] routines in this [[film]]. [[How]] sad to have been [[subjected]] to such a painful experience. <br /><br />I had [[major]] problems with Jennifer Beals and her [[character]]. I found Alex extremely [[repellent]]. Beals' face is so [[young]], sweet and [[innocent]], and this very incongruous with Alex's very [[disturbing]] lewdness, especially in that disgusting [[restaurant]] scene. [[She]] also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. [[It]] is very difficult to believe that Nick [[would]] keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, [[especially]] after she [[opens]] the [[door]] of a moving [[car]] and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. [[And]] what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. In fact, the whole romance was very [[disturbing]] - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. Yuck. <br /><br />[[As]] for the [[dancing]], I'm afraid this 80s [[style]] is totally dated. What on earth was that TV dance sequence about in the club? Who was supposed to be dancing? I wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! And [[even]] that famous final sequence is pretty [[disappointing]], especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. The camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. And what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? And as many other comments have pointed out, she would NEVER get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. Of the 'Flashdancers', I actually thought the best sequence belonged to Cynthia Rhodes (Penny in Dirty Dancing). [[You]] could see that she was a real [[dancer]], and her acrobatics were very impressive. This is of [[course]] if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br /><br />There were [[two]] good bits in this [[film]] - the [[ballet]] [[dancers]] stretching when Alex [[goes]] for the first time to apply for an audition - they [[look]] so [[lovely]] and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. The other good scene was the break dancing in the street. I also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />Some other random points - who was Hanna and how did Alex get to know her? What was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? How did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?Where were her family? Was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? The person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a Disney film needs their head examined. And anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />Many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. Watch ""The Little Mermaid"" instead.",0
"For a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million, this [[little]] movie that could deserves a 'best we could' award.

"[[Put]] [[simply]], this mini-series was terrible. Let me count the [[ways]]. 1. Absurd [[plotting]]. [[2]]. [[Over-acting]]. [[3]]. Scattershot [[approach]] to [[characters]]. [[4]]. [[Annoying]] [[narration]]. [[5]]. [[Inability]] to create viewer [[interest]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />This [[film]] can't even pass the ""Soap [[Opera]] for [[Dummies]]"" [[test]].

[[Imagine]] [[going]] to a [[party]] where they [[show]] you [[dozens]] of [[appetizers]]. [[You]] [[look]] at the wide [[variety]] and [[want]] to [[taste]] them, but suddenly they are [[withdrawn]], and you wonder where they [[went]]. That's [[like]] this [[film]], with [[way]] too [[many]] [[characters]] introduced and [[never]] drawn out. There are enough [[stories]] and [[characters]] in this [[film]] to [[create]] a [[20]] episode series, yet we are [[given]] [[less]] than four [[hours]] to [[digest]] it all.<br /><br />[[There]] are more [[facial]] [[expressions]] and [[reaction]] [[shots]] of [[Ed]] [[Harris]] than you'll [[find]] on 10,000 monkeys. [[The]] pace is [[extraordinarily]] slow. <br /><br />[[Dennis]] Farina and [[Helen]] [[Hunt]] are so [[far]] over-the-top that their [[characters]] are not [[believable]].

"The first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons the movie is so [[bad]]. They constantly reference a movie called ""Get Leo"" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. Every time they do this, you will be really angry. Travolta isn't very cool, neither is Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie though. If you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. If you liked get shorty, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.",0
"I'm not sure why the [[producers]] needed to trade on the name of a somewhat [[successful]] movie franchise because the title [[suggests]] that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most [[talented]] and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the [[HP]] franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally [[different]] film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not [[funny]], and [[could]] not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. [[Although]] Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" [[would]] have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.",0
"This film is so awful it is funny, not quite to [[Troll]] 2 levels of [[hilarity]], but [[funny]] [[nonetheless]]. The [[acting]] is awful, the [[music]] is [[atrocious]] and the story does not [[make]] a blind bit of [[sense]]. The story revolves around a man dressed in an awful granny costume [[killing]] a bunch of people at a party. The death scenes are so [[badly]] [[done]] they are hilarious. [[One]] girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest, but does not scream, try or defend or self or run away. [[She]] also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly. [[Another]] death scene [[involving]] a rope is also extremely hilarious. No thought seems to have been put into the plot. The Granny seems to magically move from one area to another(e.g. be hiding under leaves in a woodland just where the victim just happens to stand, appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier), people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments(would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac) and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous, it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie, you will be disappointed",0
"If someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into 'Ray' and asked what I thought of Jamie Foxx in the title role, it would have been time for a blank stare. After all, what is this (fictitious) person talking' about? That wasn't Jamie Foxx up on the big screen. That was Ray Charles. This is one of the [[best]] performances by anybody in recent years. Like the soundtrack, Jamie as Ray is flat-out [[brilliant]].<br /><br />The blind Genius of Soul (who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with R&B) died during production. The movie about his troubled life is [[good]], not great. Taylor Hackford's direction and James L. White's script follow the well-worn biopic outline. Super-talented youngster battles adversity, achieves greatness while also self-destructing, then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending. The film shows Charles' flaws (heroin abuse, chronic womanizing, persistent bastard-fathering) even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music.<br /><br />Kerry Washington and Regina King play the main women in Ray's life, one his long-suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress. Both actresses match Foxx stride for stride. What takes him to a different level, though, is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician. The entire cast is effective, especially Sharon Warren as his headstrong mother and Curtis Armstrong as a music exec. Hackford's stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and---better yet---more starring roles.<br /><br />I was not a Ray Charles aficionado before 'Ray'. Apparently, the film has left out a lot (as do all biopics), but this picture functions as both an old-fashioned crowd pleaser AND a dark investigation of a brilliant/troubled man. For those who whine that Foxx doesn't actually sing (as if that somehow diminishes his performance), take a hike. No mere actor can sing like Mr. Charles anyway. You can't have everything. What the talented star does in this picture is about as close to ""everything"" as we'll probably see for a while.",1

"The essential [[message]] - one which Miller would have surely intended after seeing Vichy war crimes trials - is that [[hatred]] of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life. Meat Loaf's character, Fred, has known Lawrence for many years, and yet when the time comes, at the bidding of his fanatical supporters, he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their ""target"" group. For me, this is the crucial message - it doesn't matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards - they are marked, and have chance to save themselves by using reason. Animal aggression and anger have blinded [[Fred's]] Union thugs to reality.<br /><br />A friend of mine suggested I should see ""The Wave"" to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it. I once conducted an experiment in a role-playing game, and was shocked to see how normal and level-headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state - which would ultimate threaten them all - because it crept in in stages.<br /><br />Fred is the start, his LA friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into [[violence]] without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong.<br /><[[br]] />[[The]] relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein, the Jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one, because Lawrence misses the point almost until the end: if the bigots force Finkelstein out, where is he to go? If his family have fled the Nazis, what an irony to be tormented again in the land of ""freedom"".<br /><br />That big poster (it's a fairly famous propaganda piece) about American families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail. When you see this film, watch for the grafitti on the subway train, and all the little posters. The message lurks there too.<br /><br />This movie should be on the curriculum of every school, especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by ""reasonable"" people who are just extremists in thin disguises.",1

"Let me say this new [[He-Man]] cartoon is not destroying childhood memories, as I didn't like the old [[He-Man]] cartoon either. I loved the action [[figures]], but I found the cartoon to be [[corny]] and I hated the storyline (the He-Man I liked was the one from the very early, [[pre-cartoon]] mini-comics included in the figure boxes, where He-Man was a Barbarian, the Sword of Power was split in two pieces, and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam-ripoff premise, and no Orko). Anyway, [[let's]] leave the old stuff alone.<br /><br />The new [[He-Man]] cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a [[disgrace]] on its own, s it represents both the [[worst]] [[cheesiness]] of the [[old]] show, and the [[worst]] tendences of [[nowadays]]. [[I]] watched it because I had heard the in-your-face morals of the old show were (thankfully) gone, and this one had more swordplay and character development. But [[I]] encountered an [[awful]] mishmash of the [[worst]] clichés of the genre, characters I couldn't help but hate, and the sadly [[inevitable]] [[Matrix-esque]] visual style.<br /><[[br]] />[[I]] think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters, as it was showing a [[pre-face-peeling]] Skeletor, but that's how far the character development goes, aside from the usual coming-to-age rubbish I see coming in the subsequent episodes, where this teenybopper Adam will be learning the responsibility of his new-acquired powers, blah blah. [[At]] least in the old show Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself [[hating]] his guts. That's what we get when they put out an [[adventure]] show [[aimed]] at pre-teens: pretty [[faces]] and [[wanna-be-cool-and-look-juvenile]] clothes. I should check new episodes to [[see]] if N'Sync [[make]] a special appearance. Man, does this show remind me to the 1996 Flash Gordon [[stinkbomb]] [[cartoon]]!<[[br]] /><br />Dialogue? Ha! It follows absolutely every cliché in the book, from the goody-lil-two-shoes Randor in the opening scene to [[Skeletor's]] immortal ""Oh, and He-Man... I lied!"" in the ending. And Skeletor's voice is still the same high-pitch kind than in the old series. 20 years, and nothing we have learnt.<br /><br />And sure, nowadays there can't exist something remotely action-related that's not Matrix-style. Leave Anime to the Japanese, folks, think fresh ideas. And seeing the characters' poses while fighting didn't help either.<br /><br />Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell comes up with these names?) has no yellow skin now, but grey-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu won't appear in the show either. Shades of the 1996 FG again, where Ming the Merciless was a green, toad-like alien!<br /><br />People are complaining about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I would have liked this more or less if Cringer spoke, he's corny enough this way. And you have your extra ration of cheese with Orko! The shocking thing is, probably many of the people who (rightfully) hated Jar Jar Binks, might be huge Orko fans...<br /><br />I watched the feature-lenght pilot, and I've had enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.",0
"Final Draft - A screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a [[horror]] script. Not a terrible premise, but the execution is awful. This feels like a first year direction and writing job, and probably is. The director jump cuts the hell out of everything. It's meant to be disorienting. What it IS is annoying. So much so that small chunks of film are incoherent. The writing is predictable, and doesn't use follow through on most of the ideas it offers (bag of oranges). It's like they ran out of time and slap-dashed it together for the Toronto Film Festival.<br /><br />This film is not jaw-droppingly ""oh my god it's so bad it's good"" [[bad]]. It's boring [[bad]], and [[irritates]] you for a long time afterward. [[James]] [[Van]] Der Beek is not a terrible actor, and [[keeps]] the [[ship]] [[barely]] above [[water]]. But he's too normal for the kind of psychosis the [[film]] [[tries]] to [[offer]]. He is [[merely]] a [[withdrawn]] guy who one [[day]] [[sees]] [[people]] and hallucinates things, then decides to [[act]] mildly deranged. [[Cause]] [[follows]] [[effect]]. [[Maybe]] [[there's]] [[something]] in the water. [[Now]] [[Darryn]] [[Lucio]], who [[plays]] his ""[[friend]]"", is a [[terrible]] [[actor]].

This film wants to be Jacob's Ladder or The Machinist. It isn't [[even]] Secret [[Window]]. It's the preppy [[girl]] in [[class]] deciding to turn goth.<br /><br />Not irksomely terrible, but the sheer [[stupidity]] of it will ebb at you.

"[[This]], in my [[opinion]], is a very [[poor]] movie that [[advertises]] [[Arnold]] Schwarzenegger as [[starring]] (despite him being the co-star) only to sell more [[copies]]. [[Obviously]] [[taking]] influence from the [[similarly]] [[themed]] [[Conan']] movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually [[fails]] to entertain at all.<br /><br />Bridgette Neilsen stars as Sonja, a [[beautiful]] woman who has been [[given]] unbelievable strength by a [[ghostly]] figure after her village was pillaged, her [[family]] killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of [[Queen]] [[Gedran]] ([[Sandahl]] [[Bergman]]). Gedran is a tyrant Queen who [[wants]] control over the [[barbaric]] world and seeks out a [[talisman]] protected by Sonja's sister to do it. [[After]] discovering what has [[happened]] [[Sonja]] sets out for revenge and at the same time she [[must]] save the world from the wrath of [[Gedran]]. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.<br /><br />The [[first]] [[major]] problem with this movie is the beginning. The [[events]] leading up to the point where [[Sonja]] receives her powers could have [[easily]] made a [[good]] ten to [[fifteen]] minutes of [[enjoyable]] film. However, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a [[quick]] one-minute `Previously on.' segment from a [[television]] [[show]]. Had they [[actually]] made these events part of the story and cut out some of the [[filler]] later on they may have been able to [[start]] redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't ([[I]] wonder why [[director]] [[Richard]] Fleischer has only [[currently]] [[directed]] [[two]] [[movies]] [[since]] Red [[Sonja]]).<[[br]] /><[[br]] />[[This]] [[film]] [[also]] features some of the most [[annoying]] characters in [[history]] [[like]] [[Tarn]] (Ernie [[Reyes]] Jr.) who is a [[stupid]] character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which [[sometimes]] works but in this [[case]] [[fails]] [[miserably]]. He was [[quite]] obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the [[overall]] absurdity of the [[film]] anyway this was [[another]] [[costly]] mistake for [[Red]] Sonja'.<br /><br />For all it's faults there were some [[good]] [[fight]] [[scenes]] involving both Neilsen and Arnie which are worth noting but these are [[nowhere]] enough to save this [[turkey]]. The acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and [[even]] Arnie didn't seem too bothered about his [[performance]]. I don't [[recommend]] this film at all; to me it's a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for Red Sonja'  3/10",0
"[[This]] [[cheapo]] exploitation [[flick]] is some [[genuinely]] [[insipid]] [[stuff]], [[courtesy]] of [[spaghetti]] [[land]] [[director]] [[Lamberto]] [[Bava]], who [[wisely]] left his [[name]] off this [[junk]].<[[br]] /><[[br]] />The [[basic]] crux of this [[outing]] [[concerns]] the [[discovery]] of some brutally [[mutilated]] [[individuals]] being washed-up on [[shore]] in the [[Caribbean]].

"[[I]] [[happened]] [[across]] this [[movie]] while channel-surfing and it [[seemed]] to be [[yet]] another poorly- [[made]] [[Christian]] [[film]] about [[The]] End [[Times]] (which I [[find]] [[rather]] [[entertaining]] because they [[take]] themselves so [[seriously]]). To be [[fair]], [[I]] only [[saw]] the [[last]] 30 [[minutes]], so I [[missed]] the [[part]] about [[UFOs]] and the Sci-Fi stuff. [[But]] it was [[long]] enough for me to [[categorize]] it as an [[embarrassing]] and [[appalling]] [[representation]] of the [[Christian]] [[faith]], as well as a [[rather]] pathetic [[film]] in any [[artistic]] [[sense]].<br /><br />[[As]] a [[film]], the script was [[terrible]], the [[acting]] was [[mediocre]], and the [[pacing]] was poor.

[[Don't]] just [[blame]] it on the [[budget-]] [[films]] can [[still]] be [[interesting]] [[without]] [[special]] [[effects]]. [[This]] wasn't. [[Christian]] [[films]] [[cannot]] [[excuse]] their [[mediocrity]] and [[unoriginality]] in the [[artistic]] [[sphere]] just because of their [[message]]. [[And]] the [[message]] here was [[hardly]] ""[[Christian]].""<[[br]] /><[[br]] />**Disclaimer: The [[rest]] of this [[comment]] is [[targeted]] [[towards]] Christians**<br /><[[br]] />[[First]] off, it is [[unethical]] in any [[business]] to [[bait-and-switch]] your [[customers]]. I don't [[like]] being [[told]] I can [[win]] a [[free]] [[iPod]] only to [[realize]] I have to [[spend]] $300 at participating [[stores]] [[first]]. [[Nonchristians]] don't [[like]] being [[told]] they're watching a Sci-Fi [[film]] and then [[get]] [[bombarded]] with [[Christian]] [[propaganda]] that has all the [[subtlety]] of a [[sledgehammer]]. [[Hidden]] agendas don't [[win]] you any [[friends]], [[much]] [[less]] [[converts]]. <br /><[[br]] />[[Secondly]], you should not [[use]] overt threats to [[convince]] [[people]] your [[beliefs]] are [[true]]. [[The]] [[actors]] who [[represented]] [[Christians]] came off as callous, smug [[bullies]] when [[dealing]] with the skeptical ""[[unbeliever]]""-- they [[even]] go so far as to [[stage]] the [[rapture]] in [[order]] to [[scare]] him into [[believing]]. Representational [[dialogue]]: ""Turn to [[Jesus-]] [[OR]] [[GO]] TO HELL!"" ""[[Fine]], don't [[believe]] [[me-]] BUT [[YOU'LL]] BE SORRY!"" ""[[The]] [[day]] you [[die]], I can [[guarantee]] you'll [[wish]] you paid more [[attention]] to this Jesus [[stuff-]] [[WHEN]] [[YOU]] [[LAND]] IN [[THE]] [[BELLY]] [[OF]] [[HELL]]!"" OK, [[I]] may be [[exaggerating]], but it [[certainly]] [[came]] off in the same manner. If you think this is a ""clear message for Christ,"" you're wrong. I don't recall Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. So Christians, please don't use this as a ""witnessing tool"" for your ""unsaved"" friends. It is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message.<br /><br />Thirdly, the theology was bad. Apart from characterizing Jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, it offered one pat answer: ""UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens,"" which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most Christians. As the Bible doesn't mention UFOs or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. The rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. If you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of Christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in Church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. The majority of orthodox Christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.<br /><br />Basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I wouldn't recommend it.",0
