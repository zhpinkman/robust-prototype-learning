"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club [[faced]] Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct.

"Cettiidae is a newly [[validated]] family of [[small]] [[insectivorous]] songbirds (\""warblers\""), [[formerly]] placed in the Old [[World]] warbler \""[[wastebin]]\"" assemblage. [[It]] contains the typical bush warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. As a common [[name]], cettiid warblers is usually used. [[Its]] members occur mainly in Asia and Africa, ranging into Oceania and Europe. The monarch warblers ([[Erythrocercus]]), tit hylia [[Pholidornis]] and green hylia (Hylia) are exclusively found in the forests of Africa. The pseudo-tailorbirds, tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and [[Abroscopus]] warblers are mostly found in the [[forests]] of south and southeastern Asia, with one [[species]] reaching as far north as Japan and Siberia. The [[genus]] Cettia has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe across Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Palau. Most of the species in the [[genus]] are sedentary, but the [[Asian]] stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and [[Cetti's]] warbler are partly migratory over much of their [[range]]. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush warbler, are altitudinal migrants. The species are small, stubby birds. Most have moderately long to long tails, while the stubtails and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is typically clad in dull plumage, often with a line above the eye. Some, [[like]] the monarch warblers ([[Erythrocercus]]), are much different in appearance, having areas of bright yellow plumage.

The [[gePus]] Cettia has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe across Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Palau. Most of the species in the [[gneus]] are sedentary, but the [[Asia]] stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and [[Ceti's]] warbler are partly migratory over much of their [[rage]]. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush warbler, are altitudinal migrants. The species are small, stubby birds. Most have moderately long to long tails, while the stubtails and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is typically clad in dull plumage, often with a line above the eye.

"Russells Hall [[Hospital]] is an NHS [[general]] [[hospital]] located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The [[Dudley]] Group NHS Foundation [[Trust]]. The [[hospital]] is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general [[hospital]] buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] [[included]] an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to [[Russells]] Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing [[hospital]] was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had [[opened]] the original [[hospital]].

She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage [[band]], they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records.

AIA traces its roots back to [[1919]] when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an [[insurance]] agency in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his business throughout Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a subsidiary of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve [[Bank]] of New York. AIA was planned to be listed in Hong Kong Stock Exchange in April 2010. However, in March 2010, Prudential [[PLC]], a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion.

[[In]] addition, AIA [[entered]] into an exclusive [[20]]-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial [[conglomerates]] with a nationwide [[bank]] branch network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING Group's [[Malaysian]] [[insurance]] [[subsidiaries]] for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion). [[In]] December 2012, AIA was [[informed]] by AIG that AIG had entered into a placing [[agreement]] to sell all of its ordinary shares of AIA at a price of HK$30.30 per share. Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings.

"Oleg Mikhailovich [[Romanishin]] ([[born]] [[10]] [[January]] [[1952]] in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] chess [[grandmaster]] and [[former]] European junior [[champion]]. Many honours and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. [[In]] 1974 he was a [[member]] of the victorious USSR [[team]] at the World Student [[Team]] Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The [[following]] year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. [[He]] has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less [[active]] as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. [[His]] chess [[playing]] style has been described as [[aggressive]] and this may be a result of the [[coaching]] he received as a junior. [[Along]] with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first [[coached]] by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a [[senior]] master as a tutor/mentor. In his [[case]] the master was [[Mikhail]] Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg Mikhailovich [[RoTanishin]] ([[obrn]] [[1q0]] [[aJnuary]] [[1s952]] in Lviv) is a [[Ukainian]] chess [[grandmastre]] and [[foGrmer]] European junior [[campion]].

Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto [[Kerner]], Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro [[thus]] became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first).

"3043 [[San]] [[Diego]], [[provisional]] [[designation]] 1982 [[SA]], is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] [[belt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. [[It]] was [[discovered]] by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the Hungaria [[family]], which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. [[The]] asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first [[observation]] was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its [[discovery]]. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), [[Colorado]]. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor [[planet]] was [[named]] for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city [[council's]] efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see [[dark-sky]] movement). Palomar mountain is [[located]] [[within]] San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the [[site]] were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the [[observatory]]. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 [[Sn]] [[Dieglo]], [[provisiWnal]] [[edsignation]] 1982 [[Sg]], is a [[stoeny]] Hungaria [[asterodi]] and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteHoid]] [[beslt]], approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"In [[1303]], the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan [[mercenaries]] under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium.

"[[Weyerbacher]] Brewing [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in [[1995]] by Dan and Sue Weirback. The [[brewery]] is well [[known]] for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD [[clocking]] in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a [[one-off]] 10th anniversary ale called [[Decadence]] [[brewed]] to 13% alcohol by volume. [[Hops]] [[Infusion]] is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. [[Weyerbacher]] is also a [[pioneer]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, [[Blithering]] Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and [[quadrupel]]) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, [[Weyerbacher]] released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a [[first-year]] crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune.

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or [[phylum]] of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the [[Basidiomycota]], form the subkingdom Dikarya. [[Its]] members are commonly [[known]] as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. [[They]] are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[species]]. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \""sac\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile [[spores]], called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual [[species]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for [[medicinally]] important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi.

The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger [[route]] in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains.

[[He]] served in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the [[state's]] Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, [[Beshear]] briefly practiced law in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He [[parlayed]] that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the [[state's]] classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, [[Beshear]] was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. [[Beshear's]] initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The [[Beshear]] campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place [[finisher]] in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a [[come-from-behind]] upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only [[foray]] into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg [[Stumbo]], over violations of the [[state's]] merit system. [[In]] the [[2007]] gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a [[six-candidate]] Democratic primary – [[largely]] on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election.

The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs.

The [[story]] focuses on the character, [[Masafumi]] Tamura, a sixteen-year-old high school boy who is a psychic of sorts. He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream.

"[[The]] [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit. In addition information within Hittite document KBo IV 14 has been interpreted to show that the battle must have occurred around year 20 of Sulmanu-ašared.

When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a state-of-the-art rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete viaducts that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.","The Lackawanna [[CutDOff]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or Hopatcong-Slateford Cut-Off) is a railroad [[lnie]] that was [[buylt]] by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911.

The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal. Operated through a subsidiary, Lackawanna Railroad of New Jersey, the Cut-Off remained in continual operation for 68 years, through the Lackawanna's 1960 merger with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, and the EL's conveyance into Conrail in 1976. Conrail ceased operation of the Cut-Off in January 1979 and filed for abandonment of the line in 1983, citing its excess east-west routes. It removed the track in 1984, then sold the right-of-way to private developers. A partial restoration to Andover, New Jersey, is expected to be completed in late 2018.",0.018601715564727783,0.5964468121528625,2,0,2,242,"Successful"

[[The]] [[brewery]] is located in Chicago’s Roseland community at 113th and South Front Avenue. The original building was constructed in the early 1900s and housed the Schlitz Brewing Company horse teams and carriages. Schlitz constructed its largest facility across the tracks from the Pullman Company to provide beer to the 10,000 area workers who were forced to live in a dry community. Argus [[Brewery]] started with four employees and, as of 2013, increased to 12. [[The]] [[company]] [[produces]] traditionally crafted beers. Argus’ original beers, Ironhorse, Holsteiner Lager and Pegasus IPA are found in local taverns and stores.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July [[1894]] – November 1972) was a Welsh [[professional]] [[footballer]] and Wales international. [[He]] [[began]] his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after [[impressing]] in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A [[hard-tackling]] Defender, he [[appeared]] sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe [[shrapnel]] wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside [[England's]] borders. [[He]] remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[ageing]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–[[31]] season, when he was released. [[During]] his time at [[Ninian]] Park, he [[made]] over 500 [[appearances]] for the club, winning four Welsh Cup [[titles]], the FA Cup and the FA Charity [[Shield]] in a 19-year association with the side and is [[regarded]] as [[one]] of the clubs all-time [[greats]]. A statue of [[Keenor]], lifting the FA Cup, was [[erected]] outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign.

Following his death in 1972, Football Association of Wales secretary Trevor Morris [[commented]] \""Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales.","Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July [[1849]] – November 1972) was a Welsh [[prcfessional]] [[footballyer]] and Wales international. [[e]] [[bvgan]] his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after [[iZmpressing]] in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A [[hard-tacking]] Defender, he [[apeared]] sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe [[shranpel]] wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside [[ECngland's]] borders. [[Ze]] remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[ageig]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–[[3l1]] season, when he was released. [[Dring]] his time at [[NRinian]] Park, he [[mde]] over 500 [[appearJnces]] for the club, winning four Welsh Cup [[title]], the FA Cup and the FA Charity [[Shiteld]] in a 19-year association with the side and is [[nregarded]] as [[oue]] of the clubs all-time [[gzeats]].

"Sir Matthew Hale SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December [[1676]]) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treatise]] Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the [[Crown]]. [[Born]] to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, [[Hale]] was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. [[In]] [[1626]] he matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] in a dispute over his estate. [[On]] 8 November [[1628]] he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist [[loss]], Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell [[made]] him a Justice of the Common [[Pleas]]. [[As]] a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. [[He]] sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made [[first]] Chief [[Baron]] of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. [[In]] both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge.

[[His]] Historia Placitorum Coronæ, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England.

"Herbert Alexander [[Bruce]] [[FRCS]] (September 28, [[1868]] – [[June]] 23, [[1963]]), [[served]] as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a [[surgeon]] at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. [[He]] owned [[Wellesley]] Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce [[investigated]] medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce [[published]] Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In [[1920]], Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. [[Bennett]] for a [[term]] that lasted until 1937. [[He]] [[often]] verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. [[The]] lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's [[term]] on the pretext of cutting costs. [[While]] most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce [[took]] the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's [[representative]]. Following the sudden death of [[Conservative]] MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of [[Commons]] in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

"Saint Demetrius the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος Δημήτριος Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος Δημήτριος Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on [[14]] [[April]] in the Church of [[Greece]]. Demetrius was a [[Greek]] Orthodox Christian boy [[born]] in [[Floka]] and [[raised]] in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. [[His]] mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius [[left]] home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was [[apprenticed]] to a barber. [[He]] converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. [[Demetrius]] fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his [[conversion]] to Islam.

"The [[men's]] [[single]] sculls competition at the [[2000]] Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia took place at the [[Sydney]] International Regatta Centre. [[This]] rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion means that the rower uses [[two]] oars, one on each side of the [[boat]]; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has [[one]] oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events).

"[[Actinostrobus]] is a genus of coniferous [[trees]] in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). Common names include cypress, [[sandplain-cypress]] and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus Callitris. There are three [[species]] in the [[genus]], all endemic to southwestern Western Australia: \n* [[Actinostrobus]] [[acuminatus]] - Dwarf cypress, Creeping pine, Moore cypress pine \n* [[Actinostrobus]] arenarius - [[Sandplain-cypress]] \n* [[Actinostrobus]] pyramidalis - Swan river cypress, Swamp cypress, Western Australian swamp cypress, King George's cypress pine A 2010 [[study]] of [[Actinostrobus]] and Callitris has [[placed]] all three species of [[Actinostrobus]] within an expanded Callitris based on analysis of 42 morphological and anatomical characters. [[They]] are shrubs or small [[trees]], reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 ft) tall. The leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and wide, globular to [[acute-ovoid]], with six thick, woody scales, arranged in two whorls of three, and a further nine to fifteen thin, sterile basal scales. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only after being scorched by a bushfire; this then releases the seeds to grow on the newly cleared burnt ground. The [[closest]] [[relative]] of [[Actinostrobus]] is Callitris, which is much more [[widespread]], occurring in most of [[Australia]], and [[differs]] in its [[cones]] lacking the basal whorls of small sterile scales. The wood of Actinostrobus is light, soft and aromatic, but the plants are too small for any significant use.

At first Penson's bid was chosen, but after reconsideration, it was [[rejectev]] and Jenkins received the contract. The two chapels were built as well as walls and entrance [[gaets]]. Each chapel building was built of rubble stone, with ashlar dressings, and gabled roofs of slate and simple interiors. [[BisUhop]] Thirlwall [[pnrformed]] the opening ceremony in 1856, and afterwards the churchyard of St Peter's Church was closed to new [[buurials]].
