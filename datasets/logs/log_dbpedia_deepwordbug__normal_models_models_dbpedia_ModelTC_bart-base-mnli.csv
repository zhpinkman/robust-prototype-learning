"Augustus George Hazard (April 28, 1802 – [[May]] 7, [[1868]]), [[known]] as [[Colonel]] [[Augustus]] [[Hazard]], was an [[American]] [[manufacturer]] of [[gunpowder]] and the [[namesake]] of Hazardville, [[Connecticut]]. [[Hazard]] was [[born]] in Kingston, [[Rhode]] [[Island]] on [[April]] 28, 1802, a son of Thomas and Silence Knowles Hazard. [[His]] family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. [[As]] a young man, he worked as a [[merchant]] in Savannah, Georgia. In [[1827]] he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission [[agent]] engaged in the sale of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the outset of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was supplying the Union Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a day. The mill at Hazardville was in operation 24 hours a day and produced 40% of all the gunpowder used during the Civil War by the Union. Hazard [[lived]] on Enfield Street in Enfield, several miles from the powder mill, and [[ran]] the business until his death on May 7, 1868, at the Ascot House in New York City.","Augustus George Hazard (April 28, 1802 – [[Mqay]] 7, [[8168]]), [[knoHwn]] as [[CIlonel]] [[AugusZus]] [[OHazard]], was an [[Ameriacn]] [[manufacture]] of [[gupnowder]] and the [[namesak]] of Hazardville, [[Connectiuct]].

[[AC]] gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been [[preicted]] in early opinion [[polsl]], the [[P]] had been widely [[expeGcted]] to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. [[Te]] Asturian [[Boc]] (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente Álvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture [[vating]] of Álvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration. The resulting government, however, was not able to gather legislative support to approve its 2012 regional budget, with both PP and PSOE blocking the vote, resulting in a fresh [[eelction]] being held in March 2012.",0.0008436441421508789,0.039978861808776855,5,5,5,475,"Failed"

[[It]] was [[first]] planned in the 1960s as a [[general]] [[hospital]] for Dudley and the surrounding area. [[The]] first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in [[1976]] as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the [[general]] [[hospital]] buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest [[Hospital]] in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in [[Stourbridge]]. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual [[carriageway]] in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in 1999.

"[[Cettiidae]] is a newly validated [[family]] of [[small]] [[insectivorous]] [[songbirds]] (\""warblers\""), [[formerly]] [[placed]] in the Old World warbler \""wastebin\"" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. As a common [[name]], cettiid warblers is [[usually]] used. Its members occur mainly in Asia and Africa, ranging into Oceania and Europe. The monarch warblers ([[Erythrocercus]]), tit hylia Pholidornis and green hylia ([[Hylia]]) are exclusively found in the [[forests]] of Africa. The [[pseudo-tailorbirds]], tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and Abroscopus warblers are mostly found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia, with one species reaching as far [[north]] as Japan and Siberia. The genus [[Cettia]] has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe across Asia to the Pacific [[islands]] of Fiji and Palau. Most of the [[species]] in the genus are sedentary, but the [[Asian]] stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and Cetti's warbler are partly migratory over much of their range. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush warbler, are altitudinal migrants. [[The]] [[species]] are small, stubby birds.

He spent the next thirteen seasons playing for San Francisco, where he was featured in the \""Million Dollar Backfield\"", made three straight Pro Bowl appearances, and in [[1954]] was named the NFL MVP by United Press International ([[UPI]]).

Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities [[company]], announced that it [[would]] buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development Bank (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year bancassurance agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide bank branch network.

"Patoka [[Lake]] is the second-largest reservoir in the U.S. state of Indiana (after Lake Monroe) and is spread across Dubois, Crawford, and Orange counties in southern Indiana. Created as a joint effort between the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the lake is one of eight such reservoirs built in the state to [[provide]] a secure [[water]] supply and as a [[method]] of flood control. [[The]] [[lake]] [[covers]] 8,[[800]] surface acres ([[36]] [[km²]]) of water in the summer. [[The]] [[lake]] was [[created]] by damming the Patoka River about 118.3 miles (190 [[km]]) above its mouth with the [[Patoka]] Lake [[Dam]], a 145-feet-high rockfill earthen [[dam]]. The [[lake]] is fed by [[several]] smaller tributaries including Allen Creek, Paint Creek, and Ritter Creek. After the lake was created several parks and nature preserves were established around it totaling 16,920 acres (68.5 [[km2]]). The lake and dam is still managed by a cooperative management team of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Patoka Lake is a great place for photography, as it is inhabited by migrating birds, a large variety of fish and beautiful lake shores. The lake has been heavily stocked with bass, bluegill, [[catfish]], redear, crappie, and walleye. Once a year the Lake Association hosts GarDaze, an event bringing in avid fisherman from around the world, including fishing celebrities like Babe Winkleman and Bill Dance.

During the 1948–49 BAA season, Smawley ranked sixth in the league in total points and fourth in field goals made. After his playing career ended, Smawley served as a school principal and basketball coach. Between 1951 and 1956, Smawley served as the Athletic Director and head men's basketball coach at Pembroke State College, known today as The University of North Carolina at Pembroke, in Pembroke, North Carolina. In December [[1951]], he took a three-month leave of absence from Pembroke State College to play with the Baltimore Bullets.

Following the [[war]], he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one [[term]], leaving office in [[1953]]. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, [[Hagan]] [[challenged]] incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the actual popular vote (34,318 to 33,629), but under [[Georgia's]] election laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a month after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. Hagan would serve six terms from the 87th United States Congress to the 92nd United States Congress. He ran unopposed in 1962, and faced minor Independent opposition in 1964, winning with 72%.

In the general election, he faced his first Republican opponent, Porter Carswell (1904-?) of Burke County, who held Hagan to a 58-42% margin. In 1968, he would face desultory opposition in the primary and defeated Savannah Republican State Senator and former Georgia Republican Party chairman Joe Tribble (1920–2003) by a 68-32% margin.

"Oleg Mikhailovich [[Romanishin]] (born 10 January 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainian]] [[chess]] grandmaster and [[former]] European [[junior]] champion. Many [[honours]] and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. [[After]] winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in [[Teesside]], England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following [[year]], he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after [[Tigran]] Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), [[Jurmala]] 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and [[Debrecen]] 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his [[3rd]]= finish at Sochi in 1982. [[Nowadays]] less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster [[circuit]], such as [[Solin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. [[His]] chess [[playing]] style has been described as aggressive and this [[may]] be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail [[Tal]], an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess [[opening]] [[theory]], he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point.

Many [[hoonurs]] and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. [[fAter]] winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in [[eesside]], England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following [[yaer]], he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after [[iTgran]] Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), [[Jurmal]] 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and [[ebrecen]] 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his [[3dr]]= finish at Sochi in 1982. [[Nowdays]] less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster [[circuti]], such as [[Oolin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. [[Hi]] chess [[paying]] style has been described as aggressive and this [[my]] be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail [[aTl]], an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess [[Ipening]] [[thgeory]], he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point.

[[Andrew]] Silver [[took]] his first [[rides]] in 1983 at [[father]] Len's Rye House circuit, making rapid progress from reserve to heat leader in [[three]] years. When Len, decided to sell his interest in the [[Rockets]], son Andrew was widely expected to make the move into top flight British League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena Essex Hammers for a reported £9,000. Andrew, the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the club, setting numerous records wherever he rode. [[He]] was capped by England at senior level, qualified for successive British Finals and [[set]] numerous track records wherever he rode. [[He]] has a [[Hammers]] career average of 10.52. Silver [[also]] [[enjoyed]] considerable individual success during his tenure with the Hammers, winning the prestigious end-of-season National League Riders' Championship in 1987 at Coventry to add to the Grand Slam title he won earlier that year at Oxford. In 1988 Andrew moved into top flight racing, signing for British League Swindon. [[His]] career stuttered from this point on and - despite four seasons in Robins' colours - failed to live up to expectations. [[He]] [[moved]] to Eastbourne in 1992 - and was joined by his father in 1993 - before calling it a day at the start of the 1994 season.

[[He]] [[retired]] from speedway early to take up a post in his father's ski holiday company. After a long break from the sport, Silver made a successful comeback as a member of the 2009 Rye House Rockets team in the Premier League and scored a six-ride maximum for the Rockets in their victory over Stoke on 2 [[September]] 2009.

When Len, decided to sell his interest in the [[RockXets]], son Andrew was widely expected to make the move into top flight British League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena Essex Hammers for a reported £9,000. Andrew, the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the club, setting numerous records wherever he rode. [[Je]] was capped by England at senior level, qualified for successive British Finals and [[est]] numerous track records wherever he rode. [[Hb]] has a [[Hammer]] career average of 10.52. Silver [[als]] [[enjoyUed]] considerable individual success during his tenure with the Hammers, winning the prestigious end-of-season National League Riders' Championship in 1987 at Coventry to add to the Grand Slam title he won earlier that year at Oxford. In 1988 Andrew moved into top flight racing, signing for British League Swindon. [[Hsi]] career stuttered from this point on and - despite four seasons in Robins' colours - failed to live up to expectations. [[eH]] [[movzed]] to Eastbourne in 1992 - and was joined by his father in 1993 - before calling it a day at the start of the 1994 season. Despite reported attempts to lure him out of the saddle - Andrew caused a sensation by almost winning an individual meeting at Arena Essex during a one-off appearance in 1997 - Silver's leathers remained on the hook. [[Fe]] [[retiremd]] from speedway early to take up a post in his father's ski holiday company. After a long break from the sport, Silver made a successful comeback as a member of the 2009 Rye House Rockets team in the Premier League and scored a six-ride maximum for the Rockets in their victory over Stoke on 2 [[Beptember]] 2009. At the end of the 2009 season, Silver retired once again.",0.0006072521209716797,0.0007797479629516602,0,0,0,450,"Failed"

The most appreciable changes in their [[oriits]] occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the [[mofons]] approach to within about 1,400 [[kilormetres]] (870 [[im]]). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low [[denstiy]] and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy [[boyd]].

It was [[discovered]] by American female astronomer Eleanor [[Helin]] on 30 [[September]] 1982, at the U.S. Palomar [[Observatory]] in California. [[The]] bright E-type [[asteroid]] is a [[member]] of the [[Hungaria]] family, which form the [[innermost]] dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. [[The]] asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was [[obtained]] from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously [[published]] period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the [[survey]] carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in [[diameter]] and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

"[[Anthelm]] of Belley (1107–1178) was a [[prior]] of the [[Carthusian]] Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. [[He]] was [[born]] near Chambéry in 1107. [[He]] would [[later]] receive an [[ecclesiastical]] benefice in the area of Belley. When he was [[thirty]] years [[old]], he resigned from this [[position]] to [[become]] a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. [[He]] was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. [[He]] also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm continued in his office almost constantly for twenty-four years, barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and helped defend the sitting Pope Alexander III against the antipope Victor IV. Alexander III appointed Anthelm bishop of Belley in 1163. In that [[position]], he is said to have been fearless and uncompromising, working to reform the clergy and regulate the affairs of the diocese. One example of his [[fearlessness]] occurred in 1175, when [[Anthelm]] excommunicated [[Count]] Humbert of Maurienne for having taken [[one]] [[priest]] [[captive]] and [[murdering]] another priest who had [[tried]] to [[free]] him. Humbert appealed his excommunication to Pope Alexander [[III]], who reversed Humbert's excommunication. Anthelm, who believed that Humbert was not penitent for his misconduct, withdrew from his diocese in protest. Pope Alexander then [[commissioned]] [[Anthelm]] to travel to England to try to reconcile [[Henry]] II of England and Thomas Becket. Anthelm's health was such that he was unable to take the journey. Anthelm returned to Belley to help care for the poor and the lepers of the area. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.

Gooden was then unopposed for his second term in the general election held on November 6, 2012. However, on March 4, 2014, Dr. Spitzer, in a second bid for the office, unseated Gooden in the Republican primary. Spitzer polled 8,421 votes (51 percent) to Gooden's 8,079 (49 percent). Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, made a campaign stop for Gooden's behalf in Forney in Kaufman County, a month before the primary election.

In 2010, Gooden had no Democratic opponent in his heavily Republican district. Gooden won renomination to a second term in the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012. [[H]] polled 6,385 votes (53.5 percent) to 5,545 (46.5 percent) for his opponent, Stuart Spitzer, a surgeon from Kaufman, who was born and reared in Athens in Henderson County. Gooden was then unopposed for his second term in the general election held on November 6, 2012. However, on March 4, 2014, Dr. Spitzer, in a second bid for the office, unseated Gooden in the Republican primary. Spitzer polled 8,421 votes (51 percent) to Gooden's 8,079 (49 percent). Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, made a campaign stop for Gooden's behalf in Forney in Kaufman County, a month before the primary election. Accompanying Straus to Forney was State Senator Bob Deuell,who lost his own seat in the subsequent May 27 runoff election to the Tea Party movement choice, Bob Hall. In 2016, however, Gooden staged a successful comeback and defeated Spitzer in the March 1 Republican primary, 14,500 votes (51.8 percent) to 13,502 (48.2 percent). He returns to the state House in January 2017. On October 1, 2016, Gooden will wed Alexa Calligas, formerly of Shreveport, Louisiana, whom he met in Austin. She is the daughter of journalist George Calligas and his wife, Tina.",0.0005698800086975098,0.0007777214050292969,0,0,0,369,"Failed"

"Martin Bruce Cameron (born 24 August 1936), Australian politician, was a [[member]] of the Australian [[Senate]] and the South Australian [[Legislative]] [[Council]]. [[In]] [[1968]] [[Cameron]] [[contested]] the safe Labor [[House]] of Assembly seat of Millicent for the Liberal and Country League ([[LCL]]) after [[objecting]] to the views of incumbent Des Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered a [[by-election]]. Corcoran comfortably won the [[by-election]]. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron [[entered]] South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party.

However the Liberal Movement was vastly [[outpolled]] by the LCL (renamed the Liberal Party of Australia in [[1974]]), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification.

Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. [[The]] [[ridge]] [[lies]] in Lady [[Evelyn-Smoothwater]] Provincial Park. Due to its remote location, [[Ishpatina]] Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the south out of the town of [[Capreol]] north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a [[winter-time]] approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the ridge was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane.

The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually Müller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers.

[[After]] graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, [[Beshear]] [[briefly]] [[practiced]] [[law]] in New [[York]] before [[returning]] to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he [[gained]] a reputation as a [[consumer]] advocate. [[He]] parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under [[Governor]] [[John]] Y.

Graham. He also clashed with first [[lady]] Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion.

For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"[[The]] slaty-backed gull ([[Larus]] schistisagus) is a large [[white-headed]] gull that [[breeds]] on the [[western]] coast of [[Alaska]] but [[travels]] widely during [[nonbreeding]] [[seasons]].

"[[The]] naval Battle of the Solent [[took]] [[place]] on 18 and 19 [[July]] 1545 during the Italian Wars, fought between the fleets of Francis I of [[France]] and Henry VIII of England, in the Solent channel off the south [[coast]] of England between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The engagement was inconclusive and is most notable for the [[sinking]] of the English carrack Mary Rose. In 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. [[Against]] this armada — [[larger]] than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. [[The]] French [[expedition]] started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast. The French invasion force which had landed at the Isle of Wight were defeated, and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the [[Battle]] of Bonchurch. On [[18]] July 1545 the English came out of Portsmouth and engaged the French at long range, little damage being done on either side. [[La]] Maitresse was on the point of sinking [[due]] to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering. On the [[night]] of [[18]] [[July]] Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. [[The]] next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary Rose, the flagship of [[Vice]] Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but [[35]]–40 of her crew. [[The]] exact reasons for the [[sinking]] are not known, but it was [[believed]] at the [[time]] that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after firing at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the French fleet believed that the galleys had sunk her, though this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains.

The Pride and its associated events are organized by the [[APNOGLBT]], [[AsBociação]] da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e [[TransAxuais]], since its foundation in 1999. The march is the event's [[min]] activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities as well as to the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade. The meeting point is at the Museum of Art of São Paulo (MASP – Museu de Arte de São Paulo) right at the middle of São Paulo's postcard Avenida Paulista. Even though the meeting time is at 12 noon, the parade doesn't start to move before 2 or 3 PM. [[Th]] parade is 2.6 miles [[lng]] (4.2 km) and starts at Avenida Paulista (MASP), at around noon. It follows Rua da Consolação to the end at Praça Roosevelt, in Downtown São Paulo, at around 10 [[MP]]. Strongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, the event counts with a solid security plan. These are last year's numbers: approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. [[Te]] [[SPo]] Paulo [[ay]] Pride Parade is heavily [[supoprted]] by the federal government as well as by the Governor of [[SXo]] Paulo and the City Major. [[any]] politicians [[sho]] up to open the main [[vent]] and the government often parades with a [[floFat]] with [[politiians]] on top of it. Caixa Econômica Federal, a government bank and Petrobrás, Brazil's oil firm, have already reaffirmed their commitment to backup the event and its diversity, funding once again the event.In the Pride the city usually receives about 400,000 tourists and moves between R$ 180 million and R$ 190 million.",0.0007679462432861328,0.0008168816566467285,5,5,5,483,"Failed"

When it opened on December 24, 1911, the Cut-Off was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania.

"Frederick Charles '[[Fred']] Keenor (31 July [[1894]] – [[November]] [[1972]]) was a Welsh [[professional]] footballer and [[Wales]] international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former [[schoolteacher]]. A [[hard-tackling]] Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the [[war]] as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, [[Keenor]] returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0.

[[He]] remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at [[Ninian]] Park, he [[made]] over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup [[titles]], the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats.

Following his death in 1972, Football Association of Wales secretary Trevor Morris commented \""Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales.","Frederick Charles '[[IFred']] Keenor (31 July [[189e4]] – [[Novkember]] [[1927]]) was a Welsh [[professoinal]] footballer and [[Wles]] international. He began his career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former [[schoNlteacher]]. A [[hard-tacklig]] Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the [[wa]] as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, [[Keenro]] returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0.

"Sir Matthew Hale SL (1 November 1609 – 25 [[December]] 1676) was an [[influential]] [[English]] [[barrister]], judge and [[lawyer]] most noted for his treatise [[Historia]] Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the [[Pleas]] of the [[Crown]]. [[Born]] to a [[barrister]] and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, [[Hale]] was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In [[1626]] he [[matriculated]] at Magdalen Hall, Oxford (now Hertford College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a [[barrister]], [[Hale]] [[represented]] a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale [[Commission]], which investigated law reform. Following the [[Commission's]] dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. [[As]] a [[judge]], Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. [[He]] sat in [[Parliament]], either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia Placitorum Coronæ, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","Sir Matthew Hale SL (1 November 1609 – 25 [[DIecember]] 1676) was an [[influentiaAl]] [[Englsh]] [[barriXster]], judge and [[alwyer]] most noted for his treatise [[Histori]] Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the [[Plesa]] of the [[Crmwn]].

Born in Blackstock, Ontario [[near]] [[Port]] Perry, [[Bruce]] was [[educated]] as a [[surgeon]] at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a [[member]] of the Royal [[College]] of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was [[appointed]] [[inspector-general]] of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and [[attained]] the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. [[Bruce's]] report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was [[appointed]] Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. [[He]] often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

In 1916, during World War I, he was [[appoijted]] [[inspector-genera]] of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and [[attaied]] the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his appointment was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. [[Bruce']] report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was [[xappointed]] Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. [[Hc]] often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.",0.0005819797515869141,0.0009731054306030273,0,0,0,427,"Failed"

"Saint [[Demetrius]] the Neomartyr (Greek: Άγιος [[Δημήτριος]] Νεομάρτυρας, or Άγιος [[Δημήτριος]] Ο Νέος) is an Orthodox Christian saint, commemorated on 14 April in the [[Church]] of Greece. Demetrius was a [[Greek]] [[Orthodox]] [[Christian]] boy [[born]] in [[Floka]] and [[raised]] in [[Ligouditsa]], both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the [[time]], the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. [[His]] mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius [[left]] home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a barber. [[He]] converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and [[became]] an Orthodox [[monk]] on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he [[must]] perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was [[recanting]] his conversion to Islam. [[His]] [[abbot]] tried to [[dissuade]] him, to no [[avail]], and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times.

"[[Actinostrobus]] is a genus of coniferous [[trees]] in the Cupressaceae (cypress family). Common names include cypress, sandplain-cypress and cypress-pine, the last of these shared by the closely related genus Callitris. There are three species in the genus, all endemic to southwestern Western Australia: \[[n*]] Actinostrobus acuminatus - Dwarf cypress, [[Creeping]] pine, Moore [[cypress]] pine \[[n*]] Actinostrobus arenarius - Sandplain-cypress \[[n*]] Actinostrobus pyramidalis - Swan river cypress, Swamp cypress, Western Australian swamp cypress, King George's [[cypress]] pine A 2010 study of Actinostrobus and Callitris has placed all three species of [[Actinostrobus]] within an expanded Callitris based on analysis of 42 [[morphological]] and anatomical [[characters]]. They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–[[26]].2 ft) [[tall]]. The leaves are evergreen, of two [[forms]]; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–[[20]] mm (0.[[39]]–0.[[79]] in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.[[12]]–0.[[24]] in) long, and are [[located]] at the tips of the twigs. [[The]] female [[cones]] start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10–20 mm (0.[[39]]–0.79 in) long and wide, globular to acute-ovoid, with six thick, woody scales, arranged in two whorls of [[three]], and a further nine to fifteen thin, sterile basal scales. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only after being [[scorched]] by a bushfire; this then releases the seeds to grow on the newly cleared burnt ground. The closest relative of Actinostrobus is Callitris, which is much more widespread, occurring in most of Australia, and differs in its cones lacking the basal whorls of small sterile scales. The wood of Actinostrobus is light, soft and aromatic, but the plants are too small for any significant use. They are occasionally planted as ornamental shrubs, but their use is restricted by the high risks imposed by their very high flammability in bushfires.","[[Actinotsrobus]] is a genus of coniferous [[Lrees]] in the Cupressaceae (cypress family).

He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"".

[[Achong]] [[played]] in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England.

After his last Test match, he continued to [[play]] cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

"The Scottish Review of Books is a quarterly literary magazine [[published]] in Scotland. [[It]] was established in October 2004 with the support of the Scottish [[Arts]] [[Council]]. In 2009 it became a [[limited]] company with a board of directors, [[Scottish]] [[Review]] of Books Limited. [[It]] has [[published]] articles by [[many]] distinguished contributors and commentators. [[The]] Review has been [[highly]] successful since its launch and now has a [[circulation]] of [[around]] [[320]],000 [[copies]] per year. [[The]] [[magazine]] is [[inserted]] free of charge in The Herald newspaper and is also available by subscription in print or online and in schools, museums, libraries, book festivals and bookshops across Scotland. The tie-in with The Herald has been of considerable benefit in improving its reach; Carla Sassi of the University of Verona comments that \""the Scottish Review of Books... probably reaches a larger reading public than any specialised literary journal or magazine did in the past.\"" According to the editor, Alan Taylor, \""our aim ... is to get people talking about issues surrounding Scottish literature and to challenge people’s perceptions about particular subjects. At a time when Edinburgh has been recognised by UNESCO as the first World City of Literature and when Scotland’s writers are receiving both critical and popular acclaim, a magazine such as this is a timely and much needed addition to the literature landscape in Scotland.\"" It was established to provide a smaller-scale Scottish equivalent of the London Review of Books, on which it is closely modelled in name and appearance. Unlike the LRB, which covers world literature, the SRB deals only with Scottish books.

The tie-in with The Herald has been of considerable benefit in improving its reach; Carla Sassi of the University of Verona comments that \""the Scottish Review of Books... probably reaches a larger reading public than any specialised literary journal or magazine did in the past.\"" According to the editor, Alan Taylor, \""our aim ... is to get people talking about issues surrounding Scottish literature and to challenge people’s perceptions about particular subjects. At a time when Edinburgh has been recognised by UNESCO as the first World City of Literature and when Scotland’s writers are receiving both critical and popular acclaim, a magazine such as this is a timely and much needed addition to the literature landscape in Scotland.\"" It was established to provide a smaller-scale Scottish equivalent of the London Review of Books, on which it is closely modelled in name and appearance.

"[[Luna]] [[14]] ([[E-6LS]] series) was an [[unmanned]] space mission of the Luna program run by the Soviet [[Union]]. [[It]] was also called Lunik 14. The [[spacecraft]] is believed to have been similar to Luna 12 and the instrumentation was similar to that carried by Luna 10. It provided data for studies of the interaction of the earth and lunar masses, the lunar gravitational field, the propagation and stability of radio communications to the [[spacecraft]] at different orbital positions, solar charged particles and cosmic rays, and the motion of the Moon. This flight was the final flight of the second generation of the Luna series. [[Luna]] [[14]] successfully [[entered]] lunar [[orbit]] at [[19]]:[[25]] UT on 10 April 1968.

When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874 Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry. Kerferd's Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced free trader, and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by Charles [[Gavan]] Duffy's liberal [[government]], and replacing the lost revenue with a land tax and a tax on beer and spirits. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August 1875. Kerferd was again Attorney-General in later conservative governments (1875–1877, 1880 and 1883–[[86]], in the Service government). In [[1883]] Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the federal convention. In [[1886]] he quit politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The appointment was not without controversy as several barristers had served longer in the legal profession, but Kerferd did have eight years as attorney-general.

"[[Athanasios]] John Traicos (born [[17]] May 1947) is a [[former]] cricketer who [[represented]] [[South]] Africa and Zimbabwe at international level. [[He]] was primarily an off spin bowler, and is [[one]] of a small number of cricketers to have played at the highest [[level]] for more than [[one]] country. Traicos was born in Zagazig, [[Egypt]] in 1947 where his father Tryphon worked in the family business. [[He]] is of [[Greek]] descent, his [[father]] having been born in Lemnos, Greece and his maternal grandmother in Kalymnos, [[also]] in Greece. In [[September]] 1948 the family moved to what was then [[Fort]] Victoria in Southern Rhodesia. [[As]] a child he was [[known]] as \""Naso\"", a contraction of his name \""Athanasios\"", but when he started university he [[adopted]] the name \""John\"". Traicos [[grew]] up in Rhodesia and played for that country, which at the time was regarded as a \""province\"" within the South African domestic cricket setup. While a student at the University of Natal he benefited from being coached by Trevor Goddard making his first-class debut on 24 June 1967 when he represented South African Universities against Cambridge University, taking 5–54 in the first innings. [[He]] represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. [[He]] [[made]] his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali Bacher. He took four catches and three wickets in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international cricket because of apartheid. Traicos continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 ICC Trophy tournaments. He also played for Zimbabwe in the 1983 Cricket World Cup, and was an important part of the side which inflicted a shock defeat on Australia.

[[At]] [[567]] [[metres]] (1,[[860]] [[ft]]) [[high]], it is the [[tallest]] dam in the world, either natural or man-made. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The [[dam]] [[rises]] to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by [[Usoi]] Dam now holds Sarez Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.074 cubic kilometres (13,031,000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the [[dam]], which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water seeps out of the base of the [[dam]] at a rate which approximately matches the rate of inflow, maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 megawatts. Geologists are concerned that the Usoi [[Dam]] may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would unleash a locally catastrophic flood. The Murghab's river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep.

Virginia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in its inaugural year in the conference, running off a streak of eight straight wins to end the regular season after a 2–2 start. Tech finished 10th in the final Associated Press poll with a 10–3 record. The team's head coach was Frank Beamer, who was named ACC Coach of the Year. Virginia Tech began the season unranked nationally, having suffered a meltdown at the end of the 2003 season. The Hokies faced a daunting schedule, beginning with a nationally-televisioned game against the defending national [[co-champion]] USC [[Trojans]]. That game, known as the BCA Classic, was the first NCAA college football game of the year, and would be followed by a tough conference schedule. Tech lost to eventual BCS National Champion USC at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, [[24-13]], losing the lead late in the third quarter. After a 63-0 shellacking of Western Michigan, Tech played its first ever ACC game on September 18, against Duke. Tech prevailed 41-17 in Lane Stadium. The Hokies dropped to 2-2 following a 17-16 home loss to N.C. State, in which the Hokies missed a would-be winning field goal as time expired. The team then needed to win five of its next eight games to extend its 11-season streak of playing in a post-season bowl game. After reeling off three-straight wins, including a 19-13 squeaker over then #7 West Virginia, the Hokies' fortunes looked bleak in the fourth quarter of their game against Georgia Tech in Atlanta on ESPN Thursday night college football. Tech was down 14-0 at one point and trailed 20-12 with 5:28 left in the fourth quarter. Tech racked up 22 unanswered points to exterminate the Yellow Jackets. Tech would go on to win their remaining regular-season games, including a 24-10 win over then #16 Virginia in Lane Stadium and a 16-10 away victory over then #9 Miami, to clinch the ACC Championship. As ACC Champions, Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2005 Sugar Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game in New Orleans, Louisiana. Virginia Tech faced Auburn, a team that had gone undefeated in the regular season but was denied a bid to the national championship game by virtue of its lower rank in the BCS poll. In a game that was not decided until the final two minutes, Virginia Tech lost to Auburn 16-13. Tech was led by quarterback Bryan Randall during the season.

"Álvaro [[Obregón]] [[Salido]] (Spanish [[pronunciation]]: [[[ˈalβaɾo]] [[oβɾeˈɣon]]]; February [[19]], [[1880]] – July [[17]], [[1928]]) was a [[general]] in the [[Mexican]] Revolution, who [[became]] [[President]] of Mexico from 1920 to 1924. [[He]] supported Sonora's decision to follow Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza as [[leader]] of a revolution against the Huerta regime. Carranza [[appointed]] Obregón [[commander]] of the [[revolutionary]] forces in northwestern Mexico and in 1915 appointed him as his minister of war. In 1920, Obregón launched a revolt against Carranza, in which Carranza was assassinated; he won the subsequent election with overwhelming support. Obregón's presidency was the first stable presidency since the Revolution began in 1910. [[He]] oversaw massive educational reform (with Mexican muralism flourishing), moderate land reform, and labor laws sponsored by the increasingly powerful Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers. In August 1923, he signed the Bucareli Treaty that clarified the rights of the Mexican government and U.S. oil interests and brought U.S. diplomatic recognition to his government. In 1923–24, Obregón's finance minister, Adolfo de la Huerta, launched a rebellion in part protesting the Bucareli Treaty; Obregón returned to the battlefield to crush the rebellion. [[In]] his victory, he was aided by the United States with arms and 17 U.S. planes that bombed de la Huerta's supporters.

"[[Faxinalipterus]] is a genus of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic [[Caturrita]] Formation of southern Brazil. The type [[species]], Faxinalipterus minima was named and described in 2010 by José Fernando [[Bonaparte]], Marina Bento Soares and César Leandro Schultz. The generic [[name]] is derived from [[Faxinal]] do Soturno and a [[Latinised]] Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific [[name]], from Latin minimus, means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of [[Faxinal]] do Soturno, Rio Grande do [[Sul]], from the [[Caturrita]] Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian, 220–215 million years old. The holotype, UFRGS [[PV0927T]], is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. [[Faxinalipterus]] is a rather small [[animal]], with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind [[limbs]], much better conserved than the front [[limbs]], are relatively long. From the [[maxilla]] it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The [[maxillary]] teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are [[elongated]] and recurved. The describers have assigned Faxinalipterus to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust [[humerus]], suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the [[Caturrita]] Formation consists of terrestrial sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a terrestrial, not coastal, habitat. They also concluded Faxinalipterus is the most basal known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the scapula. However, Alexander Kellner has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"".

"Drive-Thru Records, established in 1996, was a [[California-based]] [[record]] [[label]] [[owned]] by siblings Richard and Stefanie Reines. The [[label]] was partially responsible for popularizing the pop-punk/emo sound of the early to mid-2000s. After [[facing]] financial obstacles in getting their bands' music into [[stores]], Drive-Thru entered into a distribution deal with MCA/Universal. MCA was dissolved and changed into Geffen Records.
