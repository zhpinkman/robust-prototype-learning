"[[On]] 20 [[October]] 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the [[game]] was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989.

"[[The]] [[Raid]] on Griessie was a British attack on the Dutch port of [[Griessie]] (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. The raid was the final [[action]] in a series of engagements [[fought]] by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the [[destruction]] of the Dutch squadron with the [[scuttling]] of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Sir]] Edward [[Pellew]]—[[sought]] to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which [[ran]] through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates [[reconnoitred]] Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia [[raid]] however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they [[took]] shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December [[1807]], a second [[raiding]] squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour [[surrender]]. The Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message.

Campbell was married to [[Maud]] Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, 1870. They had four children. He was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat. After serving as a prosecutor in [[Butler]] County, Ohio from 1876–1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States [[House]] of Representatives twice from Ohio's 7th congressional district (Forty-eighth and [[Fiftieth]] Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once held by his uncle [[Lewis]] D. Campbell, serving from 1884-1889. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the [[House]] Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic.

[[It]] was first planned in the 1960s as a general [[hospital]] for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the [[hospital]] opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new [[hospital]] included an [[accident]] and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest [[Hospital]] in Dudley and the Corbett [[Hospital]] in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be [[downsized]] to [[out-patient]] services only, with [[Russells]] Hall being expanded to include all of the [[borough's]] [[in-patient]] services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size.

"[[The]] Ten [[Days]] of [[Brescia]] (Italian: [[Dieci]] [[giornate]] [[di]] Brescia) was a revolt which [[broke]] out in the northern Italian city of that name, which [[lasted]] from [[March]] [[23]] to [[April]] 1, 1849. In the early 19th century Brescia was part of the Austrian puppet state called Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The revolt, headed by the patriot Tito Speri, began on the same day as the Battle of Novara (though news of [[Austria's]] victory there had not yet reached [[Brescia]]). [[The]] [[Austrian]] troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily [[cannonaded]] the [[city]], damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the [[revolt]], when reinforcements arrived. The following day General Haynau, later nicknamed \""The Hyena of Brescia\"", came and demanded the unconditioned surrender of the Bresciani. As the latter refused, the [[fighting]] continued until late night, when the heads of the revolt decided to [[surrender]].

The revolt, headed by the patriot Tito Speri, began on the same day as the Battle of Novara (though news of [[Austrias']] victory there had not yet reached [[BrescMia]]). [[he]] [[Autsrian]] troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily [[canonaded]] the [[cYty]], damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the [[ervolt]], when reinforcements arrived.

He went on to make 301 [[league]] and [[cup]] appearances for the Hammers before joining Leyton Orient as player-coach in December 1962. He became chairman of the Professional Footballers' [[Association]] in 1962 and remained in the post until his retirement as a player in 1966. He left Orient in 1965 to coach Charlton [[Athletic]] under Bob Stokoe, from where he moved to [[Aston]] Villa in 1967. In late 1968, he joined Leicester City as assistant manager under former [[West]] Ham team-mate Frank O'Farrell, taking them back to the top flight when they won the Division 2 Championship in 1970–71. When O'Farrell moved to [[Manchester]] United in June 1971, Musgrove followed, again taking an assistant manager's position. O'Farrell and Musgrove were both sacked by Manchester United in December 1972, after a disastrous 5-0 loss at Crystal [[Palace]]. In January 1973, Musgrove took the manager's job at Torquay United, a post that O'Farrell had held himself five years earlier. He had little success at Torquay, with a highest league finish of 9th place in 1975–76 in his time at Plainmoor. He left Torquay in November 1976, to be replaced by O'Farrell, and the following year coached NASL side Connecticut Bicentennials.

Musgrove played for his local side, Lynemouth Colliery, before being called up for [[nationla]] service, which he served in the [[Roymal]] [[Ari]] [[ForcG]]. He played for a Forces team and also for Scottish junior side Sunnybank while in the RAF and joined [[Wet]] Ham United in December 1953. [[t]] West Ham, he soon [[estqblished]] himself as a left-winger, making his [[laegue]] debut in 1954 against Brentford. He went on to make 301 [[lague]] and [[up]] appearances for the Hammers before joining Leyton Orient as player-coach in December 1962. He became chairman of the Professional Footballers' [[Asociation]] in 1962 and remained in the post until his retirement as a player in 1966. He left Orient in 1965 to coach Charlton [[Ahletic]] under Bob Stokoe, from where he moved to [[Astotn]] Villa in 1967. In late 1968, he joined Leicester City as assistant manager under former [[Wet]] Ham team-mate Frank O'Farrell, taking them back to the top flight when they won the Division 2 Championship in 1970–71. When O'Farrell moved to [[MancheJster]] United in June 1971, Musgrove followed, again taking an assistant manager's position. O'Farrell and Musgrove were both sacked by Manchester United in December 1972, after a disastrous 5-0 loss at Crystal [[Palae]]. In January 1973, Musgrove took the manager's job at Torquay United, a post that O'Farrell had held himself five years earlier. He had little success at Torquay, with a highest league finish of 9th place in 1975–76 in his time at Plainmoor. He left Torquay in November 1976, to be replaced by O'Farrell, and the following year coached NASL side Connecticut Bicentennials. In 1978, he coached another NASL side, Chicago Sting and on his return to England sold [[insuranOe]] for a while before joining [[Exeer]] City as coach/physio.

"William Harold Lee (December 9, 1884 – February 3, 1971) was an American 20th century movie theater [[designer]] and later the chief [[architect]] for Eastern College. He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey. In 1920, Lee was commissioned for the renovation of the Walnut Street Theatre at 9th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. The Walnut, a National Historic Landmark, is the oldest theater in the United States in continuous operation. The Royal Theatre at 1524 South Street in Philadelphia, was designed in two phases. Architect Frank E. Hahn designed the exterior in 1920, and Lee contributed the design of the interior in 1925. The two designs represent divergent styles of architecture, with Lee's French-inspired Art Deco interior at odds with Hahn's exterior. Lee frequently used the Art Deco style to modernize theaters designed in more traditional styles. Lee designed the Pennypack Theatre in Art Deco style, located on the 8000 block of Frankford Avenue of Holmesburg. In 1928, Lee designed the Sedgwick Theatre, 7133-41 Germantown Avenue in Philadelphia.

He was a protégé of acclaimed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Lee attended Trinity College for a year, before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania where he studied architecture. During his career, Lee designed numerous theaters and several buildings at Temple University, Franklin and Marshall College. Many of his theaters have only recently begun to receive critical recognition, and while some of his greatest theaters have been demolished, such as the Astor Theater in Reading, Pennsylvania and Victoria Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania. In most cases those which still exist today are being restored. These include the Anthony Wayne in Wayne, Pennsylvania, the Majestic Theatre in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the Bryn Mawr Theatre in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the Hiway Theatre in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the Lansdowne Theatre in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, and the Landis Theater in Vineland, New Jersey.

The [[lkae]] and dam is still managed by a cooperative [[maKagement]] team of the [[Arm]] [[Cops]] of Engineers and the [[Inidana]] [[DXepartment]] of Natural Resources. Patoka Lake is a great place for photography, as it is inhabited by migrating birds, a large variety of [[fis]] and beautiful lake shores. The lake has been heavily stocked with bass, bluegill, catfish, redear, crappie, and [[wallyee]]. Once a year the Lake Association hosts [[GaraDze]], an event bringing in avid fisherman from around the world, including fishing celebrities like Babe Winkleman and Bill Dance. Other facilities include an archery range, boat ramps, a cross-country skiing course, fishing areas (including ice fishing), a disc golf course, trails for hiking and bicycling, hunting areas, interpretive and recreational programs, star parties, picnic shelters, swimming areas, and waterskiing zones. The lake also hosts a large campground with over 500 camping sites. Patoka Lake has been very beneficial to the surrounding community and the [[Sttae]] of [[Indaina]]. The lake has generated over $19.4 million in revenue and visitor expenditures in 2005 and has so far prevented over $88 million in flood damage. In [[2h006]] the lake saw 648,738 visitors who provide jobs for 197 local residents.",0.0034133195877075195,0.003736436367034912,2,2,2,368,"Failed"

Hagan served in numerous other state [[government]] positions and also [[worked]] in the insurance and financial planning [[industry]] and several agricultural pursuits. He [[served]] on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly prevailed in the [[actual]] [[popular]] vote ([[34]],318 to 33,629), but under Georgia's [[election]] laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of 26 to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the general election (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the time and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a month after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. Hagan would serve six terms from the 87th [[United]] States Congress to the 92nd United States Congress.

"AIA [[Group]] [[Limited]] [[known]] as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest [[independent]] public [[listed]] pan-Asian life insurance group. It has a [[presence]] in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% [[subsidiary]] in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an [[insurance]] [[agency]] in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his [[business]] [[throughout]] Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a [[subsidiary]] of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve [[Bank]] of New York. AIA was planned to be [[listed]] in Hong Kong [[Stock]] Exchange in April [[2010]]. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development [[Bank]] (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year [[bancassurance]] agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide [[bank]] [[branch]] network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING [[Group]]'s Malaysian insurance [[subsidiaries]] for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion).

Upon completion of the placing, AIG fully divested its previous 13.69% AIA share holdings. On 15 August 2013, AIA had become English Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur's Cup Shirt sponsor for the 2013-2014 season. In December 2013, AIA and Citibank reached an agreement on a landmark exclusive bancassurance partnership that encompasses 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The markets included in the agreement are: Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Korea. In February 2014, the insurer announced that it entered into a five-year major partnership with Tottenham Hotspur. Under the agreement, the AIA brand will feature on the shirts of Spurs players in all competitions until the end of the 2018-2019 season. In June 2014, AIA Singapore was named \""Best Employer to Work For in Asia\"" and received the award from HR Asia.","AIA [[roup]] [[Limitde]] [[kdown]] as AIA (Chinese: 友邦保險控股有限公司) is the largest [[indepeHndent]] public [[lsited]] pan-Asian life insurance group. It has a [[preseece]] in 18 markets in Asia-Pacific, wholly owned branches and subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, Macau, Brunei, a 97% [[subGsidiary]] in Sri Lanka, a 26% joint venture in India, and representative offices in Myanmar and Cambodia. AIA traces its roots back to 1919 when an enterprising young man named Cornelius Vander Starr opened an [[insuArance]] [[agencFy]] in Shanghai, China. Vander Starr eventually expanded his [[eusiness]] [[htroughout]] Asia, the US, and worldwide. In 1945, he relocated his head office from Shanghai to New York after a forced exit from mainland China. Thus the Asian AIA became a [[subsiiary]] of New York-based American International Group (AIG). In 2009 AIA split from AIG after it was finalized that AIA, as well as ALICO (another AIG subsidiary), were placed under the administration of a special purpose vehicle in exchange for the Federal Reserve [[Blank]] of New York. AIA was planned to be [[listde]] in Hong Kong [[Sock]] Exchange in April [[2001]]. However, in March 2010, Prudential PLC, a UK-based financial services and securities company, announced that it would buy AIA for US$35.5 billion. The purchase later fell through, and AIA held an IPO in October 2010, raising approximately HK$159.08 billion (US$20.51 billion), the world's third largest IPO ever. In September 2012, AIA agreed to acquire a 92.3% stake in Sri Lankan insurer Aviva NDB Insurance from British insurer Aviva and Sri Lanka's National Development [[Ban]] (NDB). In addition, AIA entered into an exclusive 20-year [[bancassurnce]] agreement with NDB, one of Sri Lanka's largest financial conglomerates with a nationwide [[badnk]] [[branhc]] network. In October 2012, AIA announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire ING [[GrouAp]]'s Malaysian insurance [[usbsidiaries]] for a cash consideration of €1.336 billion (US$1.73 billion).

In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999.

Many honours and awards were bestowed on him as a young man. After winning the European Junior Championship in [[1973]], he became an International [[Master]] the same year. In 1974 he was a member of the victorious USSR [[team]] at the World Student Team Championship held in [[Teesside]], England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after [[Tigran]] [[Petrosian]]. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, [[Reggio]] Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen [[1990]]. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive [[victory]], finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his [[career]], as was his 3rd= finish at [[Sochi]] in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as [[Solin-Split]] 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver.

In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","[[sleg]] [[MiWkhailovich]] [[Romanihsin]] ([[orn]] [[g0]] [[Jaunary]] [[192]] in [[Lvv]]) is a [[Ukrainina]] chess [[grandmaser]] and former European junior champion.

"[[3070]] Aitken, provisional designation 1949 [[GK]], is a stony Flora [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter.

[[It]] [[orbits]] the [[Sun]] at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). [[Its]] [[orbit]] has an [[eccentricity]] of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the [[plane]] of the ecliptic. The used first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the [[asteroid]] was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational [[light-curve]] of this asteroid was obtained from photometric [[observations]] made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010.

Andrew Silver took his first rides in 1983 at father Len's [[Rye]] House circuit, making rapid progress from [[reserve]] to heat leader in three years. When Len, [[decided]] to sell his interest in the Rockets, son Andrew was widely expected to make the move into top flight British League racing - so it was a shock when he moved across to the Arena Essex Hammers for a reported £9,000. [[Andrew]], the hottest property in British Speedway at this time, was an instant sensation during his two years with the [[club]], setting numerous records wherever he rode. He was capped by [[England]] at senior level, qualified for successive British Finals and set numerous track records wherever he rode. He has a Hammers career average of 10.52. [[Silver]] also enjoyed considerable individual success during his [[tenure]] with the [[Hammers]], winning the prestigious end-of-season National League Riders' Championship in 1987 at Coventry to add to the Grand Slam title he won earlier that year at Oxford. In 1988 Andrew moved into top flight racing, [[signing]] for British [[League]] Swindon.

"Cornelius W. Wiebe, CM ([[February]] [[18]], [[1893]] – July [[12]], 1999) was a [[Canadian]] physician and [[politician]]. Wiebe was [[born]] to a Mennonite family in Altona, Manitoba.

Over the course of 53 years, he delivered over 6,000 babies. A member of the Liberal Party, he was elected to the Legislative [[Assembly]] of [[Manitoba]] in the 1932 provincial election, defeating Conservative incumbent [[Hugh]] McGavin by [[447]] votes in the Morden and Rhineland constituency.

Chinese paddlefish are also [[commoanly]] referred to as \""Chinese swordfish\"", or \""elephant fish\"". Paddlefish [[pspulations]] have declined dramatically throughout their historic [[raneg]] as a result of overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral [[spawnig]] [[grJounds]].

"Lago [[di]] Piediluco is a [[lake]] that straddles the [[border]] between the Province of Terni, Umbria, Italy and the Province of Rieti, Lazio.

The [[league]] [[played]] its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the [[league's]] inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous [[night's]] CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in [[Latrobe]], Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between [[Lynda]] Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game.

The [[Dos]] played in the first two of the [[PBL's]] three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an [[lBA]] championship in 1971. The [[laegue]] [[playeH]] its first game on December 9, 1978, between the hometown Does and the Chicago Hustle at the Milwaukee Arena, with the [[cleague's]] inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous [[ninht's]] CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in [[Larobe]], Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between [[LLynda]] Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss. Joanne Smith scored the league's first basket on a perimeter jump shot and an assist from Brenda Dennis, with the game ball presumably earning a place of honor in the Smithsonian Institution, as surmised by the Chicago Tribune. Milwaukee had trailed for most of the game, behind 13 points one minute into the fourth quarter, but defensive pressure by the Does led to a series of turnovers and Milwaukee tied the score at 81 with 5:28 left in the game. The Hustle's offense heated up in the last few minutes and held on for a 92–87 win in the league's first game. Kathy [[DeoBer]] and Joanne Smith led the Does with 22 points each, though Debra Waddy-Rossow of the Hustle lead all scorers with 30 points. The team was rather unsuccessful on the court during its two seasons in the [[legaue]].

Currently, the Red Line is the only one in operation, the first of several light rail lines planned in Jerusalem. Construction on the Red line began in 2002 and ended in 2010, when the testing phase began. It was built by the CityPass consortium, which has a 30-year concession to operate it.

"The Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (HB&WRJR&DCo.) was opened on 20 July 1885. It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885. The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an eight-mile branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway). Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER). Following incorporation into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), duplicated infrastructure was closed or reduced in function – notably Cannon Street station and the Springhead Locomotive Works.

However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a [[sexual]] cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. [[Previously]] placed in the Deuteromycota along with asexual [[species]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on morphological or physiological similarities to [[ascus-bearing]] taxa, and by phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. The ascomycetes are a monophyletic group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for [[medicinally]] important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as [[pathogens]] of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic ascomycetes, including apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews. Several [[species]] of ascomycetes are biological model organisms in laboratory research. Most famously, Neurospora crassa, several [[species]] of yeasts, and Aspergillus [[species]] are used in many genetics and cell biology studies. Penicillium species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial infectious diseases are examples of taxa that belong to the Ascomycota.","Ascomycota is a division or [[hpylum]] of the [[Zkingdom]] Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. [[tIs]] members are [[yommonly]] [[konwn]] as the sac fungi or [[ascomytetes]]. They are the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[speceis]]. The defining feature of this fungal group is the \""[[asucs]]\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός ([[askso]]), meaning \""sac\"" or \""[[winesin]]\""), a microscopic [[sexpal]] structure in which nonmotile spores, called [[ascospoces]], are formed. However, some [[Pspecies]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a [[sxeual]] cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores.

Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The [[ridge]] lies in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park. Due to its remote location, [[Ishpatina]] [[Ridge]] is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km north. There are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular [[approach]] route to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a [[logging]] [[road]] to the south out of the town of [[Capreol]] north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/[[snowshoe]]. Historically, a fire tower atop the [[ridge]] was staffed by forest workers and they would have been [[ferried]] to the site by float plane.

In June 2003 Equity Broadcasting ended the [[ease]] with Alltel Arena and announced that it would attempt to sell the team. In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others. Additionally, with the December 8, 2008, filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy by Equity Media Holdings Corporation, this has become unlikely. In July 2009, Alltel Arena officially became Verizon Arena after Verizon Wireless, Inc. purchased Alltel Corp.",0.002232789993286133,0.008128166198730469,0,0,0,434,"Failed"

"Steven Lynn \""Steve\"" Beshear ([[born]] [[September]] [[21]], [[1944]]) is an American [[attorney]] and Democratic Party politician who was the 61st Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015. He served in the Kentucky House of [[Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the state's Attorney General from 1980 to 1983, and was the 49th Lieutenant Governor from 1983 to 1987. After graduating from the [[University]] of [[Kentucky]] College of [[Law]] in [[1968]], Beshear briefly [[practiced]] [[law]] in New [[York]] before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as [[attorney]] general, serving under Governor [[John]] Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the [[state's]] classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme [[Court's]] decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis [[George]] Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated [[governor's]] mansion. In 1983, Beshear was [[elected]] lieutenant governor in the administration of [[Governor]] Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a [[come-from-behind]] upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington [[law]] firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican [[Governor]] Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.","Steven Lynn \""Steve\"" Beshear ([[bron]] [[Semtember]] [[C21]], [[i944]]) is an American [[attorneNy]] and Democratic Party politician who was the 61st Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015.

As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa. Seiwa in turn follows Tamura around, wondering why the other boy seems to dislike him for no apparent reason and demanding an explanation.

Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi [[Allstars]].

"The naval Battle of the Solent took [[place]] on [[18]] and 19 July 1545 during the Italian [[Wars]], [[fought]] between the [[fleets]] of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, in the Solent channel off the south coast of England between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The engagement was [[inconclusive]] and is most notable for the [[sinking]] of the English carrack [[Mary]] Rose. [[In]] 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental [[fire]] at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his [[flag]] to La [[Maistresse]] which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel. The French entered the Solent and landed troops on the Isle of Wight and the Sussex coast. The French invasion [[force]] which had landed at the Isle of Wight were [[defeated]], and forced to retreat, by a local militia in the Battle of Bonchurch.

The engagement was [[inconclusihve]] and is most notable for the [[snking]] of the English carrack [[aMry]] Rose. [[nI]] 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental [[ifre]] at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his [[fGag]] to La [[Maimstresse]] which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel.

"The Lackawanna [[Cut-Off]] (also known as the New Jersey Cut-Off or [[Hopatcong-Slateford]] [[Cut-Off]]) is a railroad [[line]] that was built by the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (DL&W) between 1908 and 1911. [[When]] it opened on December 24, 1911, the [[Cut-Off]] was considered a \""super-railroad\"", a [[state-of-the-art]] rail [[line]], built upon large cuts and fills, and which included two large concrete [[viaducts]] that allowed for what was considered high-speed travel at that time. The [[line]] was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between [[Hoboken]], New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The [[Cut-Off]] ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) [[west-northwest]] of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The [[Cut-Off]] was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old [[Road]], the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more. The Cut-Off also had no railroad crossings at the time of its construction. All 73 structures on the line were constructed of reinforced concrete, which was considered a pioneering use of the material.  The construction of the roadbed required the movement of millions of tons of fill material using techniques similar to those used on the Panama Canal.

"[[Dolomedes]] /dɒləˈmiːdiːz/ is a [[genus]] of large spiders of the [[family]] Pisauridae. They are also [[known]] as [[fishing]] spiders, raft spiders, dock spiders or wharf spiders. Almost all Dolomedes [[species]] are semi-aquatic, with the exception of the tree-dwelling D. albineus of the [[southwestern]] [[United]] [[States]]. Many [[species]] have a striking [[pale]] stripe down each side of the body. They hunt by waiting at the edge of a pool or [[stream]], then when they detect the ripples from prey, they run across the surface to subdue it using their foremost legs, which are tipped with small claws; like other spiders they then inject venom with their hollow jaws to kill and digest the prey.

Six-spotted spiders can also walk on water to get their prey. [[Dolomedes]] is [[derived]] from the Greek [[word]] \""dolomed\"" which [[means]] wily, deceitful.

It was [[erected]] as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail [[bridges]] built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo [[line]] commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the [[bridge]] designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the [[bridge]] was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer [[Isambard]] Kingdom [[Brunel]]. The foundation [[stone]] was laid by Mr. W. S. [[Urquhart]] Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from [[Footscray]] to Sandhurst (now [[Bendigo]]), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,[[937]].2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways. William Edward Bryson was described as a Civil Engineer in 1857 when he was a member of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria. He was also a member of the Royal Society of Victoria 1859-60 and employed at the \""Government Railway Office\"". He published \""Resources of Victoria & their development\"" in [[1860]] in the Royal Society’s Transactions.

"Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 [[July]] [[1894]] – November [[1972]]) was a Welsh [[professional]] [[footballer]] and Wales [[international]]. He began his career at his hometown [[club]] [[Cardiff]] City after [[impressing]] in a trial match in [[1912]] that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared [[sporadically]] for the team in the Southern [[Football]] [[League]] before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) [[Battalion]], [[Middlesex]] Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning promotion to the First Division one season after joining the Football League in 1920 and helping the club to an FA Cup final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. To date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an [[ageing]] squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at [[Ninian]] Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, winning four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time [[greats]]. A statue of [[Keenor]], lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new stadium, the Cardiff City Stadium, in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign. Keenor finished his [[career]] with spells at [[Crewe]] Alexandra, Oswestry Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 [[caps]] for the Wales national [[football]] team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three occasions in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and [[captained]] the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals.

"Herbert Alexander Bruce FRCS (September 28, [[1868]] – June 23, 1963), served as the 15th [[Lieutenant]] [[Governor]] of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in [[Blackstock]], Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was [[educated]] as a [[surgeon]] at the [[University]] of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of [[Surgeons]]. [[He]] [[owned]] Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a [[professor]] of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed [[inspector-general]] of the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]] by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical [[practices]] in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical [[Service]] which urged a complete reorganization of the medical [[corps]]. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his [[appointment]] was protested by Sir William Osler as an [[affront]] to the medical [[profession]]. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published [[Politics]] and the Canadian Army Medical [[Corps]], criticizing the government for its actions but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as surgical consultant to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including greater reliance on [[nurse-anesthetists]] and operating room technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the [[vice-regal]] office in the face of the Great Depression. The [[lieutenant-governor's]] official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.","Herbert Alexander Bruce FRCS (September 28, [[18t68]] – June 23, 1963), served as the 15th [[LiePutenant]] [[Goevrnor]] of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937.

"Sir Matthew Hale SL (1 November [[1609]] – 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[Placitorum]] Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown. [[Born]] to a barrister and his wife, who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his father's relative, a strict Puritan, and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen [[Hall]], Oxford (now [[Hertford]] College), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister [[like]] his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant-at-Law in a dispute over his estate. On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln's [[Inn]], where he was called to the [[Bar]] on 17 [[May]] 1636. [[As]] a barrister, Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War, including Thomas Wentworth and William [[Laud]]; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles used. Despite the Royalist loss, Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions, and under the Commonwealth of England he was [[made]] Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. [[As]] a judge, [[Hale]] was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. [[He]] [[sat]] in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of [[Breda]] was the [[Member]] of Parliament who [[moved]] to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, [[Hale]] was [[made]] first Chief [[Baron]] of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on [[25]] December 1676. [[Hale]] is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and [[jurist]], with his central legacy coming through his written work, published after his death. His Historia Placitorum Coronæ, dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is [[noted]] as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","Sir Matthew Hale SL (1 November [[109]] – 25 December 1676) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia [[Pacitorum]] Coronæ, or The History of the Pleas of the Crown.

Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian [[boy]] [[born]] in Floka and [[raised]] in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli.

They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 ft) tall. [[The]] leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long on young seedlings (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.079–0.315 in) long with only the apex free. The leaves are arranged in six rows along the twigs, in alternating whorls of three. The male cones are small, 3–6 mm (0.12–0.24 in) long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in eighteen to twenty months to 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long and wide, globular to acute-ovoid, with six thick, woody scales, arranged in two whorls of three, and a further nine to fifteen thin, sterile basal scales.

He [[played]] [[cricket]] for the West [[Indies]] and was the [[first]] [[person]] of known Chinese [[descent]] to play in a [[Test]] match. Left-arm unorthodox spin ([[left-arm]] wrist spin) is sometimes known as \""slow left-arm chinaman\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was born in Belmont, Port of Spain. He [[played]] football as a left-winger for a local team, Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better known for [[playing]] cricket. He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., \""fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the bowler or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed [[batsman]]) is known as a \""[[chinaman]]\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.25, but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929–30 and 1934–35. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He married during the 1933 tour of England and settled in Manchester. After his last Test match, he continued to play cricket for several clubs in the Lancashire Leagues until 1951, taking over 1,000 wickets, including 10 in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

Construction started in 1932, initial project was designed by architect Aleksandr Nikolsky and his workshop. During the 1930s and 1940s, construction was mainly focused on groundworks for the artificial mound on the sea shore. Construction was interrupted by the World War II and the Siege of Leningrad, and resumed in 1945 with the return of citizens to [[Leningrad]]. Thousands of Red Army and Red Navy recruits were also conscripted as [[labor]] [[force]] for construction. The [[stadium]] was open on 30 July 1950 with the game between two main Leningrad teams, Zenit and Dynamo, drew 1-1. Initially the [[stadium]] held 100,000 people (including 16,000 standing places). For the match between Zenit and CSKA on 14 July 1951, additional temporary stands were installed, increasing the capacity of the [[stadium]] to 110,000. The [[stadium]] was sold out, and the attendance of 110,000 is the record for the Soviet football. Kirov [[stadium]] was reconstructed to hold preliminary matches of the football tournament at the 1980 Summer Olympics. The capacity was reduced to 72,000. In 1994 the [[stadium]] was used as the main arena for the St. [[Petersburg]] 1994 Goodwill Games. This was the last major international event at the Kirov Stadium, with participation of athletes from over 50 nations of the world. After the Goodwill Games, the [[stadium]] was [[used]] for several more years for football matches, as well as for athletics and training. In 2005 it was decided to demolish the main arena of the stadium and build a new one in its place. International competition for construction design of the new Zenit [[Stadium]] was won by architect Kisho Kurokawa. The Kirov [[stadium]] was the home to Zenit football club in 1950-1989 and 1992. On 6 July 2006 Zenit decided to play a match against Dynamo [[Moscow]] at the Kirov stadium because of [[unavailability]] of pitch at the Petrovsky Stadium, the current Zenit ground. Part of the seats were already uninstalled because of planned [[deconstruction]], so the match was visited by only 45,000 spectators despite the sold-out stadium. The last official match at Kirov stadium was FC Petrotrest - Spartak Shelkovo on 17 August 2006. Visitors won 3-0. The stadium was demolished in September 2006.

He represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968. He made his Test match debut for South Africa against Australia at Durban in February 1970 while still a student, having been selected at the request of the South African captain Ali Bacher. He took four catches and three wickets in his debut Test. However, after his three appearances in this series, South Africa were banned from international [[cricket]] because of apartheid. Traicos continued to play for Rhodesia, and after the country was renamed in 1980 represented Zimbabwe in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 ICC Trophy tournaments.

"The [[Usoi]] Dam is a natural [[landslide]] dam along the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. At [[567]] metres (1,[[860]] ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or man-made. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms [[Sarez]] earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the [[flow]] of the river. The [[dam]] is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of rock dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the [[Murghab]], which cuts from east to west through the high and rough [[Pamir]] Mountains. [[It]] is named after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the [[1911]] landslide. The dam rises to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor. The basin formed by [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] now holds [[Sarez]] Lake, a 55.8-kilometre (34.7 mi)-long lake holding 16.[[074]] cubic kilometres (13,[[031]],000 acre·ft) of water. Water does not flow over the top of the [[dam]], which would quickly cause it to erode away; instead, water [[seeps]] out of the base of the dam at a rate which approximately matches the [[rate]] of [[inflow]], maintaining the lake at a relatively constant level. The flow averages about 45 cubic meters per second, and dissipates about 250 [[megawatts]]. Geologists are concerned that the [[Usoi]] Dam may become unstable during future large-magnitude earthquakes, which are relatively common in the seismically active Pamirs, and might collapse due to liquefaction or subsequent landslides during such an event. Collapse of the dam would [[unleash]] a locally catastrophic flood. The [[Murghab's]] river valley tends to be relatively narrow and steep.

WCWS [[broadcasts]] 1050 watts of power at a frequency of 90.9 MHz to Wayne and neighboring counties. Under the FCC Table of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, WNZR, also operates at 90.9 MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential. Students share the administrative duties of running the station with a faculty adviser, currently John Finn, to oversee them. Herman Gibbs is the chief operator/engineer of WCWS, and has served in that role since 1984. [[Radio]] at the College of Wooster began back in the 1950s [[broadcasting]] music and local programs as well as campus activities in mono to the greater Wooster community. The 1980s saw the addition of a satellite dish to [[broadcast]] Metropolitan Opera programs on Saturday afternoons.

In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian [[radio]] group, challenged WCWS and other [[radio]] [[stations]] during the [[FCC]] licence renewal process. Due to the efforts of the College of Wooster administration, Herman Gibbs, John Finn, and the student management, the [[FCC]] denied the challenge in May 2005.

Overlord is set in a [[fantasy]] world, where the player takes the role of a resurrected warrior known simply as The [[Overlord]] who has control over hordes of gremlin-like creatures known as \""minions\"". The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \""be evil... or really evil\"", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and [[gameplay]].

After over a year and a half of development, its release in 2007 was met with generally favourable reviews and helped boost overall sales for [[odemasters]] that year. An expansion pack entitled [[Overolrd]]: Raising Hell was announced on November 1, 2007 and [[relsased]] February 15, 2008 along with additional multiplayer maps and a local split screen co-op mode. A [[PlaSytation]] 3 [[vrsion]] of the [[agme]] also entitled Overlord: Raising Hell was released in 2008 in Europe on June 20, and June 24 in North America, which included both the original [[gmae]] and its [[downloadabl]] content. A sequel for all three systems entitled Overlord II was announced the same year on August 13 along with a spin-off for the Wii entitled [[OverlGrd]]: Dark Legend and a Nintendo DS [[same]] called [[Overord]]: Minions. A Linux version is under development. Overlord is set in a [[fnatasy]] world, where the player takes the role of a resurrected warrior known simply as The [[OvFerlord]] who has control over hordes of gremlin-like creatures known as \""minions\"". The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \""be evil... or really evil\"", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and [[gamteplay]]. While the [[Ovenrlord]] is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game also uses black humour and is [[ofteP]] a satire and parody of the traditional [[fiantasy]] setting and plot.",0.005291104316711426,0.0060572028160095215,1,1,1,326,"Failed"

"Faxinalipterus is a genus of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic Caturrita Formation of southern Brazil. The type [[species]], [[Faxinalipterus]] minima was named and [[described]] in 2010 by José Fernando [[Bonaparte]], Marina [[Bento]] [[Soares]] and César Leandro Schultz. The [[generic]] name is derived from [[Faxinal]] do Soturno and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific name, from Latin minimus, means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of [[Faxinal]] do Soturno, Rio Grande do Sul, from the [[Caturrita]] Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian, 220–215 million years old. The [[holotype]], [[UFRGS]] PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a single individual. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. [[Faxinalipterus]] is a rather [[small]] animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned [[Faxinalipterus]] to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the [[Caturrita]] Formation consists of [[terrestrial]] sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a [[terrestrial]], not coastal, habitat. They also concluded [[Faxinalipterus]] is the most basal known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a [[coracoid]] that has not fused to the [[scapula]]. However, Alexander [[Kellner]] has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"". Dalla Vecchia did not consider Faxinalipterus to be a pterosaur, but did not state what group of vertebrates it belonged to.","Faxinalipterus is a genus of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic Caturrita Formation of southern Brazil.

[[Foaxinalipterus]] is a rather [[soall]] animal, with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The hind limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and recurved. The describers have assigned [[Faxinalipteru]] to the Pterosauria, based on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly predates European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of rapid evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the [[Clturrita]] Formation consists of [[Dterrestrial]] sandstones, that evolution would have had its origins in a [[Iterrestrial]], not coastal, habitat. They also concluded [[Fxainalipterus]] is the most basal known pterosaur, basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a [[cSoracoid]] that has not fused to the [[scaula]]. However, Alexander [[Kelnler]] has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"". Dalla Vecchia did not consider Faxinalipterus to be a pterosaur, but did not state what group of vertebrates it belonged to.",0.0038388967514038086,0.004104137420654297,3,3,3,443,"Failed"

"Sarcosphaera is a fungal genus within the Pezizaceae family. It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Sarcosphaera coronaria, commonly known as the pink crown, the violet crown-cup, or the violet [[star]] cup.

It is commonly [[found]] in the mountains in [[coniferous]] woods under [[humus]] on the [[forest]] floor, and often appears after the snow melts in late spring and early [[summer]]. The fungus is widespread, and has been collected in Europe, Israel and the Asian part of Turkey, North Africa, and North America.

Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and [[built]] the [[monastery]] of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the [[details]] of the [[monastery's]] problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the [[Cluniac]] or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ... [[He]] still held both Lincluden and [[Kirkmahoe]] on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and [[prebend]] of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus [[retained]] his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. [[In]] that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II. In a lost MacDowall [[charter]], witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration. Nothing more is [[known]] about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed.","[[Elisaeur]] [[Adougn]] was a late 14th century and early 15th century [[Scottih]] [[cleri]].
