In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions.

"DDO 190 (or UGC 9240) is a dwarf [[irregular]] [[galaxy]] in the vicinity of the [[Milky]] Way, as it is relatively small and lacks clear structure. It is 9.10 million light-years (2.79 Mpc) away from us and lies out of the Local Group, determined by the tip of the red giant branch method. The outskirts of the galaxy are harbouring older (reddish) stars, while the centre is crowded with younger (bluish) stars. Heated gas is observed at several places. DDO 190 still experiences some active star formation. The [[galaxy]] is categorised as a Magellanic dwarf [[galaxy]] of morphological type Im. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] = −1.55 ± 0.12.

"Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the Serpent (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fabricated]] [[quality]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

In December 1947 a combined Pontypool, Talywain and Blaenavon side played against the Australian national team at Pontypool Park as part of a post-war rebuilding tour. The game ended with Australia winning 9-7.

"Girl Germs was a zine created by University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, both members of the band Bratmobile. Feminism was influential in the Pacific Northwest in the early nineties: Girl Germs heralded an explosion of zines that accompanied the rebirth of feminism. These zines included Ms America,Satan Wears A Bra, Fantastic Fanzine, I (heart) Amy Carter and others. Girl Germs identified feminist role models in its early issues and was one of the few Riot grrrl zines created by young white women to feature African American rappers.

"Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is the [[highest]] [[point]] of [[land]] in the Canadian [[province]] of Ontario, at an [[estimated]] 693 m (2,274 ft) above sea [[level]]. Ishpatina [[Ridge]] [[rises]] [[approximately]] [[300]] m (984 ft) above the [[immediate]] [[area]]. It was only [[truly]] [[recognized]] as Ontario's [[highest]] [[point]] after [[federal]] [[government]] topographical [[mapping]] [[revealed]] this fact in the [[1970s]]. [[Before]] then, the more [[popular]] Maple [[Mountain]] was [[thought]] to be [[higher]]. The [[ridge]] [[lies]] in [[Lady]] Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial [[Park]]. [[Due]] to its [[remote]] [[location]], Ishpatina [[Ridge]] is a [[challenge]] to [[reach]]. The [[closest]] major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 [[km]] [[north]]. There are a few logging [[roads]] and [[trails]] in the [[remote]] [[area]], but they are [[difficult]] to [[travel]] in [[poor]] [[weather]]. The most [[popular]] [[approach]] [[route]] to Ishpatina is by canoe/portage via a logging road to the [[south]] out of the town of Capreol [[north]] of Sudbury. [[While]] a northern [[route]] [[exists]] (out of Gowganda, the [[nearest]] community), there are [[numerous]] [[portages]] [[making]] it [[particularly]] onerous. This [[route]] has traditionally been [[used]] for a winter-time [[approach]] by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire [[tower]] atop the ridge was [[staffed]] by forest [[workers]] and they would have been ferried to the [[site]] by float [[plane]]. The [[name]] \""Ishpatina\"" [[comes]] from an Ojibwe language [[word]] ishpadinaa, [[meaning]] \""[[high]] [[place]]/ridge\"". The city of Ishpeming, Michigan, in Marquette County, and Spadina [[Avenue]] in Toronto, Ontario [[derive]] their [[names]] from the same [[word]]. Although the Ishpatina Ridge is the [[highest]] [[point]] in Ontario, at least [[one]] other [[geographic]] [[feature]], Maple [[Mountain]] (approximately [[25]] [[km]] to the [[east]]) has [[greater]] [[prominence]], 37 m (121 ft) [[higher]] than Ishpatina Ridge's [[rise]] over Scarecrow Lake. An [[abandoned]] firetower, [[often]] [[referred]] to as the Ellis [[Tower]], is [[still]] [[standing]] on the [[highest]] [[section]] of the Ridge (left). The original [[tower]] was an [[80]] ft [[structure]] [[erected]] in 1930. The successor, currently [[standing]], is [[100]] ft [[high]] and was [[abandoned]] in the [[1960s]].

"The West Coast Main [[Line]] (WCML) is a major inter-city [[railway]] [[route]] in the United Kingdom. It is Britain's most important rail backbone in terms of population served. The route links Greater London, the West Midlands, the North West, North Wales and the Central Belt of Scotland. The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h).

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010. The group performed live on Conan on May 11, 2015 and toured the United States that summer and fall.","The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[set]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization.

The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania. The Cut-Off was 11 miles (18 km) shorter than the Lackawanna Old Road, the rail line it superseded; it had a much gentler ruling gradient (0.55% vs. 1.1%); and it had 42 fewer curves, with all but one permitting passenger train speeds of 70 mph (110 km/h) or more.

"Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] [[pass]] in the Jura Mountains in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It connects Sonceboz and Tavannes. The name of the pass comes from the Latin: Petra pertusa, meaning broken rock. The pass road has been dated to the second half of the 1st century AD. A 159 by 96 centimetres (63 in × 38 in) large inscription on the north side of the road lists Marcus Dunius Paternus, the duumvir of the Helvetii Colony Aventicum, as the builder of the road. This inscription honors the emperor and dates to around 200 AD. It probably refers to the renovation and expansion of the existing road and the widening of the rocky gate leading into the pass. The pass road connected the Aventicum (modern Avenches)-Salodurum (modern Solothurn)-Augusta Raurica road with the Vesontio (modern Besançon)-Epomanduodurum (modern Mandeure)-Kembs road. The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant Reformation. The first modern road was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel. This road linked the cities of Basel and Biel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the pass became part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the surrounding area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Bern widened part of the pass road in a section between Bözingen (now part of Biel) and Courtelary. In 1874 a railway tunnel was completed through the pass which linked Sonceboz-Tavannes. The first road that was passable for automobiles was built during World War I by the corps of engineers of the Swiss Army. In 1932, a new road was built employing the jobless due to the Great Depression. In November 1997, a 2100-meter-long tunnel was opened for the A-16 Autobahn.","Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mint]] [[fleet]] in the Jura Mountains in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

The pass was first mentioned in a record from 1179 as the boundary between the dioceses of Lausanne and Basel. It remained the border between the powerful bishops until the Protestant Reformation. The first modern road was built in 1752 by the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey and the Vogt of Erguel. This road linked the cities of Basel and Biel. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, the pass became part of France. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, the pass and the surrounding area were assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Bern widened part of the pass road in a section between Bözingen (now part of Biel) and Courtelary. In 1874 a railway tunnel was completed through the pass which linked Sonceboz-Tavannes. The first road that was passable for automobiles was built during World War I by the corps of engineers of the Swiss Army. In 1932, a new road was built employing the jobless due to the Great Depression. In November 1997, a 2100-meter-long tunnel was opened for the A-16 Autobahn.",0.010628461837768555,0.9304409027099609,2,0,2,1802,"Successful"
