"Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small [[insectivorous]] songbirds (\""warblers\""), formerly placed in the Old World warbler \""wastebin\"" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used.

The monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), tit hylia Pholidornis and green hylia (Hylia) are exclusively [[found]] in the forests of Africa. The pseudo-tailorbirds, tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and Abroscopus warblers are mostly found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia, with [[one]] species [[reaching]] as far north as Japan and Siberia.

Acuña retired from active play after the 1978 PBA All-Filipino Conference and began serving as assistant coach for Toyota. On December 11 1979, he replaced Dante Silverio as Toyota head coach after Silverio resigned when management decides to reinstate Ramon Fernandez, Estoy Estrada and Abe King for Game 2 of the ongoing PBA Invitational Conference finals. Acuña steered the team to the title against arch-rivals Crispa. This was Toyota's sixth title and Acuña's only PBA championship as head coach.

Archaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. During the Middle Ages, the town rose to national significance with the establishment of Northampton Castle, which was an occasional royal residence and regularly hosted the Parliament of England.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

It is in a Lissajous [[orbit]] at the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point, 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from Earth, to monitor variable solar wind condition, provide early warning of approaching coronal mass ejections and observe phenomena on Earth including changes in ozone, aerosols, dust and volcanic ash, cloud height, vegetation cover and climate. At this [[location]] it has a continuous view of the Sun and the sunlit side of the Earth. The [[satellite]] is orbiting the Sun-Earth L1 point in a six-month period, with a [[spacecraft-Earth-Sun]] angle varying from 4 to 15 degrees.

In the general election, he faced his first Republican opponent, Porter Carswell (1904-?) of Burke County, who held Hagan to a [[58-42]]% margin. In 1968, he would face desultory opposition in the primary and defeated Savannah Republican State Senator and former Georgia Republican Party chairman Joe Tribble (1920–[[2003]]) by a [[68-32]]% margin.

"[[3070]] [[Aitken]], [[provisional]] [[designation]] 1949 GK, is a stony Flora [[asteroid]] from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana [[Asteroid]] Program of Indiana University at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The used first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the asteroid was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010. The light-curve gave a rotation period of 6.3965±0.0026 hours with a [[brightness]] amplitude of 0.[[38]] in magnitude (U=2).

"[[Pandora]] (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; [[Greek]]: Πανδώρα) is an inner [[satellite]] of Saturn. It was [[discovered]] in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 [[probe]], and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's [[surface]]. The [[orbit]] of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their [[orbits]] occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the [[moons]] approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi).

"[[Samuel]] [[Harvey]] [[Shapiro]] ([[born]] [[Israel]] [[Shapiro]]) ([[April]] [[25]], 1907 – March [[16]], [[1987]]) was the 34th Governor of [[Illinois]], serving from 1968 to 1969. He was a [[member]] of the Democratic Party. [[Born]] in 1907 in the Governorate of Estonia of the [[Russian]] [[Empire]], he emigrated to the [[United]] States at an early age. He graduated from the University of Illinois College of Law. [[As]] a [[lawyer]], Shapiro practiced in Kankakee, Illinois. Turning to public [[service]], he was elected state's attorney ([[county]] prosecutor) of Kankakee County in 1936. From 1947-61 he served in the Illinois State House of Representatives, where he took a special interest in mental health issues. Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant [[Governor]] of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto [[Kerner]], Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro thus became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first). Illinois thereby became the first state to have had two Jewish governors; New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have each since elected at least a second governor of the faith. Upon becoming governor, Shapiro ran at once for a full term of his own, but was narrowly defeated by Republican Richard B. Ogilvie in the 1968 election. He then returned to private life, although he was called upon several times to serve on special commissions, the most significant of which was a commission to redraw state electoral boundaries in 1981. Shapiro was an [[alumnus]] of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. From 1984 until his death, he led the effort to establish a permanent headquarters for the fraternity's national offices. As a result, Alpha Epsilon Pi's International Headquarters is dedicated in his honor.

He was a [[memfber]] of the Democratic Party. [[Bmorn]] in 1907 in the Governorate of Estonia of the [[RussiaW]] [[Empre]], he emigrated to the [[Unied]] States at an early age. He graduated from the University of Illinois College of Law. [[Ae]] a [[lakwyer]], Shapiro practiced in Kankakee, Illinois. Turning to public [[sejrvice]], he was elected state's attorney ([[Eounty]] prosecutor) of Kankakee County in 1936. From 1947-61 he served in the Illinois State House of Representatives, where he took a special interest in mental health issues. Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant [[GoBvernor]] of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto [[Kernr]], Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro thus became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first). Illinois thereby became the first state to have had two Jewish governors; New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have each since elected at least a second governor of the faith. Upon becoming governor, Shapiro ran at once for a full term of his own, but was narrowly defeated by Republican Richard B. Ogilvie in the 1968 election. He then returned to private life, although he was called upon several times to serve on special commissions, the most significant of which was a commission to redraw state electoral boundaries in 1981. Shapiro was an [[alumnXs]] of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. From 1984 until his death, he led the effort to establish a permanent headquarters for the fraternity's national offices. As a result, Alpha Epsilon Pi's International Headquarters is dedicated in his honor. Shapiro continued to work as an [[attorey]]; his death was discovered when he failed to appear in court for a [[cDlient]] and police were sent to his home in [[Kankakuee]] to investigate. He is buried in Jewish Waldheim Cemetery in Forest Park, [[IYlinois]]. The state renamed the Kankakee Mental Health Center in his honor.",0.0008472204208374023,0.001077115535736084,0,0,0,335,"Failed"

"[[3043]] San Diego, provisional designation [[1982]] [[SA]], is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and [[slow]] rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. [[The]] bright [[E-type]] [[asteroid]] is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months ([[977]] [[days]]). [[Its]] orbit has an eccentricity of 0.[[11]] and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first [[observation]] was [[taken]] at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's [[observation]] arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.[[60]] in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of [[NASA's]] Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its [[surface]] has an albedo of 0.[[28]], while the Collaborative [[Asteroid]] Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the [[Hungaria]] asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. [[The]] minor [[planet]] was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the [[site]] were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out.

[[It]] [[rises]] south of [[Grantham]] [[close]] to South [[Witham]] at SK8818, passes Lincoln at [[SK9771]] and at Boston, TF3244, [[flows]] into [[The]] Haven, a tidal [[arm]] of The Wash, near RSPB Frampton Marsh. [[The]] name \""Witham\"" seems to be extremely old and of unknown origin. [[Archaeological]] and [[documentary]] evidence shows the importance of the Witham as a navigation from the Iron Age onwards. From Roman times it was navigable to Lincoln, from where the Fossdyke was constructed to link it to the River Trent. The mouth of the [[river]] moved in 1014 following severe flooding, and Boston became important as a port. From 1142 onwards, sluices were constructed to prevent flooding by the sea, and this culminated in the Great Sluice, which was constructed in 1766. It maintained river levels above Boston, and helped to scour the channel below it. The land through which the lower river runs has been the subject of much land drainage, and many drains are connected to the Witham by flood doors, which block them off if river levels rise rapidly. The river is navigable from Brayford Pool in Lincoln to Boston. Its locks are at Lincoln, Bardney and the Grand/Great Sluice. Passage through the latter is restricted typically to 12-hour intervals during daylight when the tidal levels are suitable.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] Company is a [[brewery]] in Easton, [[Pennsylvania]], [[United]] States, [[founded]] in 1995 by [[Dan]] and [[Sue]] Weirback. [[The]] [[brewery]] is well [[known]] for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

"[[Martin]] Bruce [[Cameron]] ([[born]] 24 August 1936), Australian [[politician]], was a member of the Australian [[Senate]] and the South Australian Legislative Council. In 1968 Cameron contested the safe Labor House of Assembly seat of Millicent for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of [[Disputed]] Returns, which ordered a by-election. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL Legislative Councillors, due to his support for Universal [[Suffrage]] for that chamber. This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement [[originally]] functioned as a [[faction]] within the LCL. Cameron was [[one]] of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the [[LCL]] ([[led]] at this stage by Bruce Eastick) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement [[members]], such as future [[Premiers]] David [[Tonkin]] and [[Dean]] [[Brown]], decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron [[left]] with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 Election when he was joined by [[John]] [[Carnie]]. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the [[LCL]] ([[renamed]] the [[Liberal]] Party of Australia in [[1974]]), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification. In 1976 Cameron and Hall rejoined the Liberal Party, while Millhouse initially formed the New LM before helping found the Australian Democrats. Despite not serving in the Tonkin ministry, Cameron assumed the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council after the election of the John Bannon Labor government at the 1982 Elections. He held this position until his retirement from politics in 1990. Following his retirement from the Council, Cameron served a term as president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party. Later, he became a vocal supporter of the 'yes' case in the 1999 republic referendum.","[[nartin]] Bruce [[Cmaeron]] ([[obrn]] 24 August 1936), Australian [[pYlitician]], was a member of the Australian [[Sente]] and the South Australian Legislative Council. In 1968 Cameron contested the safe Labor House of Assembly seat of Millicent for the Liberal and Country League (LCL) after objecting to the views of incumbent Des Corcoran on road transport control. Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of [[Disptued]] Returns, which ordered a by-election. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election. Early in 1969, Senator Keith Laught died suddenly and Cameron was nominated by Premier Steele Hall as his replacement. However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the vacancy was held to coincide with the 1969 Federal Election in October and he was defeated by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). Cameron entered South Australia's Legislative Council in 1971 following the retirement of Sir Norman Jude. He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party. Cameron often opposed his fellow LCL Legislative Councillors, due to his support for Universal [[SuffraLe]] for that chamber. This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement [[originaly]] functioned as a [[factoin]] within the LCL. Cameron was [[cone]] of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the [[GCL]] ([[lde]] at this stage by Bruce Eastick) expelled the Liberal Movement. Although some Liberal Movement [[membeTrs]], such as future [[Premirs]] David [[Tonkrn]] and [[hDean]] [[Brow]], decided to remain in the LCL, Cameron [[let]] with Hall and Millhouse. Cameron was the only Liberal Movement member of the Legislative Council until the 1975 Election when he was joined by [[ohn]] [[Cqarnie]]. However the Liberal Movement was vastly outpolled by the [[JCL]] ([[reeamed]] the [[Libearl]] Party of Australia in [[194]]), and there was a push from within both parties for reunification.

Lesh was the last [[membr]] to join the [[Warocks]] before they became the Grateful [[Ded]]; he replaced [[Dan]] Morgan [[r]]., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of [[MKcernan]], who [[die]] in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from [[171]] to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official [[memers]] of the band are [[om]] Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna [[Podchaux]] (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring [[membhr]] from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts. And some members of the band started touring as Dead & Company in 2015. There have also been several spin-offs featuring band members, such as Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, RatDog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Hart and Kreutzmann.",0.006308436393737793,0.010977864265441895,0,0,0,1044,"Failed"

"The Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company (HB&WRJR&DCo.) was opened on 20 July 1885. It had a total projected length of 66 miles but never reached Barnsley, stopping a few miles short at Stairfoot. The name was changed to The Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&BR) in 1905. Its Alexandra Dock in Hull opened 16 July 1885. The main line ran from Hull to Cudworth, with two other lines branching off at Wrangbrook Junction, the South Yorkshire Junction Railway to Denaby, and The Hull & South Yorkshire Extension Railway, an eight-mile branch to Wath-upon-Dearne, opened 31 March 1902. The company also had joint running powers on the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway (Gowdall and Braithwell Railway). Before the Grouping of 1923, the line was taken over by the North Eastern Railway (NER).

"[[Willie]] “The [[Wisp]]” Galimore ([[March]] 30, 1935 – July [[27]], [[1964]]) was an [[American]] [[football]] running [[back]] for the [[Chicago]] Bears from 1957–1963. [[He]] attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced.

"[[Ascomycota]] is a division or [[phylum]] of the [[kingdom]] [[Fungi]] that, [[together]] with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya. [[Its]] members are commonly [[known]] as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. They are the [[largest]] phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[species]]. The defining feature of this [[fungal]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός ([[askos]]), meaning \""[[sac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[species]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with [[asexual]] [[species]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphological]] or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The [[ascomycetes]] are a [[monophyletic]] group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic [[ascomycetes]], including apple [[scab]], rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews. Several species of ascomycetes are biological model organisms in laboratory research. Most famously, Neurospora crassa, several species of yeasts, and Aspergillus [[species]] are used in many genetics and cell biology studies. Penicillium [[species]] on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial infectious diseases are examples of taxa that belong to the Ascomycota.","[[Ascomyctoa]] is a division or [[Uhylum]] of the [[kingdmo]] [[Fung]] that, [[togetehr]] with the Basidiomycota, form the subkingdom Dikarya.

The defining feature of this [[fungaGl]] group is the \""ascus\"" (from Greek: ἀσκός ([[askios]]), meaning \""[[ac]]\"" or \""wineskin\""), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some [[speciehs]] of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores. Previously placed in the Deuteromycota along with [[asexusal]] [[kspecies]] from other fungal taxa, asexual (or anamorphic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[omorphological]] or physiological similarities to ascus-bearing taxa, and by [[phyolgenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences. The [[ascomycetse]] are a [[monphyletic]] group, i.e. it contains all descendants of one common ancestor. This group is of particular relevance to humans as sources for medicinally important compounds, such as antibiotics and for making bread, alcoholic beverages, and cheese, but also as pathogens of humans and plants. Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \""ascolichens\"") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota. There are many plant-pathogenic [[ascomycees]], including apple [[sacb]], rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews. Several species of ascomycetes are biological model organisms in laboratory research. Most famously, Neurospora crassa, several species of yeasts, and Aspergillus [[speies]] are used in many genetics and cell biology studies. Penicillium [[specmes]] on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial infectious diseases are examples of taxa that belong to the Ascomycota.",0.0016624927520751953,0.0017488598823547363,3,3,3,294,"Failed"

The WCML is the most important intercity rail passenger route in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh which have a combined metropolitan population of over 24 million people. In addition, several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing a number of links to more rural towns. In 2008 the WCML handled 75 million passenger journeys. The WCML is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 43% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. Since an upgrade in recent years, much of the line has a maximum speed of 125 mph (201 km/h), thereby meeting the European Union's definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only the Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Super Voyagers operated by Virgin Trains are permitted to travel up to that speed, as they have tilting mechanisms and can travel through curves faster than conventional trains. Other traffic, including the Class 350s, are limited to 110 mph (177 km/h).

"[[Ishpatina]] [[Ridge]] is the highest [[point]] of [[land]] in the Canadian province of Ontario, at an estimated 693 m (2,274 ft) above sea level.

Before then, the more popular Maple Mountain was thought to be higher. The [[ridge]] [[lies]] in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial [[Park]]. Due to its remote location, Ishpatina Ridge is a challenge to reach. The closest major highway, Highway 560, is more than 30 km [[north]]. [[There]] are a few logging roads and trails in the remote area, but they are difficult to travel in poor weather. The most popular approach route to Ishpatina is by canoe/[[portage]] via a logging road to the south out of the town of Capreol north of Sudbury. While a northern route exists (out of Gowganda, the nearest community), there are numerous portages making it particularly onerous. This route has traditionally been used for a winter-time approach by ski/snowshoe. Historically, a fire tower atop the [[ridge]] was staffed by forest workers and they would have been ferried to the site by float plane.

After [[graduating]] from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly [[practiced]] [[law]] in New York before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He [[parlayed]] that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady [[Phyllis]] George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state. Beshear's initial rise to political prominence was interrupted in 1987 when he finished third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a [[come-from-behind]] upset in the race.

In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social [[programs]] like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith.

This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream. From that day forth, Tamura is determined to assert his heterosexuality, even going as far as reading porn while in class. He continues this behavior even as he enters high school. One day Tamura passes out after seeing fellow student Narumi Seiwa in class. It is revealed that Seiwa is the man he is always having sex with in his foreseeing dream. Later when Seiwa meets him out of dumb curiosity (wondering how someone can pass out from just seeing someone else) Tamura tries to avoid Seiwa.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

In 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships.

The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545.

They mainly eat insects, but some larger species are able to catch small fish. They can also climb beneath the water, when they become encased in a [[silvery]] film of air. Six-spotted spiders can also walk on water to get their prey. Dolomedes is derived from the Greek word \""dolomed\"" which means wily, deceitful.

Six-spotted spiders can also walk on water to get their prey. Dolomedes is derived from the Greek word \""dolomed\"" which means wily, deceitful.

The line was part of a 400-mile (640 km) main line between Hoboken, New Jersey, and Buffalo, New York. The Cut-Off ran west for 28.5 miles (45.9 km) from Port Morris Junction — near the south end of Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey, about 45 miles (72 km) west-northwest of New York City — to Slateford Junction near the Delaware Water Gap in Pennsylvania.

"The Taradale [[Viaduct]] is a large wrought iron box girder bridge over Back Creek at Taradale, Victoria on the Bendigo Railway in Victoria Australia. It was erected as part of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway between 1858 and 1861, and was at the time one of the largest rail bridges built in Australia. Construction of the Bendigo line commenced under the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1858, but this private consortium met with financial difficulties when it was unable to raise sufficient funds, and was bought out by the Victorian colonial government in 1860 when it formed the Victorian Railways Department. The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R. E., Surveyor-General of Victoria, with the bridge designs completed by Bryson and O'Hara The ironwork for the bridge was made by Rowland Brotherhood, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, under the supervision of British Railway engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The foundation stone was laid by Mr. W. S. Urquhart Wednesday 25 September 1861 The contract for the first stage of the line from Footscray to Sandhurst (now Bendigo), was let to Cornish and Bruce for £3,356,937.2s.2d ($6.714 million) with work commencing on 1 June 1858. Completion of the permanent way was to be by 31 July 1861. Clarke appointed William O’Hara to design bridges and viaducts, while William Edward Bryson stated to the Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly on Railway Contracts that he had designed most of the large bridges on the line. Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line. However, this was also a very costly undertaking, which stretched the colonial finances and this approach was later abandoned for more economic light lines in later Australian Railways.

In third position in the 18-team league, only one point behind the leaders, with eight matches remaining, they gained only four points from the sixteen available, and finished seventh. [[They]] also took part in the 1904–05 FA Cup, entering at the first round proper and losing to Portsmouth in that round. In locally organised competition, they won the Birmingham Senior Cup for the first time, defeating West Bromwich Albion by seven goals to two. After this season, the club entered a primarily reserve team for this competition, which had previously not been permitted. Nineteen players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were nine different goalscorers. Goalkeeper Nat Robinson, full-back Frank Stokes and forward Benny Green were all ever-present over the 35-match season. Billy Jones was leading scorer with 16 goals, all of which came in the league. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in March 1905, it was proposed that, Small Heath being the only major football club in the city since Birmingham St George's had folded in 1892, the club should be renamed Birmingham City F.C. The shareholders were not in favour, though they were prepared to go as far as plain Birmingham Football Club instead. Even this was a step too far for some; one reporter referred to \""the Small Heath club now masquerading as Birmingham\"". Events surrounding the February 1905 match with Aston Villa highlighted the Coventry Road ground's inadequacies. The official attendance was given as 28,000, though with the gates closed before kick-off, thousands scaled walls or forced entrances in order to gain admission, and the actual attendance was estimated at anything up to 35,000.

"Frederick [[Charles]] 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894 – November 1972) was a Welsh professional [[footballer]] and Wales international. He [[began]] his career at his hometown club [[Cardiff]] City after impressing in a trial match in 1912 that was organised by his former [[schoolteacher]]. A hard-tackling Defender, he appeared sporadically for the team in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, which became known as the Football Battalion, led by Major Frank Buckley. During the conflict, he [[fought]] in the Battle of the [[Somme]], suffering a severe shrapnel [[wound]] to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the [[rank]] of sergeant. Overcoming doubts about the possibility of playing football again following his shrapnel wound, Keenor returned to football with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history, winning [[promotion]] to the First [[Division]] one season after joining the Football League in [[1920]] and helping the club to an [[FA]] [[Cup]] final in 1925, suffering a 1–0 defeat to [[Sheffield]] United. In 1926, he replaced the departing Jimmy Blair as club captain, leading the team to success in the 1927 FA Cup Final later in the season, where they defeated Arsenal 1–0. [[To]] date, this is the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England's borders. He remained with the Bluebirds until 1931, when an ageing squad had entered a decline that culminated with relegation to the Third Division South in the 1930–31 season, when he was released. During his time at Ninian Park, he made over 500 appearances for the club, [[winning]] four Welsh Cup titles, the FA Cup and the FA Charity Shield in a 19-year association with the side and is regarded as one of the clubs all-time greats.

Keenor finished his career with spells at Crewe Alexandra, [[Oswestry]] Town and Tunbridge Wells. During his career, he also gained 32 caps for the Wales national [[football]] team, helping the side win the British Home Championship on three [[occasions]] in 1920, [[1924]] and 1928, and captained the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals.

"Sir Matthew [[Hale]] SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December [[1676]]) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treatise]] Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the [[Pleas]] of the Crown. Born to a barrister and his [[wife]], who had both died by the time he was 5, Hale was raised by his [[father's]] relative, a strict [[Puritan]], and inherited his faith. In 1626 he matriculated at [[Magdalen]] Hall, Oxford (now Hertford [[College]]), intending to become a priest, but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] in a dispute over his [[estate]]. On 8 November 1628 he joined [[Lincoln's]] Inn, where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636. As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of [[Royalist]] figures during the [[prelude]] and duration of the English Civil [[War]], including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles [[used]]. Despite the [[Royalist]] [[loss]], Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any [[repercussions]], and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles [[II's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[King's]] [[Bench]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written [[work]], published after his death. His Historia Placitorum [[Coronæ]], dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.","Sir Matthew [[Hal]] SL (1 November 1609 – 25 December [[167V]]) was an influential English barrister, judge and lawyer most noted for his [[treatsie]] Historia Placitorum Coronæ, or The History of the [[Pelas]] of the Crown.

As a barrister, Hale represented a variety of [[Royalst]] figures during the [[prlude]] and duration of the English Civil [[Wwr]], including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial, and conceived the defence Charles [[sued]]. Despite the [[RoyaZlist]] [[olss]], Hale's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any [[repeqrcussions]], and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission, which investigated law reform. Following the Commission's dissolution, Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas. As a judge, Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles [[Il's]] reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the [[ing's]] [[Benh]]. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, although not as a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676. Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist, with his central legacy coming through his written [[wor]], published after his death. His Historia Placitorum [[Cxoronæ]], dealing with capital offences against the Crown, is considered \""of the highest authority\"", while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. Hale's jurisprudence struck a middle-ground between Edward Coke's \""appeal to reason\"" and John Selden's \""appeal to contract\"", while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes's theory of natural law. His thoughts on marital rape, expressed in the Historia, continued in English law until 1991, and he was cited in court as recently as 2009.",0.0008668303489685059,0.0009199380874633789,0,0,0,511,"Failed"

"Herbert [[Alexander]] [[Bruce]] FRCS ([[September]] [[28]], 1868 – June [[23]], [[1963]]), [[served]] as the [[15th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], from 1932 to 1937. [[Born]] in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel in the Canadian Army (Permanent Active Militia). Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. Few of his recommendations for general reorganization were immediately feasible from the military and economic points-of-view, and the manner of his [[appointment]] was protested by Sir William Osler as an affront to the medical profession. Bruce's report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his [[duties]], while his conservative patron, Hughes, was obliged to resign. In 1919, Bruce published Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps, criticizing the government for its [[actions]] but avoiding any specific denunciation of Hughes. Later in the war, as [[surgical]] [[consultant]] to the British forces, Bruce was able to advance some useful reforms in surgical management, including [[greater]] reliance on nurse-anesthetists and operating [[room]] technicians. In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview [[Avenue]] [[overlooking]] the Don [[Valley]] and built a Tudor-style [[mansion]] which he named Annandale. In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. His autobiography,  Varied Operations, was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963.

They are shrubs or small trees, reaching 3–8 m (9.8–26.2 [[ft]]) tall. The leaves are evergreen, of two forms; juvenile needle-like leaves 10–20 mm (0.39–0.79 in) long on young [[seedlings]] (but occasional into adulthood in A. acuminatus), and scale-like adult leaves, 2–8 mm (0.[[079]]–0.315 in) long with only the apex free.

"Col de Pierre Pertuis (el. 827 m.) is a [[mountain]] [[pass]] in the Jura [[Mountains]] in the [[canton]] of Bern in [[Switzerland]]. It connects Sonceboz and Tavannes.

"[[Ellis]] Edgar \""[[Puss]]\"" [[Achong]] ([[16]] February 1904 – 29 August [[1986]]) was a [[sportsman]] from Trinidad and Tobago in the West Indies. He played cricket for the West Indies and was the first person of known Chinese descent to play in a Test match. Left-arm unorthodox spin (left-arm wrist spin) is sometimes known as \""slow left-arm chinaman\"" (SLC) which is thought to be in his honour. Achong was [[born]] in Belmont, Port of Spain. He played [[football]] as a left-winger for a local team, Maple, in the 1920s and 1930s, and represented Trinidad and Tobago from 1919 to 1932. Achong is better [[known]] for playing cricket. He was mainly a [[bowler]]. His stock ball was left-arm orthodox spin (left-arm finger spin), but one of his variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., \""[[fancy]] being done by a bloody Chinaman\"". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: \""Do you mean the [[bowler]] or the ball?\"" An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a \""[[chinaman]]\"" as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa. Achong played in six Test matches for the West Indies against the English cricket team from 1930 to 1935, three in the West Indies and three in the 1933 tour of England. In all, Achong took eight Test wickets at a bowling average of 47.[[25]], but his Test figures belie his much greater success at regional level in the West Indies between 1929–30 and 1934–35. In the final of the Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana. He [[married]] during the 1933 tour of England and settled in Manchester. After his last Test [[match]], he continued to [[play]] [[cricket]] for several clubs in the [[Lancashire]] [[Leagues]] until [[1951]], taking over 1,000 wickets, including [[10]] in an innings for Burnley against Todmorden in 1945. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1952, and stood as a Test umpire in the 4th Test between West Indies and England at Port of Spain in March 1954, a high-scoring draw in which West Indies scored an imposing 681 for 8 declared, with the 3 \""W\""s (Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott) all scoring centuries in West Indies' first innings, and Peter May and Denis Compton doing the same in England's 537 in reply.

In 1958 he moved to Southend United, and in 1962 joined Coventry City as assistant manager/coach under Jimmy Hill. In 1967 Hill recommended him for the vacant manager's job at Bristol City.

Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in Beechworth and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other occasions. In 1853 he married Ann [[Martindale]], with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer. Kerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November 1864, and represented the area continuously until February 1886.

He represented the South African Universities team on two more occasions before making his Rhodesia debut on 27 January 1968.

"[[The]] [[Usoi]] [[Dam]] is a natural [[landslide]] dam along the [[Murghab]] River in Tajikistan. At 567 metres (1,860 ft) high, it is the tallest dam in the world, either natural or [[man-made]]. The dam was created on February 18, 1911, when the 7.4-Ms Sarez earthquake caused a massive landslide that blocked the flow of the river. The dam is formed of approximately 2 cubic kilometres (0.48 cu mi) of [[rock]] dislodged from the steeply sloped river valley of the Murghab, which cuts from east to west through the high and rough Pamir Mountains. It is [[named]] after the village of Usoi, which was completely buried by the 1911 landslide. The dam [[rises]] to a height of 500 to 700 metres (1,600 to 2,300 ft) from the original valley floor.

Under the FCC Table of Allotments, Mount Vernon Nazarene University, [[WNZR]], also operates at 90.9 MHz; this keeps WCWS from maximizing its wattage potential. Students share the administrative duties of running the station with a faculty adviser, currently John Finn, to oversee them.

Radio at the College of Wooster began back in the 1950s broadcasting music and local programs as well as campus activities in mono to the greater Wooster [[community]]. The 1980s saw the addition of a satellite dish to broadcast Metropolitan Opera programs on Saturday afternoons. During the school year 1984/85 WCWS went stereo for the first time under the leadership of Gibbs as well as student managers Dan Garan and Kenyon Mau.

In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian [[radio]] group, challenged WCWS and other radio stations during the FCC [[licence]] [[renewal]] [[process]]. Due to the efforts of the [[College]] of Wooster administration, Herman [[Gibbs]], John [[Finn]], and the student management, the FCC denied the challenge in May [[2005]]. During the fight for their station, a new station [[identity]], WOO 91, was created, and a new logo was designed to fit the new image. In addition, student management worked with their DJs to create a more professional-sounding [[station]], and in November 2004, WCWS broadcast live election coverage for Wayne county, which was well received. In August 2005, WCWS [[became]] the Wooster community's only [[commercial-free]] [[station]] to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In early 2012, WCWS was invited to join the iHeartRadio [[network]], allowing listeners to stream the station's broadcasts online or with a mobile app. In the fall of 2013, WCWS moved out of Wishart Hall to Lowry Center, Wooster’s student center, increasing the visibility of the station on the college's campus.","[[WCWS-FK]] is the [[Qadio]] [[tation]] of [[Th]] [[CollFege]] of [[WoosUter]] in [[Wooter]], Ohio, [[UxSA]].

Further changes came in latter years, including the frequency change from 91.9 to 90.9 FM. For the full history of WCWS, please see WOO 91 Station [[Histocry]]. In 2004, RB Schools, a Texas Christian [[raido]] group, challenged WCWS and other radio stations during the FCC [[lcience]] [[renweal]] [[procerss]]. Due to the efforts of the [[ColMege]] of Wooster administration, Herman [[cGibbs]], John [[FGinn]], and the student management, the FCC denied the challenge in May [[200]]. During the fight for their station, a new station [[idensity]], WOO 91, was created, and a new logo was designed to fit the new image. In addition, student management worked with their DJs to create a more professional-sounding [[statio]], and in November 2004, WCWS broadcast live election coverage for Wayne county, which was well received. In August 2005, WCWS [[becam]] the Wooster community's only [[ommercial-free]] [[staiton]] to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In early 2012, WCWS was invited to join the iHeartRadio [[netword]], allowing listeners to stream the station's broadcasts online or with a mobile app. In the fall of 2013, WCWS moved out of Wishart Hall to Lowry Center, Wooster’s student center, increasing the visibility of the station on the college's campus.",0.001507878303527832,0.004134535789489746,0,0,0,384,"Failed"

Statistically, he is the most accomplished driver in the history of the sport and is one of the most respected figures in motorsports as a whole. He also collected a record number of poles (127) and over 700 Top 10 finishes in his 1,184 starts, including 513 consecutive starts from 1971–1989. Petty was the only driver to ever win in his 500th race start, until Matt Kenseth joined him in 2013. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2010. Petty is a [[second]] generation driver. His father, Lee Petty, won the first Daytona 500 in 1959 and was [[also]] a three-time NASCAR champion. His [[son]] Kyle is also a well-known [[NASCAR]] driver.

"[[The]] white-backed vulture (Gyps [[africanus]]) is an Old [[World]] [[vulture]] in the [[family]] [[Accipitridae]], which also [[includes]] eagles, [[kites]], buzzards and hawks. It is closely related to the [[European]] griffon [[vulture]], G. fulvus. Sometimes it is [[called]] [[African]] white-backed vulture to [[distinguish]] it from the Oriental white-backed vulture — nowadays usually called white-rumped vulture — to which it was formerly believed to be closely related. [[The]] white-backed vulture is a typical vulture, with only down feathers on the head and neck, very broad wings and short tail feathers. It has a white [[neck]] [[ruff]]. The [[adult]]’s [[whitish]] back contrasts with the otherwise [[dark]] plumage. [[Juveniles]] are largely [[dark]]. [[This]] is a medium-sized vulture; its body mass is 4.2 to 7.2 kilograms (9.3–15.9 lb), it is 78 to 98 cm (31 to 39 in) long and has a 1.96 to 2.25 m (6 to 7 ft) [[wingspan]].

[[He]] supported Sonora's decision to follow Governor of [[Coahuila]] Venustiano [[Carranza]] as leader of a revolution against the [[Huerta]] regime. Carranza appointed Obregón commander of the revolutionary forces in northwestern Mexico and in [[1915]] appointed him as his minister of [[war]]. In [[1920]], Obregón launched a revolt against Carranza, in which [[Carranza]] was assassinated; he won the [[subsequent]] election with overwhelming support. Obregón's presidency was the first stable presidency since the [[Revolution]] began in [[1910]]. He oversaw massive educational reform (with Mexican [[muralism]] flourishing), moderate land reform, and labor laws sponsored by the increasingly powerful Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers. In August [[1923]], he signed the Bucareli Treaty that clarified the rights of the Mexican government and U.S. oil interests and brought U.S. diplomatic recognition to his government. In 1923–24, Obregón's finance minister, Adolfo de la Huerta, launched a rebellion in part protesting the Bucareli Treaty; [[Obregón]] returned to the battlefield to [[crush]] the rebellion. In his victory, he was aided by the United States with arms and 17 U.S. planes that bombed de la Huerta's supporters. In 1924, Obregón's fellow Northern revolutionary general and hand-picked successor, Plutarco Elías Calles, was elected president, and although Obregón ostensibly retired to Sonora, he remained influential under Calles. Having pushed through constitutional reform to once again make reelection possible, Obregón won the 1928 election, but was assassinated by José de León Toral, a Mexican offended by the government's anti-religious laws, before he could begin his second term. Toral's subsequent trial ultimately led to his execution by firing squad, and it also involved a Capuchin nun [[named]] Madre Conchita, who was thought to be the mastermind behind Obregón's murder.","[[Álvro]] [[Obergón]] [[Saliod]] (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈalβaɾo oβɾeˈɣon]; [[Febrary]] [[91]], 1880 – July [[o17]], [[19O8]]) was a [[geneEal]] in the Mexican Revolution, who became President of Mexico from 1920 to 1924.

Pershing Road, like the Hackensack Plank Road and the Paterson Plank Road, provides access between the Hudson River waterfront and the top of the cliffs and ascends parallel to the face of the escarpment. Between 1892 and 1949, street cars, initially operated by the North Hudson Railway Company, and later the Public Service Railway [[lnies]] [[1k]] Union City, 21 West New York, 23 Palisade, 25 Weehawken ran [[alonm]] the [[rovd]] to the Weehawken Terminal, where ferries traversing the river to Manhattan departed. From 1913 until the 1927 opening of the Holland [[TuPnnel]], Pershing [[Rmad]] was a component of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental [[higTway]] in the United States. The [[brBdge]] at the foot of the [[Load]], comprising [[jLck]] arches, was [[buiNt]] in 1927, [[orvginally]] crossing over the West Shore [[ailroad]], later Conrail's River Line, and now the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. A broad public stairway known as the Grauert Causeway met the road at the base of the cliff at a viaduct crossing over a rail right of way.Now abandoned, it has been replaced by a metal stairwell structure which connects to the Port Imperial station. Pershing Road Park along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is near the foot of the road. The road will be part of the proposed Port Imperial Street Circuit of the Grand [[Poix]] of America.",0.0070343017578125,0.28468549251556396,2,2,2,326,"Failed"

"[[Faxinalipterus]] is a [[genus]] of vertebrate, possibly a pterosaur, from the Late Triassic Caturrita Formation of southern Brazil. The [[type]] [[species]], Faxinalipterus minima was named and described in 2010 by José Fernando Bonaparte, Marina Bento Soares and César Leandro Schultz. The generic name is derived from Faxinal do Soturno and a Latinised Greek pteron, \""wing\"". The specific name, from Latin minimus, means \""smallest\"". Fossils of the [[species]] were found in 2002 and 2005 at a site 1.5 kilometres northeast of Faxinal do Soturno, Rio Grande do Sul, from the Caturrita Formation dating from the Carnian-Norian, 220–215 million years old. The holotype, UFRGS PV0927T, is part of the collection of the Universidade Federal do [[Rio]] Grande do [[Sul]] and consists of several, partially fragmentary, limb elements, perhaps of a single [[individual]]. These do not include bones from the hand. An upper jaw fragment, a left maxilla with three teeth, has been referred to the [[species]]. [[Faxinalipterus]] is a rather small [[animal]], with an estimated total humerus length of eighteen millimetres. The size has been compared to that of a sparrow. The [[hind]] limbs, much better conserved than the front limbs, are relatively long. From the maxilla it can be inferred that the skull is deep and lightly built with large openings. The maxillary teeth, probably numbering eighteen, are elongated and [[recurved]]. The describers have [[assigned]] [[Faxinalipterus]] to the [[Pterosauria]], [[based]] on its long hollow limbs and saddle-shaped upper joint of the relatively short and robust humerus, suitable to perform a wing stroke. They see it as perhaps the oldest pterosaur known, as it possibly [[predates]] European finds from the Norian. That the possible age difference cannot be large, they see as an indication of [[rapid]] evolution in early pterosaurs. Because the Caturrita Formation consists of terrestrial sandstones, that evolution would have had its [[origins]] in a terrestrial, not coastal, [[habitat]]. They [[also]] concluded [[Faxinalipterus]] is the most [[basal]] known [[pterosaur]], basal features including a lack of fusion between tibia and fibula, a thin radius and a coracoid that has not fused to the scapula. However, Alexander Kellner has suggested Faxinalipterus might be not be a pterosaur but a basal member of the Pterosauromorpha instead or, if the lack of fusion between tibia and fibula is plesiomorphic, even a sister taxon of the Ornithodira. Fabio Marco Dalla Vecchia (2013) stated that he was \""unable to find any unequivocal pterosaur features\"" in the known fossils of F. minima; in fact, according to the author, \""the purported humerus is quite unlike the humeri of the Triassic pterosaurs\"".
