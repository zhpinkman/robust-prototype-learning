The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal.

The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles. In 1969, the band recorded their only album, Yesterday's Children, which was released on Map City Records. It exemplified the group's development of a psychedelic proto-heavy metal sound, among the earliest of its kind. The album is marked by Croce's high-pitch screeching wails that prefigured those of former AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, and the fuzz-toned double guitar instrumentals played by both Wright and Muscatelli. However, despite its innovative qualities, the album was perhaps released too early to be commercially accessible and failed to chart nationally. The group disbanded soon thereafter. Reinterest in Yesterday's Children resulted in some tracks appearing on the History of Garage Bands in Connecticut compilation album in 1995. In 2004, Akarma Records released a remastered version of Yesterday's Children, which music critic Dean McFarlane described as a \""stunning object to behold and an audiophile remaster of this underground classic\"". As a result of its distribution, the album has received more recognition for the early progressive music by Yesterday's Children. Another reflection of the album on the Sputnikmusic website boasts it is a \""forgotten gem\"" and \""Vanilla Fudge, Cream and the MC5 are often considered as three of the major influences on the future development of hard rock and metal. This obscure little band from Connecticut show, however, that these glory boys weren't the only ones trying to build upon their blues and psychedelic influences and attempt to deliver something distinctly harder edged\"".",0.9460628628730774,0.9460628628730774,1,1,0,1,"Skipped"

"(148209) 2000 CR105, also written as (148209) 2000 CR105, is the tenth-most-distant known [[object]] in the Solar [[System]] as of 2015. [[Considered]] a [[detached]] object, it orbits the Sun in a [[highly]] [[eccentric]] [[orbit]] every 3305 [[years]] at an [[average]] distance of 222 [[astronomical]] [[units]] (AU). Mike Brown's [[website]] [[lists]] it as a possible dwarf planet with a diameter of 328 [[kilometres]] (204 mi) [[based]] on an [[assumed]] albedo of 0.04. The albedo is [[expected]] to [[be]] low [[because]] the object has a [[blue]] (neutral) [[color]]. However, if the albedo is higher, the [[object]] could [[easily]] [[be]] half that [[size]]. (148209) 2000 CR105 and Sedna [[differ]] from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational influence of the planet Neptune even at their perihelion distances (closest approaches to the Sun). [[It]] is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been put [[forward]]: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a [[passing]] star. \n*  They were pulled from their original [[positions]] by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered (albeit unlikely), [[giant]] [[planet]]. \n*  They were pulled from their original [[positions]] by an undiscovered [[companion]] star [[orbiting]] the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a [[star]] like the Sun had an [[early]] close encounter and a 1% probability that [[outer]] [[planetary]] exchanges would have happened. (148209) 2000 CR105 is [[estimated]] to be 2–3 times more likely to be a captured [[planetary]] object than Sedna.

"Weyerbacher [[Brewing]] [[Company]] is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The brewery is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm. The hops were used for flavoring, not to impart the signature bitterness in the beer.
