One of the [[largest]] towns in the UK, Northampton had a population of [[212]],100 in the 2011 [[census]]. Archaeological evidence of settlement in the [[area]] dates back to the [[Bronze]] Age, [[Roman]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] periods.

Medieval [[Northampton]] had [[many]] churches, [[monasteries]] and the [[University]] of Northampton, which were all enclosed by the town [[walls]]. It was [[granted]] its first town charter by [[King]] Richard [[I]] in 1189 and its first mayor was appointed by [[King]] [[John]] in [[1215]]. The town is also the site of [[two]] medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in [[1460]]. Northampton's royal [[connection]] languished in the [[modern]] [[period]]; the town [[supported]] Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English [[Civil]] War, which culminated in [[King]] [[Charles]] [[II]] ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the [[castle]]. [[The]] [[town]] also [[suffered]] the Great Fire of [[Northampton]] (1675) which destroyed most of the town.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock [[band]] [[formed]] in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"[[The]] Nedbank Golf [[Challenge]], previously known as the [[Million]] Dollar [[Challenge]], is an [[annual]] men's professional [[golf]] [[tournament]] played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an [[official]] money [[event]] for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013.

"[[3043]] [[San]] [[Diego]], provisional [[designation]] 1982 [[SA]], is a [[stony]] Hungaria [[asteroid]] and slow [[rotator]] from the [[inner]] regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, [[approximately]] 4.7 [[kilometers]] in [[diameter]]. It was [[discovered]] by [[American]] [[female]] [[astronomer]] Eleanor [[Helin]] on 30 [[September]] 1982, at the [[U]].S. [[Palomar]] Observatory in California. [[The]] bright [[E-type]] asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the [[innermost]] [[dense]] concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. [[The]] [[asteroid]] orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 [[months]] (977 [[days]]). [[Its]] orbit has an [[eccentricity]] of [[0]].11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. The first [[observation]] was [[taken]] at Crimea‚Äì[[Nauchnij]] in 1974, [[extending]] the asteroid's observation [[arc]] by 8 years prior to its [[discovery]]. [[In]] March 2005, a rotational [[light-curve]] for this [[asteroid]] was obtained from photometric [[observations]] by [[U]].[[S]]. [[astronomer]] [[Brian]] D. Warner at his [[Palmer]] Divide [[Observatory]] (PDO), [[Colorado]]. It [[gave]] a [[long]] rotation [[period]] of [[105]].7¬±[[0]].1 hours with a brightness [[variation]] of 0.60 in [[magnitude]] ([[U]]=3-). The period was derived from a [[re-examined]] [[light-curve]] that originally [[gave]] a [[much]] shorter period of 30.72¬±0.02 hours with an [[amplitude]] of 0.[[37]] in [[magnitude]] ([[U]]=[[0]]). [[This]] [[previously]] published period was only preliminary and is now [[considered]] wrong [[upon]] re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of [[NASA's]] Wide-field [[Infrared]] Survey [[Explorer]], the [[asteroid]] [[measures]] 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[albedo]] of 0.28, while the [[Collaborative]] [[Asteroid]] [[Lightcurve]] Link  assumes an [[albedo]] of 0.30 ‚Äì a compromise [[value]] between [[0]].4 and 0.2, corresponding to the [[Hungaria]] asteroids as [[family]] and orbital [[group]], respectively ‚Äì and [[calculates]] a [[diameter]] of 4.6 kilometers, [[based]] on an [[absolute]] [[magnitude]] of 13.7. [[The]] minor planet was named for the city of [[San]] Diego, California, in appreciation of the [[city]] council's efforts to [[reduce]] the local [[light]] pollution (see [[dark-sky]] [[movement]]).

It was [[detected]] by [[Americans]] [[females]] [[astronomical]] Eleanor [[Hel]] [[in]] on 30 [[Sept]] 1982, at the [[or]].S. [[Foothill]] Observatory in California. [[To]] bright [[E-ype]] asteroid is a member of the Hungaria family, which form the [[darkest]] [[intense]] concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. [[To]] [[meteors]] orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 [[month]] (977 [[time]]). [[Is]] orbit has an [[compensate]] of [[O]].11 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the [[e]] [[cliptic]]. The first [[observing]] was [[took]] at Crimea‚Äì[[Naucnij]] in 1974, [[extening]] the asteroid's observation [[arcs]] by 8 years prior to its [[detecting]]. [[Throughout]] March 2005, a rotational [[lighùöù-curve]] for this [[meteor]] was obtained from photometric [[sightings]] by [[or]].[[with]]. [[astronomical]] [[Bria’∏]] D. Warner at his [[Harrington]] Divide [[Watch]] (PDO), [[Denver]]. It [[delivered]] a [[lang]] rotation [[deadline]] of [[15]].7¬±[[O]].1 hours with a brightness [[va‚≤Öiation]] of 0.60 in [[magniùöùude]] ([[yeo]]=3-). The period was derived from a [[‚≤Öe-examined]] [[light-c’Ωrve]] that originally [[delivered]] a [[highly]] shorter period of 30.72¬±0.02 hours with an [[scale]] of 0.[[3ùüï]] in [[vastness]] ([[wu]]=[[O]]). [[Such]] [[beforehand]] published period was only preliminary and is now [[consi‘Åered]] wrong [[afterward]] re-examination.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste. In September 2008, Weyerbacher released a limited run of a seasonal India pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

However, Cameron's time in the Senate was brief, for an election for the [[vacancy]] was held to coincide with the 1969 [[Federal]] Election in October and he was [[defeated]] by Labor's Don Cameron (no relation). [[Cameron]] [[entered]] South Australia's [[Legislative]] Council in [[1971]] [[following]] the retirement of [[Sir]] [[Norman]] Jude. He [[became]] an important [[ally]] of Steele [[Hall]] (now Leader of the Opposition), [[representing]] the increasingly [[visible]] [[moderate]] forces [[within]] the [[party]]. [[Cameron]] often opposed his [[fellow]] [[LCL]] [[Legislative]] Councillors, due to his support for Universal Suffrage for that [[chamber]].

[[However]] the Liberal [[Movement]] was vastly outpolled by the LCL ([[renamed]] the Liberal [[Party]] of [[Australia]] in 1974), and there was a [[push]] from within both [[parties]] for reunification.

[[Howev–µr]] the Liberal [[Moving]] was vastly outpolled by the LCL ([[re’∏amed]] the Liberal [[Fiesta]] of [[Australians]] in 1974), and there was a [[momentum]] from within both [[portions]] for reunification.

"[[Steven]] [[Lynn]] \""[[Steve]]\"" [[Beshear]] ([[born]] [[September]] 21, [[1944]]) is an [[American]] [[attorney]] and [[Democratic]] [[Party]] [[politician]] who was the [[61st]] Governor of Kentucky from 2007 to 2015. He served in the [[Kentucky]] House of Representatives from 1974 to 1979, was the [[state's]] [[Attorney]] General from 1980 to 1983, and was the [[49th]] [[Lieutenant]] Governor from 1983 to [[1987]].

[[He]] parlayed that reputation into a term as [[attorney]] [[general]], serving under [[Governor]] [[John]] [[Y]].

"Federal elections were [[held]] in Germany on 20 May 1928. [[The]] Social Democratic Party (SPD) remained the largest party in the Reichstag after winning 153 of the 491 seats.

Following his appointment, M√ºller, who had already been Germany's Chancellor for 4 months in 1920, created a Grand Coalition of members of the SPD, German Democratic Party, Centre Party and the German People's Party. The coalition though, was plagued by internal divisions right from the beginning, with each party more concerned with their self-interest than the interest of the government and eventually M√ºller asked President Paul Von Hindenburg for emergency powers.

He has had foreseeing dreams ever since he was a young child, and the dreams he has always come true. As he grows older and enters junior high, he has fewer foreseeing dreams and they also become weaker. However, one night when he is in junior high, he has the strongest foreseeing dream he has ever had. This dream reveals that he will someday realize he is gay, since he is having sex with a man in his dream.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam band. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place. The album contains a mixture of traditional gospel songs (played with instrumental arrangements) and original instrumentals written by the group. The group toured in 2002 and then reunited to tour again in late 2007/early 2008. The group also played at the Bonnaroo festival in 2005 and 2012, and on the Jam Cruise in 2010.

"Turkey, whose relations with Syria had been friendly over the previous decade, condemned its President Bashar Assad over the violent crackdown on protests in 2011 and requested his departure from office. Previously, after 1999 when Bashar Assad's father Hafez al-Assad expelled Kurdish leader Abdullah √ñcalan, the relationship between Syria and Turkey warmed. In the beginning of the Syrian Civil War, Turkey trained defectors of the Syrian Army on its territory, and in July 2011, a group of them announced the birth of the Free Syrian Army, under the supervision of Turkish intelligence. In October 2011, Turkey began sheltering the Free Syrian Army, offering the group a safe zone and a base of operations.

"Ethno [[Jazz]], a [[form]] of [[Ethno]] Music, is [[sometimes]] [[equaled]] to [[World]] Music or is regarded as its [[successor]], particularly before the [[1990s]].

"WCNH is a [[radio]] [[station]] airing a Classical music format, licensed to Bow, New Hampshire, [[broadcasting]] on 91.5 MHz FM. The [[station]] serves the Concord, New Hampshire area, and is owned by New Hampshire Public Radio, Incorporated. WCNH operates at only 190 watts due to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in New England. Its coverage area is effectively limited to Concord and surrounding areas of Merrimack County. To make up for the shortfall in coverage, it is simulcast on sister station WEVO's second HD channel. In 2000, Highland Community Broadcasting was created after New Hampshire Public Radio dropped all classical music programming. The group incorporated as a non-profit and applied for a low-power FM license in August 2000. In July 2003 the FCC granted a license to Highland, for 94.7 in Concord.

The [[terminal]] serves the Concord, New Hampshire area, and is owned by New Hampshire Public Radio, Incorporated. WCNH operates at only 190 watts due to the crowded state of the noncommercial end of the FM dial in New England. Its coverage area is effectively limited to Concord and surrounding areas of Merrimack County. To make up for the shortfall in coverage, it is simulcast on sister station WEVO's second HD channel. In 2000, Highland Community Broadcasting was created after New Hampshire Public Radio dropped all classical music programming. The group incorporated as a non-profit and applied for a low-power FM license in August 2000. In July 2003 the FCC granted a license to Highland, for 94.7 in Concord.
