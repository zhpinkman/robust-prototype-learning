All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham.

"Russells [[Hall]] Hospital is an NHS general hospital [[located]] in [[Dudley]], West [[Midlands]], [[England]], run by The [[Dudley]] [[Group]] NHS [[Foundation]] [[Trust]].

The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished.

"Naga the [[Serpent]] (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[fictional]] [[character]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990. She is also often known as Naga the White Serpent, which is a more literal translation from Japanese (白蛇JP, lit. \""white snake\""), and an early English version by A.D. Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.","Naga the [[Rattlesnake]] (白蛇のナーガ Sāpento no Nāga) is a [[mannequin]] [[idiosyncrasies]] in the light novel, anime, manga, radio drama and game versions of Hajime Kanzaka's media franchise Slayers, who was introduced in Dragon Magazine in 1990.

Vision had her name transliterated as \""Nahga\"". The name she is best known by is in reality an alias of Princess Gracia Ul Naga Saillune (Japanese: グレイシア＝ウル＝ナーガ＝セイルーン Gureishia Uru Nāga Seirūn). The character has great magical powers and an unstable but resilient personality. She is particularly obsessed with a fellow wandering sorceress and the central character of Slayers, Lina Inverse. While occasionally referred to as Lina's sidekick and traveling partner, Naga's arrogance and self-imagined rivalry made her just as likely to antagonize Lina during the course of any story. Naga is a few years older than Lina and takes great pride in her much more voluptuous appearance, but like her she has many character flaws, often played for comedic purposes. She was well received by anime critics and general audience alike. Naga's Japanese voice actress is Maria Kawamura, and her English voice actresses are Kelly Manison in the OVAs and movies. In the anime series Slayers Evolution-R, Naga appears as a cameo character named Nama (ナーマ), voiced by Kawamura in Japanese and by Eva Kaminsky in English.",0.009687185287475586,0.7066975831985474,0,3,0,256,"Successful"

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

"John Daniel Lavelle ([[September]] 9, 1916 – July 10, 1979) was a [[United]] [[States]] [[Air]] [[Force]] [[general]] and [[commander]] of [[Seventh]] [[Air]] [[Force]], with [[headquarters]] at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Republic of Vietnam. Lavelle was removed from his position in 1972 and [[forced]] to [[retire]] due to alleged misconduct over bombing missions during the [[Vietnam]] War while serving as the [[Seventh]] [[Air]] [[Force]] commander. [[Since]] the ranks of [[general]] and [[lieutenant]] [[general]] are [[temporary]] and [[linked]] to their [[corresponding]] [[position]] of [[assignment]], federal law requires [[senatorial]] approval for an [[officer]] to retire at these higher ranks. [[Due]] to these allegations the Senate refused to confirm Lavelle's retirement as a four-star or three-star general. Lavelle was reverted and [[retired]] at his permanent two-star rank of [[major]] [[general]]. On [[August]] 4, 2010, [[President]] Barack Obama nominated Lavelle posthumously for promotion back to the grade of general on the Air Force retired list in light of the release of declassified information that showed that Lavelle had been authorized by President Richard Nixon to conduct the bombing missions. Further, the Air Force Board for [[Correction]] of Military Records found no evidence Lavelle [[caused]], either directly or indirectly, the falsification of records, or that he was even [[aware]] of their existence. Once he learned of the reports, Lavelle took action to ensure the practice was discontinued.

"3043 [[San]] [[Diego]], provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the [[asteroid]] belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

He restored and improved the buildings, including [[constructing]] a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were [[standardized]], and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their [[own]] houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer [[alignment]] with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm continued in his office almost [[constantly]] for twenty-four [[years]], [[barring]] a period of a [[few]] [[years]] when he was a hermit. [[After]] that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand [[Chartreuse]], and helped [[defend]] the sitting Pope Alexander III against the antipope Victor IV.
