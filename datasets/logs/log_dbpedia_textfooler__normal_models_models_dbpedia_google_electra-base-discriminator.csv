St. Gabriel's was consecrated on May 28, 1893 by Michael Corrigan, then the Archbishop of New York. The buildings of the parish are distinctly Norman-English in design. The church was built of blue granite and limestone with a steeply pitched red tile roof, and two towers with a clock and chimes. The [[adjacent]] rectory [[house]] was built in a corresponding style.The interior features salmon colored brick walls, arched hardwood [[paneled]] ceilings and mosaic floors. The decoration of the chancel walls is in old gold and is a near perfect reproduction of the chancel of the San Marco Cathedral in Venice. The three chancel windows were designed by Franz Mayer & Co. and represent \""the Saviour\"", \""St. Francis de Sales\"" and \""St. Margaret of Scotland\"". The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's [[features]] 17 [[impressive]] stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Tiffany windows include \""The Education Of The Virgin\"", \""The Annunciation\"", \""The Marriage Of Joseph And Mary\"" and \""The Baptism of Jesus\"". The complete set of memorial windows were gifts of the seven Iselin children in honor of their mother. At the time of its construction, St. Gabriel's was one of the most costly houses of [[worship]] in the region.

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar).

A [[canal]] of [[approximately]] 400 meters' [[length]] was [[built]], also in the 1920s, to [[divert]] the Velino river from its existing natural course into the lake. The [[purpose]] of this [[work]] was to [[improve]] [[hydroelectric]] [[power]] [[production]]. [[At]] one [[time]] the [[lake]] was [[part]] of a [[much]] [[larger]] lake, [[known]] from Roman times as \""Lagus Velinus\"" or Lake Velino. Lake Piediluco was [[formed]] as a [[result]] of [[cuts]] [[downstream]] from the [[lake]] that [[drained]] the [[waters]] of [[Lake]] Velino into the [[lower]] Nera River, which also [[created]] the Cascata [[delle]] Marmore [[waterfall]]. Lake Piediluco is the [[site]] of the Italian National Rowing [[Center]], which [[hosts]] [[many]] training and competition [[events]] at the national, European, and [[international]] [[level]]. [[The]] [[lake]] is [[ideal]] for the [[sport]] due to its [[shape]], [[central]] geographical [[location]], and the [[relatively]] [[calm]] [[winds]]. \n* The [[lake]] from Labro \n* [[Sunset]] on the [[lake]] \n* [[Lake]] [[map]]","[[Lk]] [[rai]] Piediluco is a [[lk]] that straddles the [[borderline]] between the [[Boycotting]] of [[Udine]], Umbria, [[Milano]] and the [[Boycotting]] of Rieti, [[Juventus]].

The [[lakeshore]] is [[introduced]] by the inflow of water from three [[causes]]: the Rio Fuscello, the Velino river and the Nera [[rivers]]. The [[movement]] from the Rio Fuscello is [[definitely]] [[stemming]], while the [[currents]] from the Nera and Velino rivers are [[all]] [[affected]] in some [[chapters]] due to man-made means.

"3043 [[San]] [[Diego]], [[provisional]] [[designation]] 1982 [[SA]], is a stony Hungaria asteroid and [[slow]] [[rotator]] from the [[inner]] [[regions]] of the [[asteroid]] belt, [[approximately]] 4.7 [[kilometers]] in diameter.

However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste.

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, [[founded]] in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback. The [[brewery]] is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a [[pioneer]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy.

The [[brasserie]] is well known for its \""huge taste\"" beers. Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume. Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a [[forerunner]] of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy.

In 2008, rumors began to circulate about a new season in 2010–2011, however these rumors could neither be confirmed nor denied by Alltel, Verizon, and others.

"The Word is an American instrumental/sacred steel/gospel blues jam [[band]]. The supergroup includes well-known musicians: Robert Randolph (pedal steel guitar), John Medeski (keyboards), both members of North Mississippi Allstars- Luther Dickinson (electric guitar), Cody Dickinson (drums, washboard), and ex-North Mississippi Allstars bassist Chris Chew. The Word developed from a mutual affection for gospel music and the Sacred Steel tradition shared by Medeski and members of the North Mississippi Allstars, both having discovered the phenomenon through a series of albums published by Arhoolie Records in the 1990s and early 2000s. Chris Chew and Luther Dickinson were particularly fond of a song called \""Without God\"" on the Sacred Steel Live! album, the only track credited to a then-unknown Robert Randolph. They contacted Randolph and recruited him to form their own Sacred Steel band, likely the first initiated by musicians outside the House of God church organization. Musically, The Word is similar to other sacred steel bands, with the major difference being a total lack of vocals, both gospel singing and sing-song preaching that often accompanies such music in the original church setting. The organ and electric piano content, provided by Medeski, is more experimental and pronounced than in traditional sacred steel music, which originally developed from House of God churches filling the role of a pipe organ with the much less expensive steel guitar. Another unusual aspect of the music is that drummer Cody Dickinson plays electric washboard on certain songs, as he sometimes does with the North Mississippi Allstars. During live concerts, there is typically only one vocal microphone, used by Randolph to address the audience with encouragement and occasional exclamations of spiritual praise between songs. However, there is at least one example of bassist Chris Chew singing the lyrics to a traditional gospel song played by The Word, on January 1, 2010 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Their debut self-titled album, produced by Medeski and released on Ropeadope Records July 31, 2001, includes an updated version of \""Without God\"", the song that brought The Word together in the first place.

The [[engagement]] was inconclusive and is most [[notable]] for the [[sinking]] of the English carrack Mary Rose. In 1545, Francis launched an invasion of England with 30,000 soldiers in more than 200 ships. Against this armada — larger than the Spanish Armada forty-three years later — the English had about 80 ships and 12,000 soldiers. The French expedition started disastrously, the flagship Carraquon perishing in an accidental fire at anchor in the Seine on 6 July 1545. Admiral Claude d'Annebault transferred his flag to La Maistresse which then ran aground as the fleet set sail. The leaks were patched and the fleet crossed the Channel.

La Maitresse was on the point of sinking due to the damage she had sustained earlier but although d'Annebault had to change his flagship again she was saved from foundering. On the night of 18 July Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but 35–40 of her crew. The exact reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after [[firing]] at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the French fleet believed that the galleys had sunk her, though this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains.

On the night of 18 July Henry dined aboard Great Harry, the flagship of Admiral John Dudley, Viscount Lisle. The next day was calm, and the French employed their galleys against the immobile English vessels. Toward evening a breeze sprang up and as Mary Rose, the flagship of Vice Admiral George Carew, advanced to battle, she foundered and sank with the loss of all but 35–40 of her crew. The exact reasons for the sinking are not known, but it was believed at the time that the crew had been negligent and forgot to close the lower gunports after [[blasting]] at the galleys, so that when she heeled over in the breeze she took on water and turned over. A witness on board the French fleet believed that the galleys had sunk her, though this is not supported by other contemporary accounts and no physical evidence of this remains. The French troops ashore made no progress and returned to France in August.",0.275706946849823,0.7092382907867432,5,2,5,611,"Successful"

"The [[Battle]] of Niḫriya was the culminating point of the [[hostilities]] between the Hittites and the Assyrians for control over the remnants of the former empire of Mitanni. When Šuppiluliuma I (13th century BCE) conquered Mitanni, he created two provinces (Aleppo and Carchemish), and distributed the large part of territories of this kingdom between his allies. The rest of what had been the empire of Mitanni retained its independence as a Hittite vassal state called Ḫanigalbat. During the reign of the Hittite king Mursili III (better known as Urḫi-Tešub), Ḫanigalbat was conquered by the Assyria Empire and the Assyrians controlled the East bank of the Euphrates. Hence, when Ḫattusili III ousted his nephew Urḫi-Tešub and seized the Hittite throne, he had to be content with the permanent loss of Ḫanigalbat to the Assyrians despite its former status as a Hittite vassal state. (i.e. Ḫattusili faced a fait accompli) The Assyrian involvement in Syria continued under the command of king Sulmanu-ašared I and precipitated a crisis with Ḫatti. The Hittites considered Assyrian involvement to be a clear attack on the frontiers of their empire and went into battle under their king: Tudḫalia IV, Ḫattusili's son and successor. This led to a major battle which is known today as the Battle of Niḫriya. A letter (RS 34.265) giving details of the campaign and its outcome was sent by Sulmanu-ašared to Ugarit.
