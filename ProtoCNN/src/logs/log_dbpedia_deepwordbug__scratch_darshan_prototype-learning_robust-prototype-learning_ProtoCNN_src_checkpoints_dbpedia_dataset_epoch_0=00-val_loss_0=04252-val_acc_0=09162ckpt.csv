The intricately carved white marble altar is a memorial to Fannie G. Iselin. St. Paul's features 17 impressive stained-glass windows crafted by Louis Comfort Tiffany Studios, The Gorham Company, Franz Mayer & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne.

"On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season. Arsenal won by a single goal, but the game was best remembered for a brawl between both teams. The Football Association (FA) took the unprecedented step of deducting league points from the two clubs. The only goal of the match came moments before half-time, scored by Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar. In the second half, Limpar was involved in a contest for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin; Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn made a tackle on Irwin that precipitated a melee between both sets of players. All but one of the twenty-two players on the field were involved; it lasted no more than 20 seconds and referee Keith Hackett booked only Limpar and Winterburn for their actions. Manchester United and Arsenal took immediate action by fining a number of their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as they were involved in a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, as they went on to become league champions with just one defeat. As of 2016, it is the only instance in English league football history in which any team has been docked points due to player misconduct. The match is considered to have instigated the rivalry between the two clubs, who competed with each other for silverware regularly through the 1990s and 2000s.","On 20 October 1990, Manchester United Football Club faced Arsenal Football Club in a Football League First Division fixture at Old Trafford, during the 1990–91 season.

"[[Augustus]] George Hazard (April [[28]], [[1802]] – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an [[American]] [[manufacturer]] of gunpowder and the namesake of [[Hazardville]], [[Connecticut]]. Hazard was [[born]] in [[Kingston]], [[Rhode]] [[Island]] on April [[28]], [[1802]], a [[son]] of [[Thomas]] and [[Silence]] Knowles [[Hazard]]. His family moved to Connecticut when he was six years old. As a young man, he worked as a merchant in Savannah, Georgia. In 1827 he relocated to New York City, where he was a commission agent engaged in the [[sale]] of gunpowder and other products. In 1837 he bought into a gunpowder production company that had been established two years earlier on the Scantic River in the town of Enfield, Connecticut. He assumed sole ownership of the company in 1843. The business was known thereafter as the Hazard Powder Company and the village that supported it became known as Hazardville. During the early years of the Civil War, Col. Hazard was under suspicion by the federal government as being sympathetic to the Southern Cause. It was well known that he was a good friend of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and that he lived in the South and had developed many business relationships. Shortly before South Carolina seceded from the Union, it bought 80,000 lbs. of powder that was used to propel the first shots fired on Fort Sumter. In fact, much of the powder in the Southern Arsenals at the [[outset]] of the war was manufactured by the Connecticut company. The rapidly increasing demand for powder products compelled Hazard to hurriedly expand their facilities to meet war time production needs. Soon Hazard Powder was supplying the Union Forces with 12,500 lbs of powder a day. The mill at Hazardville was in operation 24 hours a day and produced 40% of all the gunpowder used during the Civil War by the Union. Hazard lived on Enfield Street in Enfield, several miles from the powder mill, and ran the business until his death on May 7, 1868, at the Ascot House in New York City.","[[Auguhstus]] George Hazard (April [[2]], [[180]] – May 7, 1868), known as Colonel Augustus Hazard, was an [[Ameriacn]] [[mUanufacturer]] of gunpowder and the namesake of [[Haardville]], [[Conecticut]].

Except for the 1995-1999 legislature, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) had governed the autonomous community since the first election in 1983. However, in the 2011 election, the Asturias Forum (FAC), a split from the People's Party (PP), won the most seats despite PSOE obtaining more votes. The FAC was established on 19 January 2011 by Francisco Álvarez Cascos, former Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, after failing to be selected as PP's candidate. FAC gains came at the expense of the PP and the PSOE, but while PSOE's collapse had been predicted in early opinion polls, the PP had been widely expected to make strong gains before Cascos' split, instead scoring the worst result of its history. The Asturian Bloc (BA) had terminated its coalition with United Left (IU) and the Asturian Greens (LVA) in August 2010 and run separately, failing to win any seats. IU and the Greens maintained their coalition and retained their existing four seats. Vicente Álvarez Areces, incumbent since 1999, did not seek re-election. As in Asturias it is not allowed for parties to vote against a proposed presidential candidate (instead being forced to either abstain or vote a candidate of their own), on July 2011, the PSOE and PP announced that they would abstain in the investiture voting of Álvarez Cascos, who thus became the new President at the head of a minority administration. The resulting government, however, was not able to gather legislative support to approve its 2012 regional budget, with both PP and PSOE blocking the vote, resulting in a fresh election being held in March 2012.","The 2011 Asturian parliamentary election was [[helV]] on Sunday, 22 May 2011, to elect the 8th General Junta of the Principality of Asturias, the regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Asturias.

"Ox Tales, also known as The Tales of Boes' Gang (げらげらブース物語 Geragera Būsu Monogatari), is an animated television series produced by Telecable Benelux B.V. and Cosmos Studio in association with Saban Entertainment. It was a co-production between Japan and the Netherlands based on a Dutch comic strip Boes created by Wil Raymakers and Thijs Wilms. The series ran on the Japanese network TV Tokyo from April 7, 1987–March 29, 1988. It consists of 102 15-minute episodes, which were usually transmitted as 51 half-hour shows of two episodes each.

"The Raid on Griessie was a British attack on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars. The raid was the final action in a series of engagements fought by the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean against the Dutch naval forces in Java, and it completed the destruction of the Dutch squadron with the scuttling of three ships of the line, the last Dutch warships in the region. The British squadron—under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Pellew—sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. In the summer of 1806, British frigates reconnoitred Javan waters and captured two Dutch frigates, encouraging Pellew to lead a major attack on Batavia that destroyed the last Dutch frigate and several smaller warships. Prior to the Batavia raid however, Dutch Rear-Admiral Hartsinck had ordered his ships of the line to sail eastwards, where they took shelter at Griessie, near Sourabaya. On the morning of 5 December 1807, a second raiding squadron under Pellew appeared off Griessie and demanded that the Dutch squadron in the harbour surrender. The Dutch commander—Captain Cowell—refused, and seized the boat party that had carried the message. Pellew responded by advancing up the river and exchanging fire with a Dutch gun battery on Madura Island, at which point the governor in Surabaya overruled Captain Cowell, released the seized boat party and agreed to surrender the ships at anchor in Gresik harbour. By the time Pellew reached the anchorage, however, Cowell had scuttled all of the ships in shallow water, and Pellew was only able to set the wreckage on fire. Landing shore parties, the British destroyed all military supplies in the town and demolished the battery on Madura. With the destruction of the force in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated. British forces returned to the region in 1810 with a large scale expeditionary force that successfully invaded and captured Java in 1811, temporary removing the last Dutch colony east of Africa.","The Raid on Griessie was a British attack on the Dutch port of Griessie (later renamed Gresik) on Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars.

"Russells Hall Hospital is an NHS general [[hospital]] located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust. The hospital is situated south-west of the town centre on the A4101 road, which connects to the Kingswinford area of the borough. It was first planned in the 1960s as a general hospital for Dudley and the surrounding area. The first phase of the hospital opened in 1976 as a laundry centre for the borough's hospitals, and the general hospital buildings were built within the next five years, but a shortage of equipment meant that it did not open to patients until March 1984, becoming fully operational in May that year. The new hospital included an accident and emergency unit to replace those at the Guest Hospital in Dudley and the Corbett Hospital in Stourbridge. Around this time, the NHS first began to consider the closure of Dudley Guest Hospital. In 1992, plans were unveiled for Russells Hall to be expanded as part of plans to close Wordsley and Dudley Guest hospitals, as well as parts of the Corbett Hospital. There was much protest against this, and over the next few years there were several amendments to the proposals - including a move which would have seen Wordsley Hospital keep its maternity services but for all other services to relocate to Russells Hall. In April 1998, however, it was decided that Wordsley Hospital would close completely and Corbett and Dudley Guest would be downsized to out-patient services only, with Russells Hall being expanded to include all of the borough's in-patient services. The first phases of the work were completed in 2004 and the expansion was completed during 2005, by which time Russells Hall had doubled in size. Much of the existing hospital was also refurbished. The Princess Royal opened the revamped hospital on 22 February 2006 – 22 years after she had opened the original hospital. In preparation for the completion of the expanded hospital and inevitable rise in traffic, the main road towards Dudley town centre - Kingswinford Road - was widened into a dual carriageway in 2003. The car park was also expanded around the same time - a move which saw several houses along High Street demolished in [[1999]]. Cricketer Ian [[Botham]], famous for his charity work, opened a state of the art leukaemia unit at the hospital in 1998. Pop star and actor Martin Kemp opened the hospital's new [[CT]] scanning suite in January 2006, a decade after he recovered from brain cancer with the help of pioneering treatment. The hospital now has its own bus station, which gives a direct bus link to Dudley town centre, Brierley Hill, Kingswinford, Stourbridge, Tipton, Wednesbury, and Walsall.","Russells Hall Hospital is an NHS general [[Pospital]] located in Dudley, West Midlands, England, run by The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust.

"Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small insectivorous songbirds (\""warblers\""), formerly placed in the Old World warbler \""wastebin\"" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. Its members occur mainly in Asia and Africa, ranging into Oceania and Europe. The monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), tit hylia Pholidornis and green hylia (Hylia) are exclusively found in the forests of Africa. The pseudo-tailorbirds, tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and Abroscopus warblers are mostly found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia, with one species reaching as far north as Japan and Siberia. The genus Cettia has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe across Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Palau. Most of the species in the genus are sedentary, but the Asian stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and Cetti's warbler are partly migratory over much of their range. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush warbler, are altitudinal migrants. The species are small, stubby birds. Most have moderately long to long tails, while the stubtails and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is typically clad in dull plumage, often with a line above the eye. Some, like the monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), are much different in appearance, having areas of bright yellow plumage. Altogether the Cettiidae are a quite variable group containing many aberrant birds that hitherto had been uncomfortably placed with a wide range of unrelated families. The Megaluridae which contain birds which appear very similar to many cettiids are far more uniform by contrast.

As a group, they are probably closest to the Aegithalidae, the long-tailed tits and relatives.","Cettiidae is a newly validated family of small insectivorous songbirds (\""warblers\""), formerly placed in the Old World warbler \""wastebin\"" assemblage. It contains the typical bush warblers (Cettia) and their relatives. As a common name, cettiid warblers is usually used. Its members occur mainly in Asia and Africa, ranging into Oceania and Europe. The monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), tit hylia Pholidornis and green hylia (Hylia) are exclusively found in the forests of Africa. The pseudo-tailorbirds, tesias and stubtails, as well as Tickellia and Abroscopus warblers are mostly found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia, with one species reaching as far north as Japan and Siberia. The genus Cettia has the widest distribution of the family, reaching from Western Europe across Asia to the Pacific islands of Fiji and Palau. Most of the species in the genus are sedentary, but the Asian stubtail is wholly migratory and the Japanese bush warbler and Cetti's warbler are partly migratory over much of their range. A few species, such as the pale-footed bush warbler, are altitudinal migrants. The species are small, stubby birds. Most have moderately long to long tails, while the stubtails and tesias have tiny tails that do not even emerge past their tail retrices. The group is typically clad in dull plumage, often with a line above the eye. Some, like the monarch warblers (Erythrocercus), are much different in appearance, having areas of bright yellow plumage.

It was relocated to the Mackay Marina in 1985 and restored to full working condition, making it the last fully functional kerosene operated lighthouse in the world. At the original location now stands a modern fiberglass tower. The light was first proposed in 1881 and again in 1882. Tenders were called in 1883, and the lighthouse was constructed by W. P. Clark in 1885, a typical Queensland lighthouse built of a hardwood frame clad with galvanized iron plates. The light source and the apparatus were upgraded in 1923 and in 1934 respectively. The cottages were replaced in 1927. The station received electricity in 1950, but the light remained kerosene operated until it was decommissioned in 1985.

The town is also the site of two medieval battles; the Battle of Northampton (1264) and the second in 1460. Northampton's royal connection languished in the modern period; the town supported Parliament (the Roundheads) in the English Civil War, which culminated in King Charles II ordering the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle.

"The Ten Days of Brescia (Italian: Dieci giornate di Brescia) was a revolt which broke out in the northern Italian city of that name, which lasted from March 23 to April 1, 1849. In the early 19th century Brescia was part of the Austrian puppet state called Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The revolt, headed by the patriot Tito Speri, began on the same day as the Battle of Novara (though news of Austria's victory there had not yet reached Brescia). The Austrian troops under general Nugent, were initially surprised and retired to the castle, from which they heavily cannonaded the city, damaging many of Brescia's historical monuments. A total encirclement of Brescia was established by the Austrians beginning on the 8th day of the revolt, when reinforcements arrived. The following day General Haynau, later nicknamed \""The Hyena of Brescia\"", came and demanded the unconditioned surrender of the Bresciani.

"The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an unsuccessful attempt by the Umayyad Caliphate to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea, the capital of the Opsician Theme. Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire's capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the Caliphate had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 727, the Arab army, led by one of the Caliph's sons, penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea. Despite constant attacks for 40 days, the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the Caliphate. The successful repulsion of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy. The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids, as new threats and defeats on their far-flung frontiers diverted Umayyad strength elsewhere, while Byzantine power gradually recovered.","The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an unsuccessful attempt by the Umayyad Caliphate to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea, the capital of the Opsician Theme.

While Tarleton was trapped under his dead horse, men continued killing the Continental soldiers, including men who were not resisting. Little quarter was given to the patriots/rebels.

This provoked numerous actions of the king on their expense and was eventually followed up by attempts of murder. The princes decided to settle this in a battle and it [[ened]] favorably for them thanks to the assistance of Otto I of Brno and his forces, who was married to Euphemia, one of the sisters of Ladislaus and Géza. The injured king fled to Germany soon after the battle and there he aimed to regain the crown with the help of his son-in-law. The outcome of this battle overjoyed all of the nation, since it was regarded as a decisive victory for Hungary's statehood.",0.5951182246208191,0.6417403221130371,5,0,5,121,"Successful"

"Yesterday's Children were an American psychedelic rock band formed in Cheshire-Prospect, Connecticut, outside of New Haven, in 1966. The group's earliest release was the psychedelic rock-influenced single \""To Be or Not to Be\"". Though, at first, Yesterday's Children were a standard garage band, they transitioned into a progressive proto-heavy metal outfit that released one cult classic album in 1969 before disbanding. Formed in 1966, Yesterday's Children featured brothers Denis (lead vocals) and Richard Croce (rhythm guitar), along with Reggie Wright (lead guitar), Ralph Muscatelli (drums), and Chuck Maher (bass guitar). The band took an aggressive garage rock musical stance, while incorporating aspects of psychedelic nuance into their compositions. Later in the year, the group released their debut single, \""To Be or Not to Be\"", on the London Records subsidiary label, Parrot Records, and became a regional success. It is also one of the most rarest and sought after releases by avid record collectors. Over the following three years, Yesterday's Children released two additional singles.

It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006. The story focuses on series protagonist Link, who tries to prevent Hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the Twilight Realm. To do so, he takes the form of both a Hylian and a wolf, and is assisted by a mysterious creature named Midna. The game takes place hundreds of years after Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, in an alternate timeline from The Wind Waker. At the time of its release, Twilight Princess was considered the greatest entry in the Zelda series by many critics, including writers for 1UP.com, Computer and Video Games, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, GamesRadar, IGN, and The Washington Post. It received several Game of the Year awards, and was the most critically acclaimed game of 2006. As of September 2015, 8.85 million copies of the game have been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling title in the series.

"George Elliott [[Hagan]] (May 24, 1916 – December 26, 1990) was an American politician, businessman and farmer and a Democrat. Hagan was born in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the University of Georgia in [[Athens]]. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1939 to [[1944]], [[resigned]] from [[office]] to [[join]] the United States Army as a member of the [[Signal]] Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly [[prevailed]] in the actual popular vote (34,[[318]] to [[33]],629), but under Georgia's [[election]] laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of [[26]] to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the [[general]] [[election]] (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the [[time]] and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a [[month]] after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. Hagan would serve six terms from the 87th United States Congress to the 92nd United States Congress.

Hagan was born in Sylvania, Georgia and attended the University of Georgia in [[AtheRns]]. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1939 to [[19p4]], [[recigned]] from [[oQfice]] to [[jion]] the United States Army as a member of the [[Signla]] Corps for two years. Following the war, he was returned to the House in 1946 and served until his election to the Georgia Senate in 1950 where he served for one term, leaving office in 1953. Hagan served in numerous other state government positions and also worked in the insurance and financial planning industry and several agricultural pursuits. He served on the board of trustees for Tift College. In 1960, Hagan challenged incumbent Congressman Prince H. Preston, Jr., a noted segregationist in the Democratic primary for Georgia's 1st congressional district. Preston narrowly [[prevKiled]] in the actual popular vote (34,[[138]] to [[v33]],629), but under Georgia's [[eelction]] laws, Hagan defeated Preston on \""county unit\"" votes by a margin of [[r6]] to 18 and went on to win unopposed in the [[geSneral]] [[eleZtion]] (the Georgia Republican Party being very weak at the [[tme]] and fielded very few candidates, having not won a race for any congressional race since 1872). Preston would die only a [[moonth]] after the conclusion of his term in early 1973. Hagan would serve six terms from the 87th United States Congress to the 92nd United States Congress.

"Dark Discoveries is an internationally distributed, quarterly slick magazine formerly published by Dark Discoveries Publications, and now published by Journalstone, LLC. It focuses primarily on the horror fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction genres. The magazine's content includes short fiction, interviews, nonfiction articles, profiles of industry notables, and is fully illustrated. Dark Discoveries Publications was originally founded in January, 2004 by James R. Beach of Longview, WA. The magazine began as a black and white periodical with David Emrich, of David Emrich Design, doing the layout and art direction from 2004 to 2007. Together Editor-in-chief Beach and designer Emrich created the basic look and feel of the magazine that continued through the first ten issues. Designer Cesar Puch briefly took over the layout for two issues in 2008, but left for a job with Bad Moon Books after that. Dark Discoveries then became a color publication in 2009 after Jason V Brock became Managing Editor, Graphic Designer (via JaSunni Productions, LLC, who also maintained the Dark Discoveries website) and Art Director in 2008, helping to salvage the magazine from being discontinued by publisher Beach. Among many novel ideas and new perspectives introduced by Brock (editorially, visually, and content-wise) was the concept of having each issue follow a topic to unify its thrust, a more graphically compelling look, and a renewed focus on media outside of the small press, namely film, television, and the art world. Brock left the magazine and the website in mid-2012; his last full issue was #19, which focused on extreme horror, though some of his ideas for topics were utilized into 2013, and he was credited as Art Director for issue #20, as the magazine was transitioned to new staff following Brock's departure to become Editor-in-Chief of the biannual horror literary publication Nameless Digest, published by Cycatrix Press. Dark Discoveries, both the magazine and name, were purchased by JournalStone, LLC. Owner/President Christopher C. Payne in August, 2012. The page count was expanded, the format changed to a perfect-bound magazine, and color was added to all of the pages, the page count was increased, and the format enlarged (all concepts Brock had predicted would be needed to continue the magazine).

"The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf tournament played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa. Originally it was not an official money event for any of the major tours, but it became an official tournament for the Sunshine Tour and European Tour in 2013. Like many high-profile unofficial tournaments in professional golf, it takes place between the conclusion of the PGA Tour in early November, and Christmas. It usually attracts many of the world's highest ranked players. The tournament was a 12-player invitational stroke play event, with the field being made up of defending champion, the Sunshine Tour order of merit winner, the four major winners and then completed with the top players in the Official World Golf Rankings following the U.S. PGA Championship. In 2006, the tournament carried World Rankings points for the first time since 1999. In 2013 it was expanded to 30 players: the defending tournament champion; the top 10 PGA Tour FedEx Cup players, the top 10 European Tour Race to Dubai players; the Sunshine Tour, Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour and PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winners; the Alfred Dunhill Championship winner; and the top 5 South African players in the World Rankings. From 2000 to 2002 the first prize was increased to US$2 million, but the following year the winner's share of the total prize fund was reduced from more than half to around 30%. The standard winner's share on the PGA Tour is 18% and on the European Tour it is 16.67%. In 2006 the winner received $1.2 million out of a total purse of US$4.385 million, so the prize distribution is now not far from the normal pattern for a professional tournament, once allowance is made for the small size of the field. That US$2 million first prize remains the largest in professional golf, but was matched in 2011 by the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters. The 2016 event will be part of the European Tour Final Series, replacing the BMW Masters. Beginning in 2016, the field of 72 will consist mostly of the top (64) available players from the current year Race to Dubai standings. The remainder of the field will consist of the defending champion, prior years winner of the Sunshine Tour order of merit, and tournament invitations. From 2010 to 2012, a separate tournament for senior golfers was held concurrently and called the Nedbank Champions Challenge.","The Nedbank Golf Challenge, previously known as the Million Dollar Challenge, is an annual men's professional golf tournament played at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, North West province, South Africa.

He played college football at Stanford University from 1940 to 1942, returned as head football coach from 1951 to 1957, and served as the school's athletic director from 1963 to 1971. During his coaching tenure at Stanford, Taylor compiled a 40–29–2 record and led the Indians to the 1952 Rose Bowl his first season. That same season, at the age of 31, Taylor was named AFCA Coach of the Year, the youngest recipient of the award ever. As a sophomore, Taylor was one of the \""Wow Boys\"" on the undefeated 1940 Stanford Indians football team and played in Stanford's 1941 Rose [[Bowl]] victory over [[Nebraska]].

"Picea meyeri (Meyer's spruce; Chinese: 白杄; pinyin: báiqiān) is a [[species]] of spruce native to Nei Mongol in the northeast to Gansu in the southwest and also inhabiting Shanxi, Hebei and Shaanxi. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to 30 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 0.8 m. The shoots are yellowish-brown, glabrous or with scattered pubescence. The leaves are needle-like, 13-25 mm long, rhombic in cross-section, bluish-green with conspicuous stomatal lines. The cones are cylindric, 7-11 cm long and 3 cm broad, maturing pale brown 5-7 months after pollination, and have stiff, smoothly rounded scales. It is closely related to the dragon spruce from western China. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree; its popularity is increasing in the eastern United States, where it is being used to replace Blue Spruce, which is more disease-prone in the humid climate there.

C. rynchops is commonly found in mangroves, mudflats, streams, ponds, tidal pools, on algae patches, and has even been found burrowing into the mud. C. rynchops is rear-fanged and is mildly venomous. An aquatic and nocturnal snake, it feeds mainly on fish and is known to consume eels. In captivity, it is observed to move in a sidewinding direction on land. In the BBC series 'Life in Cold Blood' it was filmed adapting this sidewinding technique to jump across a mudflat in Singapore ( up until then no snakes were considered able to truly jump ). It also has a prehensile tail that would suggest it could climb mangrove trees. It is now known to give birth to live young, numbering from 8 to 30, either in water or on land. It is a quite docile, mild-tempered and a hardy snake; in recent years it has become a welcome addition to snake hobbyists in the Philippines. It also owes its popularity to its bright yellow to orange belly coloring, mostly of females.","The New Guinea bockadam or dog-faced water snake, Cerberus rynchops, is a species of a colubrid snake found in coastal waters of Asia and Australia.

He has an impressive collection of tournament victories including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroij 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he enjoyed a most impressive victory, finishing a clear 2 points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his 3rd= finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, he has nevertheless maintained a highly competitive rating and is able to win smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin-Split 2004 and Hotel [[Petra]] (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter [[played]] for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European [[Team]] Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice.","Oleg Mikhailovich [[Romabishin]] ([[bUrn]] [[0]] January 1952 in Lviv) is a [[Ukrainain]] [[chekss]] [[gradmaster]] and former European junior champion.

"Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope. His Flemish name could indicate a connection with the de Douglas or de Moravia families either by kinship or geography, but there is no other direct evidence of this. His origins are not known, but he was almost certainly the Archibald who was Dean of Moray in the years before 1253. In that year he was consecrated as the successor of Simon de Gunby and Radulf of Lincoln as Bishop of Moray. Through what appears to have been a misunderstanding, Bishop Archibald confirmed the election of one Andrew de Dunn as Dean of Moray. However, the Pope had earlier or simultaneously appointed his own candidate, Nicholas de Hedon, based on an earlier reservation of the position. There was litigation at the Papal see, through which Hedon emerged victorious. Bishop Archibald, apparently concerned he had been placed in a state of excommunication, petitioned Pope Alexander IV and was absolved on 22 December 1255. Bishop Archibald, like all Scottish bishops, was summonded to the Second Council of Lyon. A provincial council at Perth in 1273, however, exempted the Bishop of Moray as well as the Bishop of Dunkeld. Bishop Archibald was present at the Convention of Birgham in 1290. At some point during his episcopate, Uilleam, Mormaer of Ross, committed an outrage to the church or lands of Petty, a church belonging to a canon of Archibald's cathedral. In compensation, Uilleam granted the bishop some lands in Cadboll and elsewhere in Ross. The bishop was also involved in a dispute with Uilleam, Mormaer of Mar, which in 1268 resulted in the latter's excommunication. Bishop Archibald built an episcopal residence at Kinneddar, where he resided for much of his episcopate. His episcopate lasted over 45 years, making it one of the longest in medieval Scotland. He died on 9 December 1298.","Archibald (died 1298) was a 13th-century Scottish prelate best known for involvement in a dispute with the Pope.

"The wandering tattler (Tringa incana) (formerly Heteroscelus incanus: Pereira & Baker, 2005; Banks et al., 2006), is a medium-sized wading bird. It is similar in appearance to the closely related gray-tailed tattler, T. brevipes. The tattlers are unique among the species of Tringa for having unpatterned, greyish wings and backs, and a scaly breast pattern extending more or less onto the belly in breeding plumage, in which both also have a rather prominent supercilium. These birds have stocky bodies with gray upperparts, underwings, face and neck and a white belly. They have short dark yellow legs and a dark gray bill. Adults in breeding plumage are heavily barred underneath. In summer, they are found in far-eastern Russia, Alaska, portions of the California coast and northwestern Canada. They nest in rocky areas along mountain streams. At other times, they are found on rocky islands in the southwest Pacific and on rocky Pacific coasts from California to South America and as far as Australia. They feed on aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans and marine worms. During breeding season, they also eat insects. While wading, they forage actively, making jerky bobbing movements.Feeding behaviors can include repeated returns to the same location over short periods of time. They can be seen flying low over a rocky coastline or along a jetty. The female lays 4 olive-colored eggs in a shallow depression.

"3070 Aitken, provisional designation 1949 GK, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 4 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 April 1949, by the U.S. Indiana Asteroid Program of Indiana University at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.8 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,279 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The used first precovery was taken at Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. However, the asteroid was already imaged in 1907, at Taunton in Massachusetts (803). A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations [[made]] at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory in November 2010. The light-curve gave a rotation [[period]] of 6.3965±0.0026 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.38 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 3.9 kilometers. The minor planet was named for of American astronomer Robert Grant Aitken (1864–1951), who was the 4th director of the Lick Observatory from 1930 to 1935, successor of director William Campbell, after whom the minor planet 2751 Campbell was named. Aitken became a well known expert on double stars and, in 1932, published the New General Catalogue of Double Stars Within 120° of the North Pole, He is also known for his book The Binary Stars that was first published in 1918. [[He]] is also honored by the lunar crater Aitken. Naming citation was published on 21 [[April]] 1989 (M.P.C.

"Andrew George [[Silver]] ([[born]] 13 January 1967 in London, England) is a former international motorcycle speedway rider who represented England at test level.

"The Holy Jesus Hospital  is a working office Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in the care of the National Trust. The site of the hospital has been in use for 700 years helping the townspeople. There was an Augustinian friary on the site from the thirteenth century, then an almshouse for housing retired freemen, then a soup kitchen was built next to Almshouse in the nineteenth century, before the site acquired its current function as a working office. The building also serves as the basis of the Inner City Project of the National Trust.

It is replaced in southern Costa Rica by the gray-tailed mountaingem, L. cinereicauda (García-Moreno et al., 2006). Another very close relative, the purple-throated mountaingem, is found sympatrically. This bird is 10.5 cm long. The shortish black bill is slightly curved. The adult male has bronze-green upperparts and underparts except for a brilliant green crown, white throat and blue tail. The female lacks the bright crown and throat, and has rich cinnamon underparts. Young birds resemble the female but have buff fringes to the upperparts plumage. The female white-throated mountaingem is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a deep plant-fibre cup nest m high in a scrub, small tree or vine. Incubation takes 15–19 days, and fledging another 20-26. The food of this species is nectar, taken from a variety of small flowers, including epiphytic Ericaceae.

"Samuel Harvey Shapiro (born Israel Shapiro) (April 25, 1907 – March 16, 1987) was the 34th Governor of Illinois, serving from 1968 to 1969. He was a member of the Democratic Party. [[Born]] in 1907 in the Governorate of Estonia of the Russian Empire, he emigrated to the United States at an early age. He graduated from the University of Illinois College of Law. As a lawyer, Shapiro practiced in Kankakee, Illinois. Turning to public service, he was elected state's attorney (county prosecutor) of Kankakee County in 1936. From 1947-61 he served in the Illinois State House of Representatives, where he took a special interest in mental health issues. Shapiro was elected the 38th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1960 and again in 1964, and took office as governor when the previous governor Otto Kerner, Jr. resigned to accept appointment to the federal appellate court. Shapiro thus became the second Jewish governor of Illinois (Henry Horner being the first). Illinois thereby became the first state to have had two Jewish governors; New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have each since elected at least a second governor of the faith.

"Pandora (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a [[lot]] of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.","Pandora (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner satellite of Saturn.

"3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin on 30 September 1982, at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. The bright E-type asteroid is a [[member]] of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (977 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The first observation was taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1974, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 8 years prior to its discovery. In March 2005, a rotational light-curve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (PDO), Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 105.7±0.1 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 in magnitude (U=3-). The period was derived from a re-examined light-curve that originally gave a much shorter period of 30.72±0.02 hours with an amplitude of 0.37 in magnitude (U=0). This previously published period was only preliminary and is now considered wrong upon re-examination. According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 4.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.28, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link  assumes an albedo of 0.30 – a compromise value between 0.4 and 0.2, corresponding to the Hungaria asteroids as family and orbital group, respectively – and calculates a diameter of 4.6 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 13.7. The minor planet was named for the city of San Diego, California, in appreciation of the city council's efforts to reduce the local light pollution (see dark-sky movement). Palomar mountain is located within San Diego County, California, and the astronomers at the site were concerned that the light pollution from the city would ruin their ability to use the observatory. The council had voted to use Low-Pressure Sodium (LPS) vapor lamps for their street lights. This fixture only emitted light at one wavelength, which astronomers could readily filter out. Naming citation was published on 13 July 1984 (M.P.C. 8914).","3043 San Diego, provisional designation 1982 SA, is a stony Hungaria asteroid and slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 4.7 kilometers in diameter.

"The 1991 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship was the 46th edition of the U.S. Women's Open, held July 11–14 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. Meg Mallon shot a final round 67 (−4) to finish at 283 (−1), two strokes ahead of runner-up Pat Bradley. Mallon trailed Bradley by three strokes with ten holes to play. It was the second of Mallon's four major titles; she won the LPGA Championship two weeks earlier. Mallon won her second U.S. Women's Open and final major thirteen years later in 2004. Play was so painstakingly slow during the first round that Lori Garbacz decided to protest. While playing the 14th hole, Garbacz had her caddie go to a nearby pay phone and order a pizza that she wanted delivered to the 17th tee. The pizza was waiting for Garbacz and she had plenty of time to eat it, as there were two groups ahead of her waiting to tee off. Mallon won $110,000, the championship's first six-figure winner's share. It was an increase of nearly 30% over the previous year and double that of just four years earlier. Through 2015, this is the only time the championship has been played in the state of Texas. Colonial has been an annual stop on the PGA Tour since 1946; now known as the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, it is usually played in May.

"(148209) 2000 CR105, also written as (148209) 2000 CR105, is the tenth-most-distant known object in the Solar System as of 2015. Considered a detached object, it orbits the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit every 3305 years at an average distance of 222 astronomical units (AU). Mike Brown's website lists it as a possible dwarf planet with a diameter of 328 kilometres (204 mi) based on an assumed albedo of 0.04. The albedo is expected to be low because the object has a blue (neutral) color. However, if the albedo is higher, the object could easily be half that size. (148209) 2000 CR105 and Sedna differ from scattered-disc objects in that they are not within the gravitational influence of the planet Neptune even at their perihelion distances (closest approaches to the Sun). It is something of a mystery as to how these objects came to be in their current, far-flung orbits. Several hypotheses have been put forward: \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a passing star. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by a very distant, and as-yet-undiscovered (albeit unlikely), giant planet. \n*  They were pulled from their original positions by an undiscovered companion star orbiting the Sun. \n*  They were captured from another planetary system during a close encounter early in the Sun's history. According to Kenyon and Bromley, there is a 15% probability that a star like the Sun had an early close encounter and a 1% probability that outer planetary exchanges would have happened.

The Does played in the first two of the WPBL's three seasons, 1978–1979 and 1979–1980, before disbanding. The team played its home games at the Milwaukee Arena and were coached for part of the 1979–1980 season by Larry Costello, who had coached the Bucks from their inception, including an NBA championship in 1971.

Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The opening tip off was between Lynda Gehrke of Milwaukee and Sue Digitale of Chicago, who won the toss.

The forewing length is 2.6 millimetres (0.10 in) for males and 3 millimetres (0.12 in) for females. The forewing ground colour is dark brownish-black with strong purplish-bronze reflections. There is a maximum of five and a minimum of three shining white fasciae comprising: a short basal triangular streak, which is consistently present, in the centre of the wing, contiguous with the tegula. Secondly, a transverse band at mid-length, either as a continuous broad line or only partly represented in the form of either a bold triangular patch on the dorsum or triangular patches on both the costa and the dorsum. Furthermore, a much smaller costal patch and a few white scales in the apex present in all specimens.

"In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year. Their costly service came with success, driving back the Turks in parts of Asia Minor. At Philadelphia, 18,000 Turkish soldiers (possibly those of Aydinids) were left dead, the work of the Catalans. However, the Byzantines got more than what they bargained for; the mercenaries were difficult to restrain and consequently much of the reconquered territory was laid to waste. When their leader Roger de Flor was assassinated in Gallipoli on 3 April 1305 by Michael IX Palaeologus followed by a massacre of 1,300 Catalans, the mercenaries began a two-year pillage in revenge and crossed over to Thrace and Macedonia under the command of their new leader, Berenguer de Entenza, where further raiding occurred. As a result of this brutality, the Company got excommunicated by Pope Clement V. Eventually the Catalan mercenaries claimed the Duchy of Athens for themselves in 1311 and would remain there until 1379, leaving behind a devastated Byzantium. After this, the Turks found much support amongst those who suffered and reoccupied land that had been lost. Thus, the Catalans' campaign was a short-term Byzantine victory, but benefited the Turks in the long term.","In 1303, the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus hired 6,500 Catalan mercenaries under Roger de Flor to campaign against the Turks in the spring and summer of the same year.

"Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a prior of the Carthusian Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley. He was born near Chambéry in 1107. He would later receive an ecclesiastical benefice in the area of Belley. When he was thirty years old, he resigned from this position to become a Carthusian monk at Portes. Only two years after joining the order, he was made the prior of the Grande Chartreuse, the motherhouse of his order, which had recently incurred substantial damage. He was an effective administrator there. While under his direction, the community increased in numbers and fervency. He restored and improved the buildings, including constructing a defensive wall and an aqueduct. The rules of the order were standardized, and changed to allow women the opportunity to enter the order in their own houses. He also brought the other houses of the order into closer alignment with the motherhouse. The monks under his direction included Hugh of Lincoln, who expressed great fondness for Anthelm. Anthelm continued in his office almost constantly for twenty-four years, barring a period of a few years when he was a hermit. After that period, in 1152, Anthelm returned to the Grand Chartreuse, and helped defend the sitting Pope Alexander III against the antipope Victor IV. Alexander III appointed Anthelm bishop of Belley in 1163. In that position, he is said to have been fearless and uncompromising, working to reform the clergy and regulate the affairs of the diocese. One example of his fearlessness occurred in 1175, when Anthelm excommunicated Count Humbert of Maurienne for having taken one priest captive and murdering another priest who had tried to free him. Humbert appealed his excommunication to Pope Alexander III, who reversed Humbert's excommunication. Anthelm, who believed that Humbert was not penitent for his misconduct, withdrew from his diocese in protest. Pope Alexander then commissioned Anthelm to travel to England to try to reconcile Henry II of England and Thomas Becket. Anthelm's health was such that he was unable to take the journey. Anthelm returned to Belley to help care for the poor and the lepers of the area. Anthelm died at Belley in 1178. On his deathbed, he received Humbert, and recognized that at that time Humbert truly had repented of his earlier acts.","Anthelm of Belley (1107–1178) was a prior of the Carthusian Grand Chartreuse and bishop of Belley.

"All Saints' Church is a Church of England parish church in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. The church is on Downshire Square, a tree-lined square in West Reading close to the Bath Road. It is part of the parish of St. Mark and All Saints, which includes St. Mark's Church. The church was built between 1865 and 1874, as a daughter church of the Minster Church of St Mary, to serve the growing population of the Bath Road area. It was designed by the architect James Piers St Aubyn. The construction is of coursed rubble with ashlar dressings and weathered buttresses. The roof is tiled, and the church has a five bay aisled nave with a short transept. The interior includes a painted arcade, a rich five-window apse, and mural mosaics, the finest of which is a glass mosaic reredos depicting the last supper. This came from the London workshop of the renowned glass artist Antonio Salviati and was installed in 1866. The foundations for a tower to the south side of the church were constructed, but the tower itself was never completed. The music for the church was originally provided by a small four-stop organ lent to the church by a \""Father Willis\"", which was positioned in the original North transept. The organ was extensively enhanced to include a triple keyboard and additional pipes between 1874 and 1883, and has remained in more or less the same form until the present day. There is a current project [[appeal]] for the upgrading of the church to modern accessibility standards. This project hopes to add toilet facilities and improve disabled access to the building whilst retaining the church's unique character and architectural features. The church is categorised as a Grade II listed building by English Heritage.","All Saints' Church is a Church of England parish church in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

He [[also]] [[shot]] a [[59]] in an event in Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan]]. Bradley earned his PGA Tour card through qualifying school in 1992 and [[played]] [[full-time]] from 1993 to 2000. He won the 1996 Buick Challenge and the [[1998]] Doral-Ryder Open. 1996 was his best year on the PGA Tour, where he finished in 20th on the money list while recording a win and a runner-up finish. In 1995, he had a notable PGA Championship, becoming one of the few players ever to shoot 63 in the first round of a major; however, Bradley's hot streak then tailed off and he was not among the championship's leaders by Sunday. He then split his playing time between the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour. In 2009, he won his third PGA Tour event at the Puerto Rico Open. This gave him a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, an exemption he extended when he repeated his win at the same event in 2011. After 2013, Bradley could not produce favorable results and played a limited PGA Tour schedule out of the Past Champions category until he joined PGA Tour Champions after turning 50.","Michael John Bradley ([[Vborn]] July [[1]], 1966) is an [[Amherican]] [[rofessional]] golfer.

While the Rollo Coaster features only small hills, it uses [[topography]] to its [[advantage]].

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a [[brewery]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, United [[States]], [[founded]] in 1995 by [[Dan]] and Sue Weirback. The [[brewery]] is well [[known]] for its \""huge taste\"" beers.

Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style. Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon. This process was used to transform Old Heathen into Heresy, Blithering Idiot into Insanity, Merry Monks into Prophecy, and QUAD into Blasphemy. These four styles (imperial stout, barleywine, trippel, and quadrupel) are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors. The results have been widely praised by fans of huge [[beers]], though [[persons]] [[accustomed]] to more mainstream [[beer]] [[may]] [[find]] them an [[acquired]] taste. [[In]] September 2008, Weyerbacher [[released]] a [[limited]] run of a [[seasonal]] [[India]] pale ale, marketed as Harvest Ale (6.2% ABV),that featured a first-year crop of freshly picked, Cascade and Nugget hops grown by the Weirbacks on their farm.

"The Darshan Museum is a museum in Pune, India, dedicated to the noted Sindhi Saint and scholar, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani. It is a biographical museum that offers an insight into the life and therefore the teachings of Sadhu Vaswani. The museum is built on a space of 10000 sq. feet; on the first floor of the Sadhu Vaswani Mission Building. A journey into Sadhu Vaswani's life and activities, the museum creates an entertaining, educative and moving experience for the soul, through a series of immersive spatial experiences rich in audio, video and multimedia, culminating in the darshan of the humble kutiya, where he spent his last years. The museum is also essentially a repository of his teachings – in the form of interactive and participatory exhibits engaging the visitors, young and old alike. This museum has been made by using a vast palette of museum based technologies; like real life mannequins, graphic panels, holographic screens, interactive, audio-visual material, films, et al. The narrative and the dialogues, in the sound and light format, make it a very emotive experience; as opposed to the written [[format]]. This museum is facilitated by ushers who guide visitors thru the 8 zones in this museum, each zone has various experiences from the life and teachings of the Great Master, in the narrative. Visitors have a choice of 2 different languages, viz Hindi and English. The museum was inaugurated by famous Bollywood actor Aamir Khan on 1 August 2011. At the function he went on to felicitate the people who contributed majorly to the project and held a candid question and answer session with revered J. P. Vaswani. The Sadhu Vaswani Mission is a charitable organisation based in Pune with branches all over the world. Originally known as the 'The Brotherhood Association' it was renamed to Sadhu Vaswani Mission upon the demise of its founder and spiritual head, Sadhu T. L. Vaswani. The organisation is well known for its philanthropic work in the fields of education, healthcare, rural development, spiritual upliftment and feeding of the poor through its community kitchens. Its current spiritual head is [[noted]] humanitarian, educationist, philanthropist, poet and modern saint, J. P.

"The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge (known locally as simply the Coleman Bridge) is a double swing bridge that spans the York River between Yorktown and Gloucester Point, in the United States state of Virginia. It connects the Peninsula and Middle Peninsula regions of Tidewater, Virginia. The bridge is the only public crossing of the York River, though State Route 33 crosses both of its tributaries (the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers) at just above its source at West Point. Originally built in 1952, it was reconstructed and widened in 1995 through an unusual process which greatly reduced the time the important commuter artery was out-of-service from conventional methods. The current 3,750-foot (1,140 m)-long double-swing-span bridge carries United States Route 17, a four-lane arterial highway. The movable span is needed to allow ship access to several military installations that are upstream of the bridge, most notably, the United States Navy's Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. The roadways are almost 90 feet (27 m) above the river at the highest point of the bridge. The bridge is the largest double-swing-span bridge in the United States, and second largest in the world. The toll bridge was named for George P. Coleman, who from 1913 to [[1922]] was the head of the Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation, predecessor to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The bridge has been [[one]] of the sites of a special program to establish and encourage nesting locations for the peregrine falcon population of Virginia. The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge is a toll facility. Tolls are only collected northbound, and are used to pay for the expansion of the bridge to four lanes. Toll Collection Rates are as follows: \n* Commuters (E-ZPass required) 85¢ \n* Motorcycles 85¢ \n* Two-axle vehicles $2 \n* Three-axle vehicles $3 \n* Four- or more-axle vehicles $4 Bicycles are permitted to cross and are not required to pay a toll.

"90377 Sedna is a large minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune. Spectroscopy has revealed that [[Sedna's]] [[surface]] composition is [[similar]] to that of some other trans-Neptunian objects, being largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its surface is one of the reddest among Solar System objects. It is most likely a dwarf planet. For most of its orbit, it is even farther from the Sun than at present, with its aphelion estimated at 937 AU (31 times Neptune's distance), making it one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets. Sedna has an exceptionally long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 years to complete and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76 AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to conclude that it is in fact the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or even that it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the [[orbit]] of [[Neptune]]. Astronomer Michael E. Brown, co-discoverer of Sedna and the dwarf planets Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, thinks that it is the most scientifically important trans-Neptunian object found to date, because understanding its unusual orbit is likely to yield valuable information about the origin and early evolution of the Solar System.","90377 Sedna is a large minor planet in the outer reaches of the Solar System that was, as of 2015, at a distance of about 86 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, about three times as far as Neptune.

"Lake Natron is a salt and soda lake in the Arusha Region of northern Tanzania. The lake is close to the Kenyan border and is in the Gregory Rift, which is the eastern branch of the East African Rift. The lake is within the Lake Natron Basin, a Ramsar Site wetland of international significance. The lake is fed principally by the Southern Ewaso Ng'iro River, which rises in central Kenya, and by mineral-rich hot springs. It is quite shallow, less than three metres (9.8 ft) deep, and varies in width depending on its water level. The lake is a [[maximum]] of 57 kilometres (35 mi) long and 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide. The surrounding area receives irregular seasonal rainfall, mainly between December and May totalling 800 millimetres (31 in) per year. Temperatures at the lake are frequently above 40 °C (104 °F). High levels of evaporation have left behind natron (sodium carbonate decahydrate) and trona (sodium sesquicarbonate dihydrate). The alkalinity of the lake can reach a pH of greater than 12. The surrounding bedrock is composed of alkaline, sodium-dominated trachyte lavas that were laid down during the Pleistocene period. The lavas have significant amounts of carbonate but very low calcium and magnesium levels. This has allowed the lake to concentrate into a caustic alkaline brine.","Lake Natron is a salt and soda lake in the Arusha Region of northern Tanzania.

"Lance Gooden ([[born]] December 1, 1982) is a former and incoming Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 4 (Kaufman and a portion of Henderson counties). In the 2010 primary election, Gooden with 50.5 percent of the vote upset the six-term incumbent Republican Representative Betty Brown. Gooden had formerly been Brown's legislative assistant. A native of Terrell in Kaufman County, a city east of Dallas, Texas, Gooden graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, from which he received both a Bachelor of Arts in government and a Bachelor of Business Administration. Upon taking office early in 2011, Gooden worked on the state budget in an attempt to eliminate wasteful spending. He served on these House committees: Appropriations, County Affairs, and House Administration, the latter of which handles employment by the House. In 2010, Gooden had no Democratic opponent in his heavily Republican district. Gooden won renomination to a second term in the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012. He polled 6,385 votes (53.5 percent) to 5,545 (46.5 percent) for his opponent, Stuart Spitzer, a surgeon from Kaufman, who was born and reared in Athens in Henderson County. Gooden was then unopposed for his second term in the general election held on November 6, 2012. However, on March 4, 2014, Dr. Spitzer, in a second bid for the office, unseated Gooden in the Republican primary. Spitzer polled 8,421 votes (51 percent) to Gooden's 8,079 (49 percent). Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, made a campaign stop for Gooden's behalf in Forney in Kaufman County, a month before the primary election. Accompanying Straus to Forney was State Senator Bob Deuell,who lost his own seat in the subsequent May 27 runoff election to the Tea Party movement choice, Bob Hall. In 2016, however, Gooden staged a successful comeback and defeated Spitzer in the March 1 Republican primary, 14,500 votes (51.8 percent) to 13,502 (48.2 percent). He returns to the state House in January 2017. On October 1, 2016, Gooden will wed Alexa Calligas, formerly of Shreveport, Louisiana, whom he met in Austin.

Western music shares similar roots with Appalachian music (also called hillbilly music), which developed in Appalachia separately from, but parallel to, the Western music genre. The music industry of the mid-20th century grouped the two genres together under the banner of country and western music, later amalgamated into the modern name, country music.",0.9638926386833191,0.9638926386833191,2,2,8,1,"Skipped"

Cameron gained a 13% swing but lost by one vote. Cameron challenged the result at the Court of Disputed Returns, which ordered a by-election. Corcoran comfortably won the by-election.

He became an important ally of Steele Hall (now Leader of the Opposition), representing the increasingly visible moderate forces within the party.

This tension within the LCL led to the formation of the Liberal Movement the following year. Led by Hall and Robin Millhouse, the movement originally functioned as a faction within the LCL. Cameron was one of its most prominent supporters. After the 1973 Election, the LCL (led at this stage by Bruce Eastick) expelled the Liberal Movement.

"Edward Mann was a [[London-based]] hatmaker and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century. While Mann was working as a milliner in the 1950s, he became particularly known for his creative 1960s designs, such as designs with incorporated pockets and lace baby-bonnet-style caps. In 1967 he produced a collection inspired by the Common Market, which was shown in Germany as well as in London, and presented on models from across Europe. He was also the designer of the hats worn by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel in the 1960s TV series The Avengers. This led to Mann becoming, briefly, one of the most desirable milliners in London at that time. In 1967, one of Mann's hats was chosen by Felicity Green of The Daily Mirror as part of her Dress of the Year selection for the Fashion Museum, Bath. The hat was made to match an orange and pink striped trouser suit by David Bond for Slimma. In the mid-1970s Edward Mann owned a clothing brand called Buckle Under. By 1982, the Edward Mann company operated as a concessionary brand, selling its hats through eighteen department stores and other retailers, rather than having their own shops.","Edward Mann was a [[London-baseV]] hatmaker and milliner popular in the second half of the 20th century.

Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts.

The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), Keith Godchaux (keyboards; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after. After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. The group performed together again as the Grateful Dead in 2015, with Trey Anastasio of Phish, to mark their fiftieth anniversary, in what the band announced would be their final concerts.

"The pelagic cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), also known as Baird's cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. Analogous to other smallish cormorants, it is also called the pelagic shag occasionally. This seabird lives along the coasts of the northern Pacific; during winter it can also be found in the open ocean. Pelagic cormorants have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird. Many authors favor splitting up the \""wastebin genus\"" Phalacrocorax. In this case, the pelagic cormorant would probably be placed in Compsohalieus.","The pelagic cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus), also known as Baird's cormorant, is a small member of the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae.

It is one of Zeeland's most-visited coasts, and one of the few places in the Netherlands where the beach faces south. Plenty of rooms, studios, bungalows and apartments are available to thousands of visitors every summer; most of the tourists are of German origin, although other nationalities are also widely represented. The remaining agriculture in the area benefits of the demand for accommodation in the form of mini-campings. Bicycle-rental, beachfront establishments, hotels, B&Bs, shops and a nice boulevard are all to be found in and around the village.

"Willie “The Wisp” Galimore (March 30, 1935 – July 27, [[1964]]) was an [[American]] football running [[back]] for the Chicago Bears from 1957–1963. He attended Florida A&M University, [[working]] with the [[legendary]] coach [[Jake]] [[Gaither]]. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. [[His]] running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster. In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced. Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the [[age]] of 29 with teammate Bo [[Farrington]]. [[His]] [[number]] 28 has been retired by the [[Bears]]. His son, [[Ron]] [[Galimore]], was the first [[Black]] U.S. Olympic gymnast. Willie Galimore's last visit to his [[hometown]] of St. [[Augustine]], Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before). Galimore's civil rights activism is honored with a Freedom Trail marker at his home at 57 Chapin Street in St. Augustine. His widow, Mrs. Audrey Galimore, took part in the dedication of the marker on July 2, 2007. A community [[center]] in the historic [[Lincolnville]] [[neighborhood]] of the city also [[bears]] Galimore's [[name]], and he is [[depicted]] on a [[historical]] mural painted by schoolchildren on Washington Street.","Willie “The Wisp” Galimore (March 30, 1935 – July 27, [[1694]]) was an [[Ameriian]] football running [[bacS]] for the Chicago Bears from 1957–1963.
